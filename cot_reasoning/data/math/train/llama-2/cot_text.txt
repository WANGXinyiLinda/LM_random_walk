For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must "meet" at $2$ and $-2$
For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$
This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \Rightarrow a=-3$
Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$
Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$
So $a+b=-3+3=\boxed{0}$.
Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over
Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members
Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98
We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation
If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big
If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98
Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\cdot 7=98$ as it should
This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{98}$.
This polynomial is not written in standard form
However, we don't need to write it in standard form, nor do we need to pay attention to the coefficients
We just look for the exponents on $x$
We have an $x^4$ term and no other term of higher degree, so $\boxed{4}$ is the degree of the polynomial.
Firstly, $3\left(6-\frac12\right)=18-1-\frac12=17-\frac12$
Because $0\le\frac12<1$, we have $\left\lceil17-\frac12\right\rceil=\boxed{17}$.
Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not
We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \begin{align*}
x+y &= 20 \\
60x - 30y &= 660 \\
\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit
Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$
Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$
Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$
This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$
Thus, Sam did not work for $\boxed{6}$ days.
Completing the square, we get $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19$
Therefore, the center of the circle is $\boxed{(3, -1)}$.
First we'll simplify that complicated expression
We attempt to factor the numerator of the left side: \begin{align*}
pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq &= q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p) \\
&= q[ p(q+p) + 3(q+p) ] \\
&= q(p+3)(q+p).
\end{align*}Substituting this in for the numerator in our inequality gives $$\frac{3q(p+3)(p+q)}{p+q}>2p^2q.$$We note that left hand side has $p+q$ in both the numerator and denominator
We can only cancel these terms if $p+q \neq 0.$  Since we're looking for values of $p$ such that the inequality is true for all $q > 0,$ we need $p \geq 0$ so that $p + q \neq 0.$
Also because this must be true for every $q>0$, we can cancel the $q$'s on both sides
This gives  \begin{align*}
3(p+3)&>2p^2\Rightarrow\\
3p+9&>2p^2 \Rightarrow\\
0&>2p^2-3p-9.
\end{align*}Now we must solve this quadratic inequality
We can factor the quadratic as $2p^2-3p-9=(2p+3)(p-3)$
The roots are $p=3$ and $p=-1.5$
Since a graph of this parabola would open upwards, we know that the value of $2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is negative between the roots, so the solution to our inequality is $-1.5<p<3.$  But we still need $0 \leq p,$ so in interval notation the answer is $\boxed{[0,3)}$.
We have  \[\frac{x^4 + 2y^2}{6} = \frac{2^4 + 2(5^2)}{6} = \frac{16+2(25)}{6} = \frac{16+50}{6} = \frac{66}{6} = \boxed{11}.\]
Since $18 - 14 = 4$, the common difference in the first column of squares is 4, so the number above 14 is $14 - 4 = 10$, and the number above 10 is $10 - 4 = 6$
This is also the fourth number in the row, so the common difference in the row is $(6 - 21)/3 = -5$.
Then the seventh (and last) number in the row is $21 - 5 \cdot 6 = -9$
In the second column, the common difference is $[(-17) - (-9)]/4 = -2$, so $N = -9 - (-2) = \boxed{-7}$.
Recall the formula $A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the end balance, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the number of years, and $n$ is the number of times the interest is compounded in a year
This formula represents the idea that the interest is compounded every $1/n$ years with the rate of $r/n$.
Substituting the given information, we have \[60,\!000=P\left(1+\frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5}.\]Solving for $P$ gives  $P=42409.474...$, which rounded to the nearest dollar is $\boxed{\$42409}$.
The center of the circle is located at the midpoint of any diameter
Thus, the center of the circle is $\left(\frac{9+(-3)}{2}, \frac{(-5)+(-1)}{2}\right) = (3, -3)$
The sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is therefore $3 + (-3) = \boxed{0}$.
We substitute $f(2) = 5(2)^2 - \frac{1}{2} + 3 = \frac{45}{2}$ and $g(2) = (2)^2 - k = 4 - k$
So $f(2) - g(2) = 2$ gives us $\frac{45}{2} - 4 + k=2$
Solving for $k$, we find $k = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{45}{2} + \frac{8}{2}$ so $\boxed{k = \frac{-33}{2}}$.
The easiest way to solve this problem is to convert everything into euros
Emily's five-dollar bill is equivalent to $5\text{ USD} \times \frac{1\text{ euro}}{1.25\text{ USD}}=4\text{ euros}$
Since the girls need 6 euros between them, Berengere must contribute $6-4=\boxed{2 \text{ euros}}$.
The first cube root becomes $\sqrt[3]{9}$
$\sqrt[3]{8}=2$, so the second cube root becomes $\sqrt[3]{3}$
Multiplying these gives $\sqrt[3]{27} = \boxed{3}$.
We note that $f(-2)=(-2)^3+3=-5$, so $g(f(-2))=g(-5)=2\cdot(-5)^2+2\cdot(-5)+1=41.$ Therefore our answer is $\boxed{41}$.
Evaluating each value, $f(1) = 3 \cdot 1 + 1 = 4$; $f(f(1)) = f(4) = 4/2 = 2$; $f(f(f(1))) = f(2) = 2/2 = 1$; and finally $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(1) = \boxed{4}$.
We will begin with the smallest possible positive values of $x$
For positive values of $x$, when $0<x<1$, the right side of our equation is equal to $\frac{1}{0}$, which is undefined
When $1 \le x < 2$  , the right side of our equation is equal to $1$, but $x - \lfloor x \rfloor $ cannot equal $1$.
When $2 \le x<3$, the right side of our equation is equal to $\frac{1}{2}$, so we have $x - \lfloor x \rfloor = \frac{1}{2}$
This occurs when $x = 2 \frac{1}{2}$.
When $3 \le x<4$, the right side of our equation is equal to $\frac{1}{3}$, so we have $x - \lfloor x \rfloor = \frac{1}{3}$
This occurs when $x = 3 \frac{1}{3}$.
When $4 \le x<5$, the right side of our equation is equal to $\frac{1}{4}$, so we have $x - \lfloor x \rfloor = \frac{1}{4}$
This occurs when $x = 4 \frac{1}{4}$.
Then the sum of the three smallest positive solutions to $x$ is $2 \frac{1}{2} +3 \frac{1}{3}+4 \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{10\frac{1}{12}}.$
If the graph of $f$ is continuous, then the graphs of the two cases must meet when $x=2,$ which (loosely speaking) is the dividing point between the two cases
Therefore, we must have $2\cdot 2^2 -3 = 2a + 4.$ Solving this equation gives $a = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
If the graph of $f$ is continuous, then the graphs of the two cases must meet when $x=3$, which (loosely speaking) is the dividing point between the two cases
Therefore, we must have $3(3^2) + 2 = 3a - 1$
Solving this equation gives $a = \boxed{10}$.
Since three faucets can fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, six can do it twice as fast, i.e
3 minutes
Additionally, the tub is a quarter the size and thus it will be filled four times as fast which gives $3/4$ minutes or $\boxed{45}$ seconds.
The $y$-axis is where the $x$-coordinate is $0$
Using the given points, as the $x$-coordinate decreases by $2$, the $y$-coordinate decreases by $4$
So as the $x$-coordinate decreases by $1$ from $1$ to $0$, the $y$-coordinate will decrease by $2$ from $7$ to $5$
The point is $\boxed{(0,5)}$.
We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$
This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$
Thus, $$(3x^2) \times (-4) + (-2x) \times (-7x) = -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2,$$and the coefficient is $\boxed{2}$.
We are looking for some $x$ such that $f(x)=64$
We notice that by doubling $x$ we can double $f(x)$ as well and also that $f(3)=1$.
Applying $f(2x)=2f(x)$ repeatedly, we have: \begin{align*}
f(3)&=1,\\
f(6)&=2,\\
f(12)&=4,\\
f(24)&=8,\\
f(48)&=16,\\
f(96)&=32,\\
f(192)&=64.
\end{align*}So $f^{-1}(64)=\boxed{192}$.
By the quadratic formula, the roots of the equation are  \begin{align*}
\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&=\frac{-k\pm\sqrt{k^2-4(5)(1)}}{2(1)}\\
&=\frac{-k\pm\sqrt{k^2-20}}{2}.
\end{align*} We want the difference of the roots, so we take the larger minus the smaller:  \begin{align*}
\left(\frac{-k+\sqrt{k^2-20}}{2}\right)-\left(\frac{-k-\sqrt{k^2-20}}{2}\right)&=\frac{2\sqrt{k^2-20}}{2}\\
&=\sqrt{k^2-20}.
\end{align*} We are given that this difference is equal to $\sqrt{61}$, so we have \begin{align*}
\sqrt{k^2-20}&=\sqrt{61}\quad\Rightarrow\\
k^2-20&=61\quad\Rightarrow\\
k^2&=81\quad\Rightarrow\\
k&=\pm 9.
\end{align*} Thus the greatest possible value of $k$ is $\boxed{9}$.
We begin by cross multiplying and then squaring both sides \begin{align*}
\frac{\sqrt{3x+5}}{\sqrt{6x+5}}&=\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}\\
3\sqrt{3x+5}&=\sqrt{5}\cdot\sqrt{6x+5}\\
\left(3\sqrt{3x+5}\right)^2&=\left(\sqrt{5}\cdot\sqrt{6x+5}\right)^2\\
9(3x+5) &=5(6x+5)\\
20 &= 3x\\
x&=\boxed{\frac{20}{3}}.\\
\end{align*}Checking, we see that this value of $x$ satisfies the original equation, so it is not an extraneous solution.
The side length of the square is the distance between the given points, or $\sqrt{(-1 - 2)^2 + (4 - (-3))^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{58}$
The area of the square is the square of the side length, or $\boxed{58}$.
We can factor $n^2-11n+24$ as $(n-3)(n-8)$
For this quantity to be less than or equal to 0, one of the factors must be less than or equal to 0 and the other factor must be greater than or equal to 0
Specifically, since $n-8<n-3$ for all $n$, we must have $$n-8 \le 0 \le n-3.$$ The first inequality, $n-8\le 0$, tells us that $n\le 8$
The second inequality, $0\le n-3$, tells us that $n\ge 3$
The solutions to the original inequality must satisfy both conditions, so they are given by $3\le n\le 8$
The largest integer in this interval is $n=\boxed{8}$.
Let the two solutions to the equation be $x_1$ and $x_2,$ where $x_1>x_2
$ It follows that  \[x_1 - x_2 = (x_1+5)-(x_2+5) = 20 - (-20) = \boxed{40}.\]
Using the first two conditions, we have that $0 \# 11 = 11 \# 0 = 11.$
Using the third condition, with $r=0$ and $s=11$, we have that $1 \# 11 = (0 \# 11)+12=11+12.$
As we increase $r$ by $1$, we increase $r \# 11$ by $s+1=11+1=12$
Since we want to increase $r$ $5$ times to find $11 \#5 =5 \# 11$, we want to increase $0 \# 11$ by $12$ five times
Therefore, we have $11 \# 5 = 5 \# 11 = 11+ 5 \cdot 12 = 11+60= \boxed{71}.$
More generally,
\[a \# b = ab + a + b.\]
Expanding the left side of the given equation, we have $x^2-x-6=14 \Rightarrow x^2-x-20=0$
Since in a quadratic  with equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ the sum of the roots is $-b/a$, the sum of the roots of the given equation is $1/1=\boxed{1}$.
To get the square root out of the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\sqrt{2}+1)$ so that the $\sqrt{2}$ is squared and $\sqrt{2}$ and $-\sqrt{2}$ cancel each other out
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}-1}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{2}+1}{\sqrt{2}+1}=\frac{\sqrt{2}+1}{2-\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}-1}=\frac{\sqrt{2}+1}{1}=\boxed{\sqrt{2}+1}$$
Let $d$ be the common difference in this arithmetic sequence
Then the $13^{\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 12d = 29$
Solving for $d$, we find $d = 2$
Then the $50^{\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 49 \cdot 2 = \boxed{103}$.
We expand each product separately: \begin{align*}
(2x-5)(x+7) &= 2x(x) + 2x(7) -5(x) -5(7)\\
&=2x^2 +14x - 5x -35\\
&= 2x^2 +9x - 35
\end{align*}and \begin{align*}
(x+5)(2x-1) &=x(2x) + x(-1) +5(2x) + 5(-1)\\
&=2x^2 -x + 10x -5\\
&=2x^2 +9x - 5.
\end{align*}So, we have  \begin{align*}&\ \ \ \ (2x-5)(x+7) - (x+5)(2x-1) \\&= 2x^2+9x -35 - (2x^2 +9x -5) = \boxed{-30}.\end{align*}
Rewrite $\frac{4}{20}$ as $\frac{1}{5}$ and multiply both sides by $5x$ to obtain $x^2=25$
The solutions of this equation are $\pm\sqrt{25}=\pm5$, and their sum is $(-5)+5=\boxed{0}$.
We start by completing the square: \begin{align*}
2x^2 -12x + 3 &= 2(x^2-6x) +3 \\
&= 2(x^2 -6x + (6/2)^2 - (6/2)^2) + 3\\
& = 2((x-3)^2 -3^2) + 3 \\
&= 2(x-3)^2 - 2\cdot 3^2 + 3\\
&= 2(x-3)^2 -15
.\end{align*} Since the square of a real number is at least 0, we have $(x-3)^2\ge 0$, where $(x-3)^2 =0$ only if $x=3$
Therefore, $2(x-3)^2 - 15$ is minimized when $x=\boxed{3}.$
We know that $\lfloor x\rfloor \leq x < \lfloor x\rfloor + 1$
This implies that $\lfloor x\rfloor^2 \leq x\cdot\lfloor x\rfloor < \left(\lfloor x\rfloor + 1\right)^2$ for all values of $x$
In particular since $x\cdot\lfloor x\rfloor=70$ and $8^2<70<9^2$, we can conclude that $8<x<9\Longrightarrow\lfloor x\rfloor=8$
From there, all we have to do is divide to get that $x=\frac{70}{8}=\boxed{8.75}$.
If the length is $l$ and the width is $w$, then the perimeter is $2l+2w$
We can set up the equations $2l+2w=60 \Rightarrow l+w=30$ and $l=2w$
Now we substitute $l$ in terms of $w$ into the first equation and get $l+w=2w+w=30$, so $w=10$ and $l=2(10)=20$
That means the area of the rectangular garden is $lw=20(10)=\boxed{200}$ square feet.
$f(4)=4^2-4=16-4=\boxed{12}$.
For a triangle to exist, the sum of two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third
Therefore, we have three formulas: $x^2+7>10 \to x^2>3$, $x^2+10>7 \to x^2>-3$, and $7+10>x^2 \to x^2<17$
Thus, we have two quadratics, $x^2>3$ and $x^2<17$
Therefore, possible values for $x$ are $\boxed{2, 3, \text{ and } 4}$.
Let our integer be $x$
Then we have that $x^2 = 182 + x$, or $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$
The sum of the roots of this equation is just $-(-1) = \boxed{1}$
Note that we are given that one solution is an integer, and so the other one must be as well since they add to 1.
Note that we can factor $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$ as $(x - 14)(x + 13) = 0$
So the integers that work are 14 and $-13$, and their sum is $14 + (-13) = 1,$ as expected.
To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+64t+31$
We will do this by completing the square
Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \[-16t^2+64t+31=-16(t^2-4t)+31.\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis to get \begin{align*}
-16(t^2-4t)+31&=-16(t^2-4t+4-4)+31\\
&=-16([t-2]^2-4)+31\\
&=-16(t-2)^2+95.
\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+95=\boxed{95}$ feet.
Average speed is defined as distance traveled divided by time traveled
Karen drove 165 miles in $3\frac{40}{60}=3\frac{2}{3}=\frac{11}{3}$ hours, so her average speed was $\frac{165}{\frac{11}{3}}=3\cdot15=\boxed{45}$ miles per hour.
In order for the expression to have a domain of all real numbers, the quadratic $x^2+bx+8 = 0$ must have no real roots
The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 8 = b^2 - 32$
The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 32 < 0$, or $b^2 < 32$
The greatest integer $b$ that satisfies this inequality is $\boxed{5}$.
We might recognize the top as $\frac{2}{3}$, and the bottom as $\frac{4}{3}$, thereby giving you a value of $\frac{1}{2}$
If not, call the numerator $x$
Multiplying by 10, and subtracting $x$, you get 9x = 6, and thus, $x = \frac{2}{3}$
We then notice that the denominator is $1 + \frac{x}{2}$, thereby giving us a value of $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$ for the entire fraction.
If the coordinates of the point halfway between the two points are $(x,y)$, then $x$ must be the average of the $x$-coordinates $3$ and $5$ and $y$ must be the average of the $y$-coordinates $7$ and $1$
The average of $3$ and $5$ is $\frac{3+5}{2}=4$ and the average of $7$ and $1$ is $\frac{7+1}{2}=4$, so the $(x,y) = \boxed{(4,4)}$.
First, remember that the slope of a line in the form of $y=mx+b$ is equal to $m$
So, the line must take the form $y=-7x+b$
Next, substitute the point $(3,0)$ and solve for $b$: \begin{align*}
0&=-7(3)+b\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 0&=-21+b\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 21&=b
\end{align*} Therefore, the value of $m+b$ is $-7+21=\boxed{14}$.
We can rewrite the equation $x^2-6y-3=-y^2-4x$ as $x^2+4x+y^2-6y=3$
Completing the square, we have $(x+2)^2-4+(y-3)^2-9=3$, or $(x+2)^2+(y-3)^2=16$
This is the equation of a circle of radius $r=4$ and with center $(a,b)=(-2,3)$
Therefore, $a+b+r=-2+3+4=\boxed{5}$.
$2f(4)=g(4)$, so $2\left(16-8+m\right)=16-8+4m$
Expanding the left-hand side gives $16+2m=8+4m$, or $8=2m$ and $m=\boxed{4}$.
If $x^2 + tx - 10= (x+a)(x+b)$, then \[x^2 + tx -10 = x^2 + ax +bx +ab = x^2 +(a+b)x + ab.\]Therefore, we must have $ab = -10$, and for any such $a$ and $b$, we have $t = a+b$
Our possibilities are as follows: \[\begin{array}{ccc}a&b&a+b\\\hline
-1 & 10 & 9\\
-2 & 5 & 3\\
-5 & 2 & -3\\
-10 & 1 & -9
\end{array}\]The product of these possible values of $t=a+b$ is $(9)(3)(-3)(-9) = 27^2 = \boxed{729}$.
Since $58=2\cdot29$ and $203=7\cdot29$, we can factor a $29x^5$ from the expression, to get $$58x^5-203x^{11}=\boxed{-29x^5(7x^6-2)}.$$
Perhaps the fastest way is to use the difference of squares factorization: \begin{align*}
(a^2 + b)^2 - (a^2 - b)^2 &= \bigl[ (a^2 + b) + (a^2 - b) \bigr] \cdot
\bigl[ (a^2 + b) - (a^2 - b) \bigr] \\
&= ( a^2 + b + a^2 - b) \cdot (a^2 + b - a^2 +b ) \\
&= (2 a^2 ) \cdot (2 b) \\
&= 4 a^2 b
\end{align*}Since $a= 4$ and $b=1$, this last expression is equal to \[ 4 \cdot 4^2 \cdot 1 = 4 \cdot 16 = \boxed{64}, \]so that is our answer.
We could also plug in the values of $a$ and $b$ right away and then expand
We then get \begin{align*}
(a^2 + b)^2 - (a^2 - b)^2 &= (4^2 + 1)^2 - (4^2 -1)^2 \\
&= (16 + 1)^2 - (16- 1)^2 \\
&= 17^2 - 15^2
\end{align*}Now, $17^2 = 289$, and $15^2 = 225$, so our answer is then \[ 289 - 225 = 89 -25 = 64, \]as before.
We can't read off the exact value of $u(-2.33)$ or $u(-0.81)$ or $u(0.81)$ or $u(2.33)$ from the graph
However, the symmetry of the graph (under $180^\circ$ rotation around the origin) tells us that $u(-x) = -u(x)$ for all $x$ in the visible interval, so, in particular, $$u(-2.33)+u(2.33) = 0\phantom{.}$$and $$u(-0.81)+u(0.81) = 0.$$Thus, the exact value of $u(-2.33)+u(-0.81)+u(0.81)+u(2.33)$ is $\boxed{0}$.
Let $x,y$ be the larger and smaller numbers, respectively
We have $x+y=45$ and $x-y=3$
Thus: $y=\frac{1}{2}((x+y)-(x-y))=\frac{1}{2}(45-3)=\boxed{21}$.
Squaring the equation provided, we get $m^2+2(m)\left(\frac{1}{m}\right) +\frac{1}{m^2}=64,$ so $m^2+\frac{1}{m^2}+4=\boxed{66}$.
Dividing both sides of the equation $11x^2-44x-99$ by $11$, we have $$x^2-4x-9 = 0.$$The square which agrees with $x^2-4x-9$ except for the constant term is $(x-2)^2$, which is equal to $x^2-4x+4$ and thus to $(x^2-4x-9)+13$.
Therefore, by adding $13$ to each side, Krzysztof rewrote the equation $x^2-4x-9 = 0$ as $$(x-2)^2 = 13$$We have $r=-2$, $s=13$, and thus $r+s=\boxed{11}$.
To find $x$ such that $3^x=\frac{1}{\sqrt3}$, notice that multiplying the numerator and denominator of $\frac{1}{\sqrt3}$ by $\sqrt3$ gives us $\frac{\sqrt3}{3},$ and factoring $\frac{\sqrt3}{3}$ gives us $\sqrt{3}\cdot \frac{1}{3},$ which is equal to $3^\frac12 \cdot 3^{-1}.$  Looking back at our original equation, this means that $3^x=3^\frac12 \cdot 3^{-1}=3^{\frac12 + -1},$ and therefore $x=\frac12 + -1=-\frac12.$  Since $3^{-\frac12}=\frac{1}{\sqrt3},$ $\log_3\frac{1}{\sqrt3}=\boxed{-\frac12}.$
We see that $29^2 = (30 - 1)^2 = 30^2 - 2\cdot 30 \cdot 1 +1 = 30^2 - 59$
Therefore, Emily subtracts $\boxed{59}$.
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$
Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$
If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$
So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.
Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$.
We consider two cases, $y\ge 6$ and $y < 6$.
Case 1: $y \ge 6:$  If $y \ge 6$, then $|y-6| = y-6$ and our equation is $y-6+2y=9$
So, we have $3y = 15$, or $y=5$
However, $y=5$ does not satisfy $y\ge 6$
Testing $y=5$, we have $|5-6| + 2\cdot 5 =11$, not 9, and we see that $y=5$ is not a solution.
Case 2: $y < 6:$   If $y<6$, then $|y-6| = -(y-6) = -y+6$, so our equation is $-y+6+2y = 9$, from which we have $y=\boxed{3}$
This is a valid solution, since $y=3$ satisfies the restriction $y<6$.
Since $a$ and $b$ are roots of $x^2 - mx + 2 = 0,$ we have \[
x^2 - mx + 2 = (x-a)(x-b)\quad \text{and} \quad ab = 2.
\] In a similar manner, the constant term of $x^2 - px + q$ is the product of $a + (1/b)$ and $b + (1/a),$ so \[
q=\left(a+\frac{1}{b}\right)\left(b+\frac{1}{a}\right)= ab+1+1+\frac{1}{ab}=\boxed{\frac{9}{2}}.
We iterate the function to find $g$:
\begin{align*}
f(f(x))&=3(3x-2)-2=9x-8\\
f(f(f(x)))&=3(9x-8)-2=27x-26\\
f(f(f(f(x))))&=3(27x-26)-2=81x-80
\end{align*}
This is an increasing, continuous function
The minimum in the domain is at $0$, where it equals $-80$, and the maximum is at $2$, where it equals $-80+2(81)=82$
It covers all values between these, so the range is $\boxed{-80\leq g(x)\leq 82}$.
We will complete the square to determine the standard form equation of the circle
Shifting all but the constant term from the RHS to the LHS, we have $x^2+2x+y^2+10y=-16$
Completing the square in $x$, we add $(2/2)^2=1$ to both sides
Completing the square in $y$, we add $(10/2)^2=25$ to both sides
The equation becomes \begin{align*}
x^2+2x+y^2+10y&=-16\\
\Rightarrow x^2+2x+1+y^2+10y+25&=10\\
\Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y+5)^2&=10
\end{align*} Thus, the center of the circle is at point $(-1,-5)$ so $x+y=-1+(-5)=\boxed{-6}$.
By the distance formula,  \begin{align*}
AP &= \sqrt{(4-0)^2 + (2-0)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4} = 2\sqrt{5} \\
BP &= \sqrt{(4-8)^2 + (2-(-1))^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = 5 \\
CP &= \sqrt{(4-5)^2 + (2-4)^2} = \sqrt{1+4} = \sqrt{5}
\end{align*}Hence, $AP + BP + CP = 5 + 3\sqrt{5}$, and $m+n = \boxed{8}$.
$(3-2i)^2 = (3-2i)(3-2i)= 3(3) + 3(-2i) -2i(3) - 2i(-2i) = 9-6i-6i -4 = \boxed{5-12i}$.
Adding the $d$ terms gives us $14d$
Adding the constant terms gives us $14$
Adding the $d^2$ terms gives us $14d^2$
Adding the terms together gives us ${14d+14+14d^2}$, so $a+b+c = \boxed{42}$.
Recall that two quantities are inversely proportional if their product is constant
Therefore, the product of every pair of consecutive terms of the sequence is the same
Since the first two terms are 2 and 5, the product of every pair of consecutive terms is 10
Therefore, the third term is $10/5=2$, the fourth term is $10/2=5$, and so on
We see that the $n$th term is 5 for every even $n$, so the 12th term is $\boxed{5}$.
Seeing pairwise products, we consider  \[
(f+g+h+j)^2=f^2+g^2+h^2+j^2+2(fg+fh+fj+gh+gj+hj),
\] so \[
fg+gh+hj+fj=\frac{(f+g+h+j)^2-f^2-g^2-h^2-j^2}{2}-(fh+gj).
\] Since the fraction on the right-hand side does not depend on how the values of $f$, $g$, $h$, and $j$ are assigned, we maximize $fg+gh+hj+fj$ by minimizing $fh+gj$
Checking the three distinct values for $fh+gj$, we find that $5\cdot8+6\cdot7=82$ is its minimum value
Therefore, the largest possible value of $fg+gh+hj+fj$ is $\frac{(5+6+7+8)^2-5^2-6^2-7^2-8^2}{2}-82=\boxed{169}$.
We can expand the left side to simplify, or we might notice that $x^2-13x+40 = (x-5)(x-8).$ Thus, we see that $(x-5)(2x+9) = (x-5)(x-8).$ Simplifying, we have $(x-5)(2x+9) - (x-5)(x-8) = (x-5)(x+17) = 0.$ Therefore, $p$ and $q$ are 5 and -17, and $(p + 3)(q + 3) = (8) (-14) = \boxed{-112}.$
Squaring both sides of the left-hand inequality yields $n < 4n-6 \Longrightarrow 6 \le 3n \Longrightarrow 2 \le n$.
Squaring both sides of the right-hand inequality yields $4n-6 < 2n+5 \Longrightarrow 2n < 11 \Longrightarrow n < 5.5$
Thus, $n$ must be one of $\{2,3,4,5\}$, of which we can check all work
As such, the answer is $\boxed{4}$.
We have $(2x+5)^2 = (2\cdot 3 + 5)^2 = 11^2 = \boxed{121}$.
We rewrite the left side $16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}$ as $4\cdot16^{16}=2^2\cdot(2^4)^{16}=2^2\cdot2^{64}=2^{66}$
We have $2^{66}=2^x$, so the value of $x$ is $\boxed{66}$.
Let the page numbers be $n$ and $n + 1.$ Then, the problem can be modeled by the equation $n(n+1) = 18360.$ We can rewrite the equation as $n^2 + n - 18360=0.$
Now using the quadratic formula, we find that $$n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4\cdot 18360}}{2}.$$ So, $n = 135.$ Hence, $n + (n + 1) = \boxed{271}.$
This equation can be factored as well, but that would not save much time
The best way to solve this quickly would be to notice that $18360$ falls between $135^2=18225$ and $136^2=18496,$ so since we know that $n$ is an integer, we can guess that $n = 135.$ Plugging it back into the equation, we see that it works, so $n + (n + 1) = \boxed{271}.$
Let the roots of this polynomial be $r_1$ and $r_2$
Since the sum of the roots of a polynomial $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $-\frac{b}{a}$ and the product of the roots is $\frac{c}{a}$, $r_1+r_2=5$ and $r_1r_2=5$
Squaring the first equation results in $r_1^2+2r_1r_2+r_2^2=25$.
Notice that $(r_1-r_2)^2=r_1^2-2r_1r_2+r_2^2$, so the difference of the roots can be obtained by subtracting 4 copies of the product of the roots from the square of their sum: $r_1^2-2r_1r_2+r_2^2=r_1^2+2r_1r_2+r_2^2-4r_1r_2=25-4(5)=5$
Therefore, $|r_1-r_2|=\boxed{\sqrt{5}}$.
We also could have used the quadratic formula to determine that the roots are $\dfrac{5 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$, and the positive difference of these roots is indeed $\boxed{\sqrt{5}}$.
Subtracting $\frac12$ from both sides gives $\frac1x = \frac56-\frac12 = \frac13$, so taking the reciprocal of both sides gives $x = \boxed{3}$.
Note that the graphs of $y=g(x)$ and $y=h(x)$ are the reflections of the graph of $y=f(x)$ across the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis, respectively
Thus, the original graph intersects these two graphs at its $x$-intercepts and $y$-intercepts, respectively

[/asy] Since the original graph has 2 $x$-intercepts and 1 $y$-intercept, we have $a=2$ and $b\ge 1$
Since the original function is not invertible, it ${\it could}$ intersect its reflection across the $y$-axis elsewhere than at a $y$-intercept, but the graph clearly shows that it does not, so $b=1$ and $10a+b = 10(2)+1 = \boxed{21}$.
Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation, we have $x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0$
The sum of the roots of this quadratic is negative its linear coefficient, which is $\boxed{5}$.
(The above is true because if a quadratic has roots $r$ and $s$, we have $(x-r)(x-s) = x^2 - (r+s)+rs = 0$.)
To begin, we first consider the $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3} + 1}$ term
We can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to get $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}+1} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{\sqrt{3}-1} = \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{3-1} = \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{2}.$$We can then substitute this back into our original expression and multiply both the numerator and denominator by $2$ to get  \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{1+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}+1}} & = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{2}} \\
& = \frac{2}{2 + \sqrt{3} - 1} \\
& = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3} + 1}.
\end{align*}If we multiply both the numerator and denominator of this expression by $\sqrt{3}-1$ and simplify, we end up with  \begin{align*}\frac{2}{\sqrt{3} + 1} &= \frac{2}{\sqrt{3} + 1} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{\sqrt{3}-1} \\&= \frac{2(\sqrt{3}-1)}{3 - 1} = \frac{2(\sqrt{3}-1)}{2} = \boxed{\sqrt{3}-1}.\end{align*}
The common difference for this arithmetic sequence is $10 - 1 = 9$, so the $21^{\text{st}}$ term is $1 + 9 \cdot 20 = \boxed{181}$.
The product of two positive numbers is positive, and the product of two negative numbers is also positive
Therefore, if the product of two numbers is less than or equal to $0$, then one of the numbers must be greater than or equal to $0$ and one of the numbers must be less than or equal to $0$.
If $(n+3)(n-7)\le 0$, then because we know $n+3\ge n-7$, we must specifically have $n+3\ge 0$ and $n-7\le 0$
The first condition, $n+3\ge 0$, is true when $n\ge -3$
The second condition, $n-7\le 0$, is true when $n\le 7$
Since both conditions must be true, the only solutions are the integers from $-3$ through $7$ (inclusive)
These are $$n = -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.$$ Counting, we see that there are $\boxed{11}$ solutions.
When $x=-1$, we have $y = a-b+c$
The graph appears to pass through $(-1,-2)$
Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, we know that $y$ is an integer when $x=-1$, so the graph does indeed pass through $(-1,-2)$
Therefore, $y=-2$ when $x=-1$, so $a-b+c = \boxed{-2}$.
Any two consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence must have a common difference
So, $(x-1) - \frac{1}{2} = (3x) - (x-1)$, or $x - \frac{3}{2} = 2x+1$
Solving gives $x = \boxed{-\frac{5}{2}}$.
Note that $\left(x^4+6\right)^2=x^8+12x^4+36$
So $\frac{x^8+12x^4+36}{x^4+6}=\frac{\left(x^4+6\right)^2}{x^4+6}=x^4+6$
Our answer is therefore $5^4+6=625+6=\boxed{631}$.
Squaring both sides of the first equation, we get that $x^2-2xy+y^2=225$
So, we know that $x^2+y^2=225+2xy$
Since $xy=4$, we find $x^2+y^2=225+2(4)=\boxed{233}$.
Moving terms to the LHS, we have $x^2+4x+y^2-6y=-12$
Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(4/2)^2=4$ to both sides
Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(6/2)^2=9$ to both sides
We are left with the equation $x^2+4x+4+y^2-6y+9=1 \Rightarrow (x+2)^2+(y-3)^2=1$
Thus, our circle has center $(-2,3)$
The distance between this center and the point $(1,7)$ is $\sqrt{(1-(-2))^2+(7-3)^2}=\boxed{5}$.
Let the geometric sequence have common ratio $r$
We know that $3\cdot r^3=192$, or $r=4$
Thus, the third term is $3 \cdot r^2 = 3 \cdot 4^2 = \boxed{48}$.
There is a vertical asymptote where the denominator equals 0 and thus $y$ is undefined
For the denominator to equal 0, we have $5x-7=0\Rightarrow x=\boxed{\frac{7}{5}}$.
Let the geometric sequence have common ratio $r$
We know that $2\cdot r^4=162$, or $r=3$
Thus, the sixth term is $2 \cdot r^5 = 2 \cdot 3^5 = \boxed{486}$.
Let the center of the circle be $(x,0)$
Then we know the distance from the center to $(0,4)$ and from the center to $(1,3)$ are the same
Using the distance formula, we have  \begin{align*}
\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(0-4)^2}&=\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(0-3)^2}\\
\Rightarrow\qquad \sqrt{x^2+16}&=\sqrt{(x-1)^2+9}\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x^2+16&=(x-1)^2+9\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x^2+16&=x^2-2x+1+9\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 16&=-2x+10\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 6&=-2x\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x&=-3
\end{align*} Now we know the center of the circle is $(-3,0)$, and we need to find the radius
Use the distance formula once more: \begin{align*} \sqrt{(-3-0)^2+(0-4)^2}&=\sqrt{(-3)^2+(-4)^2}\\&=\sqrt{9+16}\\&=\sqrt{25}=\boxed{5}.\end{align*}
Let the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_1$ be $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{33}$
Then, by the midpoint formula, the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_2$ are $\frac{x_1+x_2}2,\frac{x_2+x_3}2,\ldots,\frac{x_{33}+x_1}2 $
The sum of these equals $\frac{2x_1+2x_2+\cdots +2x_{33}}2=x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_{33}$
Similarly, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$ equals the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of  $P_2$
Thus the desired answer is $\boxed{99}$.
For $x > -2$, $\dfrac{1}{x+2}$ takes on all positive values
Thus, $f(x)$ takes on all positive integers for $x > -2$.
For $x < -2$, $\dfrac{1}{x+2}$ takes on all negative values
Thus, $f(x)$ takes on all negative integers for $x < -2$.
So, the range of $f(x)$ is all integers except for $\boxed{0}$.
First, we notice that $f(2) = 1$, so $f^{-1}(1) = 2$
Hence, $$f^{-1}(f^{-1}(f^{-1}(1))) = f^{-1}(f^{-1}(2)).$$Next, $f(5) = 2$, so $f^{-1}(2) = 5$
Thus, $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(2)) = f^{-1}(5)$
Finally, $f(3) = 5$, so $f^{-1}(5) = 3$
Thus, $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(f^{-1}(1))) = \boxed{3}.$
$\dfrac{21}{\sqrt{21}} = \dfrac{21}{\sqrt{21}} \cdot \dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{\sqrt{21}} = \dfrac{21\sqrt{21}}{21} = \boxed{\!\sqrt{21}}$.
If $x<-7$, both $x+7$ and $x-2$ are negative
So  $$y=-(x+7)-(-x+2)=-9.$$ If $x\geq 2$, both $x+7$ and $x-2$ are nonnegative
So  $$y=x+7-x+2=9.$$ If $-7\leq x< 2$, $x+7$ is nonnegative and $x-2$ is negative
So  $$y=x+7-(-x+2)=2x+5.$$ Then, $2(-7)+5=-9$, and $2(2)+5=9$
The function is increasing and continuous, so all values between $-9$ and $9$ are produced, and no others
Thus the range is $y \in \boxed{[-9, 9]}$.
Since $a^2$ varies inversely with $b^3$, $(a^2)(b^3)=k$ for some constant $k$
If $a=7$ when $b=3$, then $k=(7^2)(3^3)=(49)(27)=1323$
So if $b=6$, \begin{align*} (a^2)(6^3)&=1323
\\ 216a^2&=1323
\\\Rightarrow\qquad a^2&=\boxed{6.125}
\end{align*}
Writing the right side with $5$ as the base, we have $125^x = (5^3)^x = 5^{3x}$, so our equation is: $$5^{x + 4} = 5^{3x}.$$Then, setting the exponents equal, we obtain $$x + 4 = 3x.$$This yields $2x = 4 \implies \boxed{x = 2}$
First, we note that $\left(\frac18\right)^{-1} = 8$, so the equation is $(x-4)^3 = 8$
Taking the cube root of both sides gives $x-4 = 2$, so $x=\boxed{6}$.
The term $x^2$ is simply the average of $1^2 = 1$ and $3^2 = 9$, so $x^2 = (1 + 9)/2 = 5$
Because $x > 0$, $x = \boxed{\sqrt{5}}$.
We set the temperature equal to 77 degrees: \begin{align*}
-t^2 +12t+50&=77\\
t^2-12t+27&=0\\
(t-3)(t-9)&=0
\end{align*}We see then that the temperature is 77 degrees exactly twice: at $t=3$ and $t=9$, so our answer is $\boxed{9}$.
The given expression can be rewritten as $2x+8x^2+9-4+2x+8x^2$
Combining like terms, this last expression is equal to $(2x+2x)+(8x^2+8x^2)+(9-4)=\boxed{16x^2+4x+5}$.
Substituting in $x=2$, we obtain the equations
\begin{align*}
y+6&=a,\\
5y+4&=2a.
\end{align*}
Multiplying the first equation by $5$ and subtracting it from the second equation, we find
$$-26=-3a\Rightarrow a=\boxed{\frac{26}{3}}.$$
Notice that in the system of equations, each variable is added twice and subtracted once
Thus, when we add all four equations together, the result is $a+b+c+d=5+6+3+2=\boxed{16}$.
Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get the quadratic  \begin{align*} x^2+5x-6&<0 \quad \Rightarrow
\\ (x+6)(x-1)&<0.
\end{align*} Since -6 and 1 are both roots of the quadratic, the inequality changes signs at these two points
So, we need to test the signs of three ranges of numbers: $x<-6$, $-6<x<1$, $x>1$
When $x<-6$, both $(x+6)$ and $(x-1)$ will be negative, thus making the inequality positive
When $-6<x<1$, only $(x-1)$ will be negative, thus making the inequality negative
Finally when $x>1$, both $(x+6)$ and $(x-1)$ will be positive, thus making the inequality positive once again
Therefore, the only range of $x$ that satisfies the inequality is $\boxed{(-6, 1)}$.
We want to break up the rational function on the right into a polynomial and a term with constant numerator
To do this, we notice that $-3x^2+15x$ is a multiple of $x-5$, hence
\[\frac{-3x^2+12x+22}{x-5}=\frac{-3x^2+15x-15x+12x+22}{x - 5}=-3x+\frac{-3x+22}{x-5}.\]Now notice that $-3x+15$ is also a multiple of $x-5$, so
\[-3x+\frac{-3x+22}{x-5}=-3x+\frac{-3x+15+7}{x-5}=-3x-3+\frac{7}{x-5}.\]Thus $B=-3$ and $A=7$, so $A+B=\boxed{4}$.
We have $t^2 -49 = t^2 - 7^2 = \boxed{(t-7)(t+7)}$.
We have $(x+y)^2=x^2+y^2+2xy=90+2\cdot27=144$, so $x+y=12$ or $x+y=-12$
We want the larger value, or $x+y=\boxed{12}$.
The product of the roots of this quadratic is $-28/1=-28$, so the other solution must be $-28/-7=4$
That means that the sum of the solutions is $-7+4=-3$
The sum of the solutions is also $-b/1=-b$
Thus, $-b=-3$ and $b=\boxed{3}$.
Since $-\sqrt{\frac{49}{4}}$ is equal to $-\frac{7}{2}$, the smallest integer greater than $-\frac{7}{2}$ is $\boxed{-3}$.
Let $p$ be the number of pie crusts, and let $f$ be the amount of flour per crust
Because the total amount of flour needs to remain constant, we can express the relationship between pie crusts as $p\cdot f = c$, where $c$ is a constant value.
Since we know that 30 pie crusts each use up $\frac16$ cup of flour, $30\left(\frac16\right)=c$ or $c=5$
When $p=20$, the equation becomes $20\cdot f=5$, or $f=\frac5{20}=\boxed{\frac14}$
The slope of a line through two points, $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, is \[\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.\]Let $(x_1,y_1) = (4,5)$ and $(x_2,y_2) = (8,17)$
Then the slope of the line through the two points is \[\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{17 - 5}{8 - 4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3.\]Thus, $a = 3$.
$b$ satisfies $y = 3x + b$ for all points on its graph
Since $(4,5)$ lies on the the graph of $y = 3x + 5$, we can substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 5$ to solve for $b$
$5 = 3(4) + b$ and subtracting 12 from both sides yields $b = -7$
Therefore, $a - b = 3 - (-7) = \boxed{10}$.
Notice that if we add $a^4$ to both sides of the first equation, we get $a^7xy-a^6y-a^5x +a^4=a^4b^4$
Factoring the left side gives $(a^3x-a^2)(a^4y-a^2)=a^4b^4$
So, $(m,n,p)=(3,2,4)$, which means $mnp=3\cdot2\cdot4=\boxed{24}$.
We could multiply this out, but that would be tedious
Instead, we multiply the entire expression by $\frac{2-1}{2-1}$ and use differences of squares: \begin{align*}
&\ \ \ \ \frac{1}{2-1}(2 - 1)(2 + 1)(2^2 + 1^2)(2^4 + 1^4) \\
&= (2^2 - 1^2)(2^2 + 1^2)(2^4 + 1^4) \\
&= (2^4 - 1^4)(2^4 + 1^4) \\
&= 2^8 - 1^8 \\
&= \boxed{255}.
\end{align*}
Solution 1
Note that \[\begin{aligned}  \left(x+\frac{1}{y} \right) \left(y+\frac{1}{z} \right) \left(z+\frac{1}{x} \right) &= xyz + x+y+z + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{xyz} \\&= xyz + \left(x+\frac{1}{y} \right) + \left(y+\frac{1}{z} \right) + \left(z+\frac{1}{x} \right) + \frac{1}{xyz}.\end{aligned}\]Plugging in the given values, we have \[4 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{7}{3} = xyz + 4 + 1 + \frac{7}{3} + \frac{1}{xyz}\]or \[\frac{28}{3} = xyz + \frac{22}{3} + \frac{1}{xyz}.\]Thus, $xyz + \frac{1}{xyz} = 2$
Multiplying by $xyz$ and rearranging, we get $(xyz-1)^2 = 0$, so $xyz=\boxed{1}$.
Solution 2
Repeatedly substitute, in order to create an equation in a single variable
The second equation gives $y = 1- \frac{1}{z}$, and the third equation gives $z = \frac{7}{3} - \frac{1}{x}$, so \[4 =x + \frac{1}{y} = x + \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{z}} = x + \frac{z}{z - 1} = x + \frac{\frac{7}{3} - \frac{1}{x}}{\frac{4}{3} - \frac{1}{x}}.\]Simplifying and multiplying to clear denominators, we get the quadratic $(2x-3)^2 = 0$
Thus, $x = \frac{3}{2}$, so $z = \frac{7}{3} - \frac{1}{x} = \frac{5}{3}$ and $y = 1- \frac{1}{z} = \frac{2}{5}$
Therefore, the answer is \[xyz = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{3} = \boxed{1}.\]
The given expression can be rewritten as $3x+7x^2+5-2+3x+7x^2$
Combining like terms, this last expression is equal to $(3x+3x)+(7x^2+7x^2)+(5-2)=\boxed{14x^2+6x+3}$.
Since we know that $f(x)=x^2+1$ and $g(x)=2x-1$, the expression for $f(g(x))$ is just $(2x-1)^2+1$
From here, we can just plug 5 in as the value for $x$
\begin{align*} (f(g(5))&=(2(5)-1)^2+1
\\ &=(10-1)^2+1
\\ &=(9)^2+1
\\ &=81+1
\\ &=\boxed{82}
\end{align*}
The value $\sqrt{140}$ lies between the two nearest integers
Let the two nearest integers be $z_1$ and $z_2$
Then we have $$z_1<\sqrt{140}<z_2$$Because all values in the inequality are positive, it is appropriate to square each value and obtain $$z_1^2<140<z_2^2$$We only need the value of the perfect square greater than 140, which is 144
Thus the least integer greater than $\sqrt{140}$ is $\sqrt{144}=\boxed{12}$.
First, we start by squaring both sides of the equation \begin{align*} (\sqrt{2x^2+1})^2& =(\sqrt{19})^2
\\ 2x^2+1& =19
\\\Rightarrow 2x^2& =18
\\\Rightarrow x^2& =9
\end{align*}From here, we can see that the only possible values of $x$ are 3 and -3
Therefore the average is $\boxed{0}$.
Since $f$ is the function that adds two, $f^{-1}$ is the function that subtracts two
Since $g$ is the function that divides by $3,$ $g^{-1}$ is the function that triples
This lets us compute from inside out: \[\begin{array}{rl|l}
&f(g^{-1}(f^{-1}(f^{-1}(g(f(19))))))\\
&\quad=f(g^{-1}(f^{-1}(f^{-1}(g(21)))))&\text{added 2}\\
&\quad=f(g^{-1}(f^{-1}(f^{-1}(7))))&\text{divided by 3}\\
&\quad=f(g^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)))&\text{subtracted 2}\\
&\quad=f(g^{-1}(3))&\text{subtracted 2}\\
&\quad=f(9)&\text{tripled}\\
&\quad=\boxed{11}&\text{added 2}\\
\end{array}\]
We find that the midpoint is $\left(\frac{8+2}{2},\frac{5-1}{2}\right) = (5, 2)$
Thus, our answer is $5 + 2 = \boxed{7}$.
Note that the graph of $g(x)$ is identical to the graph of $f(x)$ shifted $a$ units to the left
(This is true because if $(x,f(x))$ is a point on the graph of $f$, then $(x-a,f(x))$ is the corresponding point on the graph of $g$.)
The graph of a function and its inverse are reflections of each other across the line $y=x$
Therefore, if $g(x)$ is its own inverse, then the graph of $g(x)$ must be symmetric with respect to the line $y=x$.
The graph of $f(x)$ is symmetric with respect to the line $y=x-2$: [asy]

Therefore, to make this graph symmetric with respect to $y=x$, we must shift it $2$ places to the left: [asy]

So, $a=\boxed{2}$.
We first find the $y$-coordinate of the intersection point by substituting $x = -8.4$ into the second equation
This gives us $0.5(-8.4) + y = 14$, so $y = 14 - (0.5)(-8.4) = 14 -(-4.2) = 14 + 4.2 = 18.2$
Substituting $x = -8.4$ and $y=18.2$ into the first equation gives  \[k = -2x + y = -2(-8.4) + 18.2 = 16.8 + 18.2 = \boxed{35}.\]
A faster way to solve this problem is to eliminate $y$ by subtracting the first equation from the second
This gives us $0.5x - (-2x) = 14 - k$, so  $2.5x = 14-k$
When $x = -8.4$, this gives us $14 - k = 2.5(-8.4) = -21$, and solving this equation gives $k = \boxed{35}$.
We need to find two numbers with a product of $A0$ and a sum of $1A$, where $A$ is a positive single digit
There are only 9 digits to try for $A$
Suppose we have a product of 10 and a sum of 11, then the two numbers could be 1 and 10
Suppose we have a product of 20 and a sum of 12, then the two numbers are 2 and 10
This will work for all values of $A$ from 1 to 9, so there are $\boxed{9\text{ values}}$ of $A$ that work.
If we start by looking at the first inequality, we see it is equivalent to $3>x,$ so the only possible positive integers $x$ could be are $x=1$ or $x=2.$ Now, looking at the second equation, if $x=2$ we have $$3(2)-a>-6 \Rightarrow 12>a$$ If $x=1,$ then $$3(1)-a>-6 \Rightarrow 9>a.$$ We want $x=2$ to be the only solution
Thus, we must choose $a=9,$ $10,$ $11.$ This is $\boxed{3}$ possible values.
We can tell that $x-1=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{1+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{1+...}}$, and then $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{x-1}=1+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{1+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{1+...}}=x$
Solving for $x$, we find $\sqrt{2}=x(x-1)$, which means $x^{2}-x=\sqrt{2}$
Simplify the denominator of $\frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)}$ to obtain $\frac{1}{x^2-x-2}$
Substituting for $x^2-x$, we get $\frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}-2}$
To rationalize the denominator, we multiply by the conjugate of $\sqrt{2}-2$
We have $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}-2} = \frac{1\cdot(\sqrt{2}+2)}{(\sqrt{2}-2)\cdot(\sqrt{2}+2)} = \frac{\sqrt{2}+2}{2-4} = \frac{2+\sqrt{2}}{-2}.$ Here, we have $A=2, B=2$, and $C=-2$
So, taking the sum of the absolute values of $A$, $B$, and $C$ yields $\boxed{6}$.
We can factor the expression $x-3$ out of each term: \[2x(x-3) + 3(x-3) = 2x\cdot (x-3) + 3\cdot (x-3) = \boxed{(2x+3)(x-3)}.\] If you don't quite see how this works, suppose we put $A$ in place of $x-3$ everywhere in the original expression
Then we can see the factoring more clearly: \[2xA +3A = 2x\cdot A + 3\cdot A = (2x+3)A.\] Putting $x-3$ back in for $A$, we have our factorization: $(2x+3)(x-3)$.
The given information tells us that $$\begin{array}{c@{\qquad}c}
h(2)=j(2)=2, & h(4)=j(4)=6, \\
h(6)=j(6)=12, & h(8)=j(8)=12.
\end{array}$$If the graphs of $y=h(2x)$ and $y=2j(x)$ intersect at $(a,b),$ then $$h(2a)=2j(a)= b.$$Checking the possibilities in the table above, we see that $h(8)=2j(4)=12.$ Thus, the graphs of $y=h(2x)$ and $y=2j(x)$ intersect at $(4,12),$ the sum of whose coordinates is $\boxed{16}.$
The problem is to simplify $\frac{\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{4}}{\sqrt{5}\cdot\sqrt{6}\cdot\sqrt{7}}$
Writing $\sqrt{6}$ as $\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3}$ shows that it is possible to cancel a $\sqrt{2}$ and a $\sqrt{3}$ top and bottom
Also, simplify $\sqrt{4}$ to $2$
This gives $\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}\cdot\sqrt{7}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{35}}$
Finally, to rationalize the denominator, multiply top and bottom by $\sqrt{35}$ to get $\boxed{\frac{2\sqrt{35}}{35}}$.
The expansion of $(x+m)^2+\frac{1}{12}$ is $x^2+2mx+m^2+\frac{1}{12}$, which has a constant term of $m^2+\frac{1}{12}$
This constant term must be equal to the constant term of the original quadratic, so $$m^2+\frac{1}{12} = \frac13,$$and $$m^2 = \frac13-\frac{1}{12} = \frac14.$$This yields the possibilities $m=\frac12$ and $m=-\frac12$.
If $m=\frac12$, then $(x+m)^2+\frac{1}{12} = x^2+x+\frac14+\frac{1}{12} = x^2+x+\frac13$
This implies $b=1$, but we reject this possibility because we were told that $b$ is a negative number.
If $m=-\frac12$, then $(x+m)^2+\frac{1}{12} = x^2-x+\frac14+\frac{1}{12} = x^2-x+\frac13$, giving the result $b=\boxed{-1}$.
Since $f(n)=n^2$ is a monotonically increasing function (on the set of positive integers), we can find the least and greatest integer solutions and count the integers between them
Since $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225$, $n=15$ is the smallest solution
Since $30^2=900$, $n=29$ is the largest solution
There are $29-15+1=\boxed{15}$ integers between 15 and 29 inclusive.
On the second, third, fourth, and fifth trips, you eat $\frac1{2^2}$, $\frac1{2^3}$, $\frac1{2^4}$, and $\frac1{2^5}$ of the pizza, respectively
The total portion of the pizza eaten is the geometric series \begin{align*}
\frac12+\frac1{2^2}+\frac1{2^3}+\frac1{2^4}+\frac1{2^5} &= \frac{\frac12\left(1-\left(\frac12\right)^5\right)}{1-\frac12}\\
&=1-\left(\frac12\right)^5\\
&=1-\frac1{32}\\
&=\boxed{\frac{31}{32}}.
\end{align*}
The only time this expression is not defined is when the denominator is equal to 0
In other words, we are looking for all solutions to the equation $x^2 - 20x + 100 = 0$
We can find the roots by factoring the quadratic into $(x - 10)(x - 10) = 0$ or by using the quadratic formula: $$x = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{(-20)^2-4(1)(100)}}{2}.$$ Either way, we see that $x = 10$ is the only time when the denominator of our expression is equal to 0
Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{10}$.
The equation $f^{-1}(x)=4$ is equivalent to $x=f(4)$
Therefore we want to find the value $f(4)$
We compute $f(4) = 3 \cdot 4^3 + 2 = \boxed{194}$.
Let $d$ equal the cost of a 70 mile taxi ride
Since we know that Ann was charged $120 dollars a 50 mile taxi ride, we can set up the proportion $\frac{120}{50}=\frac{d}{70}$
If we solve for $d$ by multiplying both sides by 70, we find that $d=\left(\frac{120}{50}\right)(70)=\boxed{168}$ dollars.
Call the common difference between any two consecutive terms $x$
We can express the first four terms in terms of $x$ and the fifth term: The fourth term is $5-x$, the third is $5-2x$, etc
So, we have $(5-4x) + (5-3x) + (5-2x) + (5-x) = 10$, which simplifies to $-10x = -10$, or $x = 1$
So the sixth term is $5+1 = \boxed{6}$.
First, we find an expression for $h(x)$
From our definition of $h$, we have $h(4y-1) = 2y+7$
So, if we let $x=4y-1$, so that $y = (x+1)/4$, we have  \[h(x) = 2\cdot\frac{x+1}{4} + 7 = \frac{x+1}{2} + 7.\] Setting this equal to $x$ gives \[x =\frac{x+1}{2} + 7.\] Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $2x = x+1 + 14$, so $x = \boxed{15}$.
The given ratio tells us that $\frac{b}{a}=3$ or that $b=3a$
We substitute this value for $b$ so we have an equation with only one variable
We find  \begin{align*}
3a&=12-5a \\
\Rightarrow \quad 8a&=12 \\
\Rightarrow \quad a &= 12/8 \\
\Rightarrow \quad a &= \boxed{\frac{3}{2}}.
\end{align*}
We are solving for the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $\pi$
Since $\pi$ is approximately $3.14$, the answer is $\boxed{3}$.
Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we have \begin{align*}
\dfrac{5+12i}{2-3i} \cdot \frac{2+3i}{2+3i} &= \frac{5(2) + 5(3i) + 12i(2) +12i(3i)}{2(2) + 2(3i) + -3i(2) -3i(3i)}\\
& = \frac{-26+39i}{13} \\
&= \boxed{-2+3i}.
\end{align*}
We note that $\sqrt{9 \cdot 9^t} = 3 \cdot 3^t$
The equation becomes: \begin{align*}
3 \cdot 3^t + 3 \cdot 3^t &= 18\\
\Rightarrow 6 \cdot 3^t &= 18 \\
\Rightarrow 3^t &= 3.
\end{align*}Therefore, $t = \boxed{1}$.
We start by writing the decimal as a fraction, and we find \begin{align*}
\sqrt{\sqrt[3]{0.000064}} &= \sqrt{\sqrt[3]{\frac{64}{10^6}}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2^6}{10^6}\right)^{\frac13}}\\
&=\sqrt{\frac{2^{6\cdot \frac{1}{3}}}{10^{6\cdot \frac13}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2^2}{10^2}} = \frac{2}{10} = \boxed{0.2}.
\end{align*}
We have  \[\frac{1}{2} x^6 y^7 = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^6\left(\frac43\right)^7 = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{3^6}{4^6} \cdot \frac{4^7}{3^7}
=\frac{1}{2} \cdot\frac{3^6}{3^7} \cdot \frac{4^7}{4^6} = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot 4 = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.\]
We also could have tackled this problem quickly by noticing that if $x=\frac34$ and $y=\frac43$, then $xy=1$, so $\frac{1}{2}x^6y^7 = \frac{1}{2} (xy)^6y=\frac{1}{2}\cdot 1^6y = \frac{1}{2}y = \frac{2}{3}$.
Since $g(a) = 3a-4$, the equation $g(a)=0$ means $3a-4=0$
Solving this equation gives $a = \boxed{\frac{4}{3}}$.
First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil \cdot x$ is nonpositive
Now, knowing that $\lceil x \rceil - 1 < x \leq \lceil x \rceil,$ we see that $\lceil x \rceil$ must be $12,$ since $11 \cdot 11 < 135 \leq 12 \cdot 12.$
Now we see that $\lceil x \rceil \cdot x = 12x = 135,$ so $x = \frac{135}{12} = \boxed{11.25}.$
Because $k > 0$, $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $[1, \infty)$
We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ increases without bound
Hence, on the interval $[1,\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values greater than or equal to 1, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{[1,\infty)}$.
Completing the square, we add $(12/2)^2=36$ to both sides of the equation to get $x^2+12x+36=109 \Rightarrow (x+6)^2=109$
Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x+6=\sqrt{109}$ (we take the positive square root because we want the positive solution), or $x=\sqrt{109}-6$
Thus, $a=109$ and $b=6$, so $a+b=\boxed{115}$.
This equation is solved by \[h(x)=(3x^2-5x+3)-(9x^3-3x+1)=\boxed{-9x^3+3x^2-2x+2}\]
Plugging in, we have that $2^x + 4\times 11 = 300$
This rearranges to $2^x = 256$, or $x = \boxed{8}$.
\begin{align*}
(f(f(f(f(1)))))
&=f(f(f(f(-1))))\\
&=f(f(f(7)))\\
&=f(f(-49))\\
&=f(-41)\\
&=\boxed{-33}.\\
\end{align*}
We could evaluate directly: \begin{align*}
[ a-(b-c) ] - [(a-b) - c ] &= [17 - (21-5)] - [(17-21)-5]\\
&= [17-16] - [-4-5]\\
&= 1 - (-9) = \boxed{10}.
\end{align*}
We also could have simplified the expression first: \begin{align*}
[ a-(b-c) ] - [(a-b) - c ] &= [a-b+c] - [a-b-c]\\
&=a-b+c -a+b+c\\
\end{align*} Then, we have $2c = 2(5) = 10$.
Since $q(4) = 3\cdot 4 - b = 12-b$, we can write $p(q(4)) = 7$ as $p(12-b) = 7$
Since $p(x) = 2x-7$, we have $p(12-b) = 2(12-b) - 7 = 17 - 2b$
Substituting this into $p(12-b) = 7$ gives $17-2b =7$, from which we have $b = \boxed{5}$.
The area of a square equals the side length squared, so we can get the ratio of side lengths by taking the square root of the ratio of areas: $$\sqrt{\frac{32}{63}}=\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{63}}=\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3\sqrt{7}}=\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3\sqrt{7}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{7}}=\frac{4\sqrt{14}}{21}.$$So, our answer is $4+14+21=\boxed{39}$.
$(x-y)(x+y)=(10-15)(10+15) = (-5)(25) = \boxed{-125}$.
Factoring, we find that $x^2 - 11x - 42 = (x - 14)(x + 3) = 0.$ Therefore, our solutions are $-3$ and $14,$ and the larger of those two values is $\boxed{14}.$
We have $5^4=625$, so $\log_5 625 = \boxed{4}$.
The number of men and the amount of time to dig the foundation are inversely proportional
Let $m$ equal the number of men and $d$ equal the number of days to complete the foundation
This implies that $md=k$ for some constant $k$
From the given information, $15\cdot 4=60=k$
Knowing the value of $k$ we can solve for the number of days it would have have taken 25 men to dig the foundation: \begin{align*}
25\cdot d&=60\\
\Rightarrow\qquad d&=60/25=12/5=\boxed{2.4}
\end{align*}
Let the number of attempted three-point shots made be $x$ and the number of attempted two-point shots be $y$
We know that $x+y=30$
We need to evaluate $(0.2\cdot3)x +(0.3\cdot2)y$, as we know that the three-point shots are worth 3 points and that she made $20\%$ of them and that the two-point shots are worth 2 and that she made $30\%$ of them.
Simplifying, we see that this is equal to $0.6x + 0.6y = 0.6(x+y)$
Plugging in $x+y=30$, we get $0.6(30) = \boxed{18}$.
We could cross-multiply, but that doesn't look like much fun
Instead, we first factor the quadratic, which gives us  \[\frac{(t-8)(t+7)}{t-8} = \frac{3}{t+5}.\]Canceling the common factor on the left gives  \[t+7 = \frac{3}{t+5}.\]Multiplying both sides by $t+5$ gives us $(t+7)(t+5) = 3$
Expanding the product on the left gives $t^2 + 12t + 35 = 3$, and rearranging this equation gives $t^2 +12 t + 32 = 0$
Factoring gives $(t+4)(t+8) = 0$, which has solutions $t=-4$ and $t=-8$
The greatest of these solutions is $\boxed{-4}$.
One dozen apples is 12 apples, which costs $2\cdot3=6$ kunks (since 4 apples cost 2 kunks), which costs $5\cdot2=\boxed{10}$ lunks (since 3 kunks cost 5 lunks).
Since she only needs to make the same amount of money, if she works for 3 times as many weeks, she can work 3 times fewer hours per week, meaning she can work $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 36 = \boxed{12}$ hours per week.
Factoring, we have $x^2 - 16x + 60 = (x - 10)(x - 6)$ Therefore, $a = 10$ and $b = 6,$ and $3b - a = 18 - 10 = \boxed{8}.$
Since $4=2^2$, $4^n=2^{2n}$
Since $64=2^6$, $64^{n-36}=2^{6(n-36)}$
$$2^{n+2n}=2^{6(n-36)}\Rightarrow 3n=6n-216$$
So $3n=216\Rightarrow n=\boxed{72}$.
If $n$ is the middle of these integers, then we have $(n-1)^2+n^2+(n+1)^2 = 3n^2+2 = 7805$, or $n^2 = 2601$, meaning that $n=51$
Thus the sum of the cubes is $50^3+51^3+52^3 = \boxed{398259}$.
We know that by definition, $i^2=-1$, so $i^4=(-1)^2=1.$ More generally, for all integers k, $i^{4k}=(i^4)^k=1^k=1$
This means that $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}= i^8(i^3)+i^{16}(1)+i^{20}(i)+i^{24}(i^2)+i^{28}(i^3)=i^3+1+i+i^2+i^3$
Since $i^3=-i$, we can simplify this to get our final result: $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}=-i+1+i-1-i=\boxed{-i}.$
When the denominator is 0, the expression is undefined
Therefore, we set the denominator to 0 and solve: $$a^2-4=(a-2)(a+2)=0.$$ Therefore, the expression is undefined when $a=\boxed{-2, 2}.$
We begin by evaluating (or simplifying) the RHS of the equation
Since $2^4=16$, we know that $\log_2 16=4$, so we have $\log_x 81=4$
Writing this equation in exponential form, we get that $x^4=81$
This gives us the possible solutions $x=\pm3$
However since the base of a logarithm is always positive, $x$ must equal $\boxed{3}$.
We substitute the values for $x$ and $y$ into the expression and get $$\frac{5\left(\frac35\right)+9\left(\frac79\right)}{45\left(\frac35\right)\left(\frac79\right)}=\frac{3+7}{3\cdot7}=\boxed{\frac{10}{21}}.$$
Based on the expansion $(x - \alpha)(x - \beta) = x^2 - (\alpha + \beta)x + \alpha\beta,$ we know that the product of a quadratic formula with leading term of $x^2$ is just the constant term.
In this case, we rearrange the equation given to look like the derived equation above--i.e
$x^2 + 2x - 35 = 0.$ Now, we see that the product of the roots is just $\boxed{-35}.$
We can manually add $3+4+\cdots+12$, or we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series
We multiply the average of the first and last terms $\frac{3+12}{2}$ by the number of terms, $12-3+1=10$
The value of the sum is $\frac{15}{2}\cdot10=15\cdot5=75$, so there are $\boxed{75}$ logs in the stack.
We are looking at the range of $f(x)$ when $x$ is in the interval $[1,\infty)$
Because $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $[1, \infty)$
We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0, but never reaches it
Hence, on the interval $[1,\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values between 0 (exclusive) and 1 inclusive, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{(0,1]}$.
The $x$-intercept occurs when $y=0$
Plugging in we have $4x+7(0)+c=0$, so $4x=-c$ and $x=-\frac{c}{4}$
The $y$-intercept occurs when $x=0$, so we plug in to find $4(0)+7y+c=0$, so $7y=-c$ and $y=-\frac{c}{7}$
We are given that $\left(-\frac{c}{4}\right)+\left(-\frac{c}{7}\right)=22$
We solve for $c$ by multiplying through by a common denominator, which is $28$
This gives $7(-c)+4(-c)=22(28)$, so $-11c=22(28)$
Cancelling a factor of $11$ we have $-c=2(28)=56$, so $c=\boxed{-56}$.
We get rid of the cube root sign by cubing both sides
This gives us $3-x = -\frac{27}{8}$
Solving this equation gives $x = 3 + \frac{27}{8} = \boxed{\frac{51}{8}}$.
Cross-multiplication gives  \[x^2+x+1=(x+2)(x+1)=x^2+3x+2.\]Therefore \[0=2x+1\]and $x=\boxed{-\frac12}$.
Let the sum be $S$
This series looks almost geometric, but not quite
We can turn it into a geometric series as follows: \begin{align*}
S &= \frac{1}{3^1} +\frac{2}{3^2} + \frac{3}{3^3} + \frac{4}{3^4} + \cdots \\
\frac{1}{3}S &= \frac{0}{3^1} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{2}{3^3} + \frac{3}{3^4} + \cdots \\
\frac{2}{3}S = S - \frac{1}{3}S &= \frac{1}{3^1} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{3^3} + \frac{1}{3^4} + \cdots
\end{align*}Now, we do have a geometric series, so we can find $\frac{2}{3}S = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{2}$, and $S = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.
Setting $y$ to 36, we find the following: \begin{align*}
36& = -16t^2 + 80t\\
0 & = -16t^2 + 80t - 36\\
& = 4t^2 - 20t + 9\\
& = (2t - 1)(2t - 9)
\end{align*}Our possible values for $t$ are $\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$ or $\frac{9}{2} = 4.5.$ Of these, we choose the smaller $t$, or $\boxed{0.5}.$
We complete the square.
We have $(x-10)^2 = x^2 - 20x + 100$, and so
\begin{align*}
x^2-20x+ 36 &= (x-10)^2 + (36-100) \\
&= (x-10)^2 - 64.
\end{align*}Therefore, $b=-10$ and $c=-64$, which gives us $b+c = \boxed{-74}$.
Solution 1:
Let $x = \sqrt{15 - 6\sqrt{6}} + \sqrt{15 + 6\sqrt{6}}.$  Then \[x^2 = \left( \sqrt{15 - 6\sqrt{6}} \right)^2 + 2 \sqrt{15 - 6\sqrt{6}} \sqrt{15 + 6\sqrt{6}} + \left( \sqrt{15 + 6\sqrt{6}} \right)^2 \] We observe that $\left( 15 - 6\sqrt{6} \right)\left( 15 + 6\sqrt{6} \right) = 15^2 - \left(6\sqrt{6}\right)^2 = 225 - 216 = 9$ because of difference of squares
So \[x^2 = \left( 15 - 6\sqrt{6} \right) + 2\sqrt{9} + \left( 15 + 6\sqrt{6} \right)\] The $6\sqrt{6}$ terms cancel, and so $x^2 = 36.$  Since $x$ must be positive, then $x = \boxed{6}$ and not $-6$.
Solution 2:
Let $a+b\sqrt{6} = \sqrt{15+6\sqrt{6}}$ for some $a$ and $b$
Squaring, we get $(a^2+6b^2) + 2ab\sqrt{6} = 15 + 6\sqrt{6}$
After some experimentation, we see this is true if $a=3$, $b=1$
So $\sqrt{15+6\sqrt{6}} = 3+\sqrt{6}$
Similarly, we find that $\sqrt{15-6\sqrt{6}} = 3-\sqrt{6}$
So $\sqrt{15-6\sqrt{6}} + \sqrt{15+6\sqrt{6}} = (3-\sqrt{6}) + (3+\sqrt{6}) = \boxed{6}$.
The ratio of their areas is going to be the ratio of their side lengths, but squared
The ratio of the side length of square A to that of B is $\frac{36}{42}=\frac{6}{7}$
Thus, the ratio of their areas is $\left( \frac{6}{7} \right) ^2=\boxed{\frac{36}{49}}$.
Five percent growth corresponds to multiplication by $1+5\%=1.05$
So, the amount of money Frederick will have in $18$ years is $2000(1+.05)^{18}=\boxed{\$4813.24}$.
The first term is 1, and the common difference is 3
Therefore, to get to the $15^\text{th}$ term, we must add 3 to the first term 14 times, to get $1+ 3(14) = \boxed{43}$.
We could do the multiplication, but that would be tedious
Instead, note that $99\times 99 = (100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2\cdot 1\cdot 100 + 1 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = \boxed{9801}$.
Substituting $f^{-1}(x)$ into our expression for $f$ we get  \[f(f^{-1}(x))=3f^{-1}(x)-8.\]Since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f^{-1}$, we have \[x=3f^{-1}(x)-8.\]or  \[f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x+8}3.\]We want to solve the equation $f(x) = f^{-1}(x)$, so \[3x-8=\frac{x+8}3.\]or \[9x-24=x+8.\]Solving for $x$, we find $x = \boxed{4}$.
Subtracting the first given equation from the second equation, we have $2x+y-(x+y)=13-10 \Rightarrow x=3$
Plugging the value of $x$ into the first given equation to solve for $y$, we have $y=10-x=7$
Thus, $x^2-y^2=3^2-7^2=\boxed{-40}$.
We have $|{-34.1}| = 34.1$, so $\lfloor |{-34.1}|\rfloor = \lfloor 34.1\rfloor =\boxed{34}$.
$f(g(2))=f(2^2-6)=f(-2)=-2+3=\boxed{1}$.
We calculate the first several terms directly and find the sequence starts
\[ 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots \] It appears the $n$th term is $2^{n-2}$ for $n\geq 2$
Since $2^{12}=4096$, the first power of 2 that exceeds 5000 is $2^{13}=\boxed{8192}$.
Let's prove by induction that the $n$th term of the sequence is $2^{n-2}$ for all integers $n\geq 2$
The base case $n=2$ holds since the second term of the sequence is the sum of all the terms before it, which is just 1
For the induction step, let $n>2$ and suppose that the $(n-1)$st term is $2^{n-1-2}=2^{n-3}$
Then the sum of the first $n-2$ terms of the sequence is $2^{n-3}$, since the $(n-1)$st term is equal to the sum of the first $n-2$ terms
So the $n$th term, which is defined to be the sum of the first $n-1$ terms, is \[\underbrace{2^{n-3}}_{\text{sum of first }n-2\text{ terms}}+\underbrace{2^{n-3}}_{(n-1)\text{st term}}=2\cdot2^{n-3}=2^{n-2}.\]   This completes the induction step, so the statement is proved for all $n\geq 2$.
Let $d$ denote the number of miles in the distance from $A$ to $B$ and let $r$ denote the speed of the car (in miles per hour) on the return trip
It takes $d/60$ hours to travel from $A$ to $B$ and $d/r$ hours to travel from $B$ to $A$
Round trip, $2d$ miles are covered in $d/60+d/r$ hours for an average speed of  \[
\frac{2d}{\frac{d}{60}+\frac{d}{r}} \cdot \frac{\frac{60}{d}}{\frac{60}{d}} =
\frac{120}{1+\frac{60}{r}}
\] Setting this expression equal to $45$, we find $r=\boxed{36}$.
There are two segments of Brenda's trip: from $(-4,5)$ to $(0,0)$, and from $(0,0)$ to $(5,-4)$
Using the distance formula, the total distance is  \begin{align*}
\sqrt{(-4-0)^2+(5-0)^2}&+\sqrt{(5-0)^2+(-4-0)^2}\\
&=\sqrt{16+25}+\sqrt{25+16}\\
&=\boxed{2\sqrt{41}}.
\end{align*}
We have a geometric sequence with first term 1000 and common ratio $1/2$
Any term in this sequence can be represented as $1000\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k$, where $k$ is the number of bounces (for example, when $k=1$, $1000\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k=500$, or the height of the $k=1^\text{st}$ bounce)
We need to find the smallest $k$ such that $1000\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k<1$
Through trial and error, we find that $k=10$, so it takes $\boxed{10}$ bounces for the maximum height to be less than 1 foot.
We seek the number $n$ such that $\frac{3+n}{5+n} = \frac{5}{6}$
Multiplying both sides by $5+n$ and by 6 gives $(3+n)(6) = 5(5+n)$
Expanding both sides gives $18 + 6n = 25 + 5n$
Simplifying this equation gives $n = \boxed{7}$.
We have  \begin{align*}
&(9x^9+7x^8+4x^7) + (x^{11}+x^9+2x^7+3x^3+5x+8)\\
&=x^{11}+(9+1)x^9+7x^8+(4+2)x^7+3x^3+5x+8\\
&=\boxed{x^{11}+10x^9+7x^8+6x^7+3x^3+5x+8}\\
\end{align*}
Let $a = x + 1$ and $b = 3 - x$
Then, \begin{align*}
(x+1)^2+2(x+1)(3-x)+(3-x)^2 &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\
&= (a + b)^2 \\
&= (x + 1 + 3 - x)^2 \\
&= 4^2 =\boxed{16}.
\end{align*}
Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$
We have the equations \begin{align*}
a+b&=22\\
(b+c)/2=13 \Rightarrow b+c&=26\\
c+d&=30\\
a+c&=26
\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables
We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\boxed{52}$ miles long.
If $f(x)=c$ has $6$ solutions, then the horizontal line $y=c$ intersects the graph of $y=f(x)$ at $6$ points
There are two horizontal grid lines which intersect our graph $6$ times:

These lines are $y=-3,$ $y=-4$
So, the sum of all desired values of $c$ is $(-3)+(-4)=\boxed{-7}$.
Distribute on the left-hand side and add 3 to both sides to obtain $3x^2-7x+3=0$
Since it doesn't factor easily, we use the quadratic formula:  \[
\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a} = \frac{7\pm\sqrt{7^{2}-4 \cdot 3 \cdot 3}}{2\cdot 3} = \frac{7 \pm\sqrt{13}}{6}.
\] Since $7$, $13$, and $6$ are relatively prime, $m=7$, $n=13$, and $p=6$, so $m+n+p=7+13+6=\boxed{26}$.
This is a finite geometric series with first term $\frac{1}{3}$, common ratio $\frac{1}{3}$ and $6$ terms
Therefore the sum is: $$\frac{\frac{1}{3}\left(1-\frac{1}{3^{6}}\right)}{1-\frac{1}{3}}
=\frac{\frac{3^{6}-1}{3^{7}}}{\frac{2}{3}}
= \frac{3^{6}-1}{2\cdot3^{6}}=\frac{729-1}{2\cdot 729} = \boxed{\frac{364}{729}}.$$
We see that \begin{align*}
(x-2)(x+2)(x^2+4) &= (x^2-4)(x^2+4) \\
&= \boxed{x^4-16}
\end{align*}
We have $g(-3) = 3(-3) + 4 = -5$, so $f(g(-3)) = f(-5) = (-5)^2 = \boxed{25}$.
If we substitute $f^{-1}(x)$ into our expression for $f$ we get  \[f(f^{-1}(x))=\frac{2f^{-1}(x)-1}{f^{-1}(x)+5}.\]Since $f^{-1}(f(x))=x$ we get \begin{align*}
\frac{2f^{-1}(x)-1}{f^{-1}(x)+5}&=x \\
\Rightarrow \quad 2f^{-1}(x)-1&=x(f^{-1}(x)+5) \\
\Rightarrow \quad 2f^{-1}(x)-1&=x f^{-1}(x)+5x.
\end{align*}Move the terms involving $f^{-1}(x)$ to the left-hand side and the remaining terms to the right-hand side to get \begin{align*}
2f^{-1}(x)-x f^{-1}(x)&=5x+1 \\
\Rightarrow \quad f^{-1}(x)(2-x)&=5x+1 \\
\Rightarrow \quad f^{-1}(x) &= \frac{5x+1}{-x+2}.
\end{align*}Now we can see that $(a,b,c,d)=(5,1,-1,2)$ for this representation of $f^{-1}(x)$, so $a/c=5/(-1) = \boxed{-5}$.
(Remark: If we want to see that $a/c$ is the same for all representations of $f^{-1}(x)$, it suffices to show that for each such representation, $(a,b,c,d)$ is equal to $(5b,b,-b,2b)$
For this, set $(ax+b)/(cx+d)$ equal to $(5x+1)/(-x+2)$, clear denominators and note that the resulting quadratic polynomials are equal for all values of $x$ except possibly 2 and $-d/c$
This implies that the coefficients are equal, and solving the resulting system of linear equations gives $(a,b,c,d)=(5b,b,-b,2b)$.)
We calculate as follows: \[
|{-3^2+4}|=|{-9+4}|=|{-5}|=\boxed{5}.\] Note that $-3^2=-9$ because our conventions for carrying out operations dictate that exponentiation should be done before negation
Hence $-3^2$ means $-(3^2)$ rather than $(-3)^2$.
We have $55 \times 1212 - 15 \times 1212 = 1212(55-15) = 1212(40) = 4848(10) = \boxed{48480}$.
First, we see that $1+2+3+4+5+6=21$
If a number is the sum of seven or more consecutive positive integers, then the number must be at least $1 + 2 + \dots + 7 = 7 \cdot 8/2 = 28$, so $\boxed{6}$ is the largest number of consecutive integers we can use.
We see that
$$9879=10000-121=100^2-11^2$$Thus,
$$9879=(100-11)(100+11)=89(111)=3*37*89$$So the answer is $\boxed{89}$.
If we look at the smallest possible value for $x$, namely $x=0$, then the expression evaluates to $\sqrt{144}=12$
If we choose $x=144^3$ so that $\sqrt[3]{x}=144$, and then the expression evaluates to $\sqrt{144-144}=0$
Similarly, values of $x$ may be chosen so the expression evaluates to any integer between 0 to 12
For example, if we choose $x=143^3$ so that $\sqrt[3]{x}=143$, the expression evaluates to $\sqrt{144-143}=1$
Thus, there are a total of $12-0+1=\boxed{13}$ values of $x$.
Rewriting both sides with $3$ as the base, we have $81^{2x} = (3^4)^{2x} = 3^{8x}$ and $27^{3x-4} = (3^3)^{3x - 4} = 3^{9x - 12}$, and so our equation is $$3^{8x} = 3^{9x - 12}.$$Then, setting the exponents equal to each other, we obtain $$8x = 9x - 12.$$This yields our solution $\boxed{x = 12}.$
We use the distance formula to find the distance between the two points, which is the side length of the square.
$\sqrt{(3-2)^2+(4-1)^2}=\sqrt{1+9} = \sqrt{10}$
Therefore, the area of the square is $(\sqrt{10})^2 = \boxed{10}$.
We start by finding the prime factorization of 243
We find $243 = 3^5$, so we have $(243)^{\frac35} = (3^5)^{\frac35} = 3^{5\cdot \frac{3}{5}} = 3^3 = \boxed{27}$.
Expanding shows \begin{align*}
&(2x^2 +3x +4)(5x^2 +6x +7) \\
&\qquad= 2x^2(5x^2+6x+7) + 3x(5x^2+6x+7) \\
&\qquad\qquad+4(5x^2+6x+7) \\
& \qquad= 10x^4 +27x^3 +52x^2 +42x+7.
\end{align*}The coefficient of the quadratic term is 52
Instead of expanding the product of the two polynomials we can also observe that the quadratic term in the expansion is obtained by the sum of the terms of the form $(ax^2)(b)$ and $(cx)(dx)$ where $a,b,c,$ and $d$ are constants
In the present case, we obtain the quadratic term from the expansion $2x^2 \cdot 7 + 3x \cdot 6x + 4 \cdot 5x^2 = 52x^2$
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{52}$.
We consider the signs of the two factors for all possible values of $n$.
If $n>2$, then both $n-2$ and $n+4$ are positive, so the product is positive.
If $n=2$, then $n-2=0$, so the product is 0.
If $-4<n<2$, then $n-2<0$ and $n+4>0$, so the product is negative.
If $n=-4$, then the product is 0.
If $n <-4$, then both factors are negative, and the product is positive.
Therefore, only the integers $-3$, $-2$, $-1$, $0$, and $1$ satisfy the inequality, for a total of $\boxed{5}$.
We have  \[\frac{\phantom{o}\frac1y\phantom{o}}{\frac1x} = \frac{1}{y} \cdot \frac{x}{1} = \frac{x}{y} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.\]
We complete the square: \begin{align*}
-5r^2 + 40r - 12 & = (-5r^2 + 40r) - 12\\
&= -5(r^2 - 8r + 16) -12 + 5 \cdot 16\\
&= -5(r - 4)^2 + 68
\end{align*} The maximum value of $-5(r-4)^2$ is $0$, since the square of a real number is never negative
Thus, the maximum value of the expression is $\boxed{68}$.
The given line has slope $-\frac{2}{3}$, so the line perpendicular to this line has slope $-\frac{1}{-2/3} = \boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$.
We proceed as follows: \begin{align*}
6a^2 + 5a + 4 &= 3\\
6a^2 + 5a + 1 &= 0\\
(2a + 1)(3a + 1) &= 0.
\end{align*}This gives us $a = -\frac{1}{2}$ or $a = -\frac{1}{3}.$ Of these, $a = -\frac{1}{2}$ gives the smaller value of $2a + 1 = \boxed{0}.$
Simplifying, we have: \begin{align*}
(1)(2a)(3a^2)(4a^3)(5a^4) &= (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(a)(a^2)(a^3)(a^4) \\
&= 120a^{1+2+3+4} = \boxed{120a^{10}}.
\end{align*}
When using the distributive property for the first time, we add the product of $x+2$ and $x$ to the product of $x+2$ and 5:
\begin{align*}
(x+2)(x+5) &= (x+2) \cdot x + (x+2) \cdot 5\\
&= x(x+2) + 5(x+2)
\end{align*}We use the distributive property again and combine like terms:
\begin{align*}
x(x+2) + 5(x+2) &= x^2 + 2x + 5x+ 10\\
&= \boxed{x^2 + 7x + 10}
\end{align*}
Let $l$ represent the length of the rectangle and $w$ represent the width so that $l = 3x$ and $w = x + 5$
Since the area of the rectangle equals its perimeter, we have that $l \times w = 2l + 2w$
We can then substitute $3x$ back in for $l$ and $x + 5$ in for $w$ to get  \begin{align*}
& (3x)(x+5) = 2(3x) + 2(x + 5) \\
\Rightarrow\qquad & 3x^2 + 15x = 6x + 2x + 10 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad & 3x^2 + 7x - 10 = 0 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad & (x - 1)(3x + 10) = 0.
\end{align*}Solving this equation, we get that the two possible values of $x$ are $x = 1$ and $x = - \frac{10}{3}$
However, both the length $3x$ and the width $x + 5$ must be positive, so the only solution is $x = \boxed{1}$.
We have $6 \# 2 = 6+\frac{6}{2} = 6+3 = \boxed{9}$.
Let's work with this problem in cents, not dollars, because the answer calls for a number in cents
So, Uri's two burgers and a soda cost 210 cents and Gen's food costs 240 cents
Let a burger cost $b$ cents and a soda cost $s$ cents
We are trying to find the value of $s$
We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information
These equations are:
\begin{align*}
2b + s &= 210 \\
b + 2s &= 240 \\
\end{align*}
We are solving for $s$, so we want to eliminate $b$ from the equations above
Multiplying both sides of the second equation by 2, we get $2b+4s = 480$, or $2b = 480 - 4s$
Substituting this equation into the first equation above to eliminate $b$, we get that $(480 - 4s) + s = 210$, or $s=90$
Thus, a soda costs $\boxed{90}$ cents.
We start by completing the square: \begin{align*}
-x^2 -6x +12 &= -(x^2 + 6x) + 12\\ &= -(x^2 + 6x + (6/2)^2 - (6/2)^2) + 12\\ &= -((x+3)^2 -3^2) + 12 \\&= -(x+3)^2 +3^2 + 12 \\&= -(x+3)^2 + 21.\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is at least 0, we have $(x+3)^2\ge 0$, so $-(x+3)^2 \le 0$
Therefore, $-(x+3)^2 + 21$ is at most 21
Since $(x+3)^2 =0$ when $x=-3$, this maximum of $21$ is achieved when $x= \boxed{-3}$.
We start from the inside and work our way out: $$f(-1)=(-1)^2-2(-1)=3.$$ Therefore $$f(f(f(f(f(f(-1))))))=f(f(f(f(f(3)))).$$ Now $f(3)=3^2-2\cdot3=3$
We can use that fact repeatedly to conclude  \begin{align*}
f(f(f(f(f(f(-1))))))&=f(f(f(f(f(3))))\\
&=f(f(f(f(3)))\\
& \vdots\\ &= f(3)=\boxed{3}.\end{align*}
Since the maximum value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is 5, which occurs at $x = 3$, this tells us that the vertex of the parabola is $(3,5)$
Hence, the quadratic is of the form $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, where $a$ is a negative number
(We know that $a$ is negative because $y$ has a maximum value.)
We are also told that the graph passes through the point $(0,-13)$
Substituting these coordinates into the equation $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, we get $-13 = 9a + 5$, so $a = (-5 - 13)/9 = -18/9 = -2$
Therefore, the equation is $y =- 2(x - 3)^2+5$.
When $x = 4$, we have $m = - 2 \cdot 1^2 + 5 = \boxed{3}$.
This equation is solved by \[h(x)=(5x^2-6x-1)-(3x^4+2x-1)=\boxed{-3x^4+5x^2-8x}\]
The ball traveled $16+16\cdot\frac34+16\cdot\left(\frac34\right)^2 = 16+ 12+9 = 37$ meters on its three descents
The ball also traveled $16\cdot\frac34+16\cdot\left(\frac34\right)^2+16\cdot\left(\frac34\right)^3 = 12+9+\frac{27}4 = 27.75$ meters on its three ascents
Thus, the ball traveled $37+27.75 = 64.75 \approx \boxed{65}$ meters total.
Because $\sqrt{16}<\sqrt{17}<\sqrt{25}$, or, $4<\sqrt{17}<5$, the largest integer less than $\sqrt{17}$ is $4$
Therefore, $4^2=\boxed{16}$.
We can see that $\delta(\phi(x)) = 3(8x + 7) + 8 = 24x + 29.$ Therefore, we have that $24x + 29 = 7$, giving us $24x = -22.$ Therefore, $x = \boxed{-\dfrac{11}{12}}.$
There are three denominators in the formula for $f(x)$: $$x, \quad 1+\frac 1x, \quad 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac 1x}.$$ For $f(x)$ to be undefined, one of these denominators must be $0$
We go through them one by one.
The simplest denominator, $x$, is $0$ if $x=0$.
The second denominator, $1+\frac 1x$, is $0$ if $x=-1$.
The third denominator, $1+\frac{1}{1+\frac 1x}$, is $0$ if $$\frac{1}{1+\frac 1x} = -1.$$ We can solve like this: \begin{align*}
-1 &= 1+\frac 1x \\
-2 &= \frac 1x \\
x &= -\frac 12
\end{align*}
Thus, the sum of the three points not in the domain of $f(x)$ is $0+(-1)+\left(-\frac 12\right) = \boxed{-\frac 32}$.
The fourth term in the sequence is $3^0+3^1+3^2+3^3 = 1+3+9+27 = \boxed{40}$.
Since $a^2$ and $\sqrt{b}$ are inversely proportional, $a^2\sqrt{b}=k$ for some constant k
Thus $k=2^2 \sqrt{81} = 36$
Squaring both sides gives $a^4\cdot b=1296$, so if $ab=48$ then dividing those two equations gives $a^3=\frac{1296}{48}=27$, so $a=3$ and $b=\frac{48}{3}=\boxed{16}$.
We want to sum the arithmetic series $11 + 13 + \cdots + 39$, which has common difference 2
Suppose the series has $n$ terms
39 is the $n$th term, so $39 = 11 + (n-1)\cdot2$
Solving, we get $n = 15$.The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(11 + 39)/2 \cdot 15 = \boxed{375}$.
We have $\frac{3}{x} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} - \frac26 =\frac16$
Cross-multiplying $\frac3x =\frac16$ gives $x = \boxed{18}$.
To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$
We will do this by completing the square
Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \[-16t^2+80t+21=-16(t^2-5t)+21\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-5/2)^2=6.25$ inside the parenthesis to get \begin{align*}
-16(t^2-5t)+21&=-16(t^2-5t+6.25-6.25)+21\\
&=-16([t-2.5]^2-6.25)+21\\
&=-16(t-2.5)^2+121
\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2.5)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2.5)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+121=\boxed{121}$ feet.
Expanding the first given equation using the distributive property, we have \begin{align*}
25&=(x+y+z)(xy+xz+yz)\\&=x(xy+xz+yz)+y(xy+xz+yz)+z(xy+xz+yz)\\
&=x^2y+x^2z+xyz+xy^2+xyz+y^2z+xyz+xz^2+yz^2\\
&=3xyz+x^2y+x^2z+xy^2+y^2z+xz^2+yz^2
\end{align*}Expanding the second given equation using the distributive property, we have \begin{align*}
7&=x^2(y+z)+y^2(x+z)+z^2(x+y)\\
&=x^2y+x^2z+xy^2+y^2z+xz^2+yz^2.\end{align*}We substitute the equation $$7=x^2y+x^2z+xy^2+y^2z+xz^2+yz^2$$into the expanded form of the first given equation to get \[25=3xyz+7\]or $xyz=\boxed{6}$.
Taking the square root of both sides, $2008+x=\pm x.$ There are no solutions when the right hand side equals $x$ (the result is $2008=0$), so we consider $2008+x=-x.$ Solving, $x=\boxed{-1004}.$
We are trying to find the day of the month on which the pond was $75\%$ algae-free, or the day when the pond was $25\%$ covered
On day $30$ of the month the pond was completely covered, and the amount of algae doubled every day
This means that on day $29$, the pond was half covered in algae, and therefore on day $\boxed{28}$ the pond was $25\%$ covered in algae.
We have $12 \star 3 = 12+ \frac{12}{3}=12+4=\boxed{16}$.
If the quadratic expression on the left side has exactly one root in $x$, then it must be a perfect square
Dividing 9 from both sides, we have $x^2+\frac{n}{9}x+\frac{1}{9}=0$
In order for the left side to be a perfect square, it must factor to either $\left(x+\frac{1}{3}\right)^2=x^2+\frac{2}{3}x+\frac{1}{9}$ or $\left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)^2=x^2-\frac{2}{3}x+\frac{1}{9}$ (since the leading coefficient and the constant term are already defined)
Only the first case gives a positive value of $n$, which is $n=\frac{2}{3}\cdot9=\boxed{6}$.
Suppose that the airplane has $s$ seats
Then we have that $24 + 0.25 s + \frac{2}{3} s = s$
Solving, we find that $s = \boxed{288}$.
Moving terms to the LHS, we have $x^2-2x+y^2-4y=-1$
Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(2/2)^2=1$ to both sides
Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(4/2)^2=4$ to both sides
We are left with the equation $x^2-2x+1+y^2-4y+4=4 \Rightarrow (x-1)^2+(y-2)^2=4$
Thus, our circle has center $(1,2)$
The distance between this center and the point $(13,7)$ is $\sqrt{(13-1)^2+(7-2)^2}=\boxed{13}$.
The number of workers will be inversely proportional to the time needed to complete the job
This means that the product $(\text{number of workers})\times(\text{days to complete job})$ will be a constant
In this case, that constant will be: $$4\times 1.25=5$$ For three workers, the product will remain the same
Let $D$ equal the number of days needed for three workers to complete the job
Then, \begin{align*}
3\times D&=5\\
\Rightarrow\qquad D&=5/3=\boxed{1\frac{2}{3}} \text{work-days}.
\end{align*}
Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this polynomial
Therefore, $r_1+r_2=13$ and $r_1r_2=4$
Notice that the sum of the reciprocals of the roots can be obtained by dividing the first equation by the second equation: $\frac{r_1+r_2}{r_1r_2}=\frac{1}{r_1}+\frac{1}{r_2}=\boxed{\frac{13}{4}}$.
The constant term of the product of two polynomials is just the product of the two constant terms
Therefore we know that $-16=-8g$, so $g=2$
We now consider the linear term of the product of our polynomials
It's given by $14d=(-3d\cdot-8)+g\cdot hd\Longrightarrow14d=24d+(2)hd\Longrightarrow h=-5$
Therefore our answer is $g+h=2+(-5)=\boxed{-3}$.
Recall that $a^2 - b^2$ can be factored as $(a+b)(a-b)$
Thus $55^2 - 45^2 = (55+45)(55-45) = (100)(10) = \boxed{1000}$.
The greatest common factor of the two coefficients is $11$, and the greatest power of $z$ that divides both terms is $z^{17}$
So, we factor $11z^{17}$ out of both terms:
\begin{align*}
55z^{17}+121z^{34} &= 11z^{17}\cdot 5 +11z^{17}\cdot 11z^{17}\\
&= \boxed{11z^{17}(5+11z^{17})}
\end{align*}
The expression is only undefined when the denominator is equal to zero
Therefore, the goal is to find the product of all real $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2+2x-3=0$
Since the discriminant of this quadratic is $2^2 - 4(1)(-3) = 16$, which is positive, we know that the roots of $x^2 +2x-3$ are distinct real numbers
The product of the roots of a quadratic of the form of $ax^2+bx+c$ is equal to $\frac{c}{a}$, so the desired product of the values of $x$ for which $x^2 + 2x - 3=0$ is $\frac{-3}{1}$, or $\boxed{-3}$.
Since Jenny ate $20\%$ of the jellybeans remaining each day, $80\%$ of the jellybeans are left at the end of each day
If $x$ is the number of jellybeans in the jar originally, then $(0.8)^2x=32$
Thus $x=\boxed{50}$.
We are trying to find the range of the function $s(r(x))$
This means we take a number, input it into $r(x)$, take the output and use it as the input for $s(x)$, and find the output
We know that the domain of $s(x)$ is $\{1,2,3,4\}$, so for $s(r(x))$ to be defined, $r(x)$ must be one of the values $1, 2, 3, 4$
The possible values of $r(x)$ are the range of $r(x)$, which is $\{0,2,4,6\}$
The intersection of these two sets is $\{2,4\}$, so only $2$ or $4$ can be the output of $r(x)$ and thus the input of $s(x)$ in the function $s(r(x))$
So the possible outputs from $s(x)$ are $2+1=3$ and $4+1=5$
Thus the sum of all possible outputs is $3+5=\boxed{8}$.
We have $8\odot 6 = 8+\frac{3(8)}{2(6)}=8+2=\boxed{10}$.
Setting $y$ to 28, we find the following: \begin{align*}
28& = -4.9t^2 + 23.8t\\
0 & = -4.9t^2 + 23.8t - 28\\
0 & = 49t^2 - 238t + 280\\
& = 7t^2 - 34t + 40\\
& = (7t - 20)(t - 2)
\end{align*}Our possible values for $t$ are $\frac{20}{7} \approx 2.857$ or $2.$ Of these, we choose the smaller $t$, or $\boxed{2}.$
Anisha begins with the integer $10^6=(2^6)(5^6)$
After 12 steps, every factor of 2 is removed and replaced with a factor of $5$, so what remains is $5^6\cdot 5^6=\boxed{5^{12}}$.
Case 1: $n+6 \ge 0$ $$|n + 6| = n + 6 = 2 - n.$$Solve for $n$: $2n=-4,$ so we have $n =-2$.
Case 2: $n+6 \le 0$ $$|n + 6| = - n - 6 = 2 - n.$$Then we get $-6 = 2,$ which means that there are no solutions in this case.
Therefore, $n$ must be $\boxed{-2}.$
We have $x^5 - 5x = 4^5 - 5(4) = 1024 - 20 = \boxed{1004}$.
Note that $\frac{2n-4}{2-n} = \frac{2(n-2)}{-(n-2)}=-2$
From this, we can rewrite the given equation and solve: \begin{align*}
\frac{2-n}{n+1}-2&=1\\
\Rightarrow \qquad \frac{2-n}{n+1}&=3\\
\Rightarrow \qquad 2-n&=3n+3\\
\Rightarrow \qquad -1&=4n\\
\Rightarrow \qquad \boxed{-\frac{1}{4}}&=n
\end{align*}
There are five 3-minute increments between 3:00 pm and 3:15 pm, so the bacteria doubles 5 times, so the final population is $2^5 = 32$ times the initial population
Hence at 3:15 pm there are $20 \cdot 32 = \boxed{640}$ bacteria.
Since $|f(x)| \le 5$ for all $x$ and $|g(x)| \le 2$ for all $x$, $|f(x) g(x)| \le 10$ for all $x$
It follows that $f(x) g(x) \le 10$ for all $x$, so $b$ is at most 10.
Furthermore, if $f$ is any function such that the range of $f$ is $[-5,3]$ and $f(0) = -5$, and $g$ is any function such the range of $g$ is $[-2,1]$ and $g(0) = -2$, then $f(0) g(0) = (-5) \cdot (-2) = 10$
Therefore, the largest possible value of $b$ is $\boxed{10}$.
We use the distance formula: $$\sqrt{(8 - 0)^2 + (0 - 15)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 225} = \boxed {17}.$$- OR -
We note that the points $(0, 15)$, $(8, 0)$, and $(0, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 8 and 15
This is a Pythagorean triple, so the hypotenuse must have length $\boxed{17}$.
Using the distributive property and combining like terms: \begin{align*}
x(3x^2-2)-5(x^2-2x+7) &= 3x^3-2x-5x^2+10x-35\\
& = \boxed{3x^3-5x^2+8x-35}.
\end{align*}
If the number is $x$, we can set up the equation $\frac{16}{x}=\frac{64}{100}$
We divide both sides by $4$ to get $\frac{1}{x}=\frac{4}{100}=\frac{1}{25}$, so $x=\boxed{25}$.
To do this problem rigorously, simply note that if $n$ is your number, the sum of it and its square is: $n^2 + n = n(n+1) = 156$
Factoring 156 yields a prime factor of 13, and normally you'd have to check other combinations of factors, but the factoring out of 13 conveniently leaves 12 as the product of the other factors, which yields $n = \boxed{12}$.
We can also solve it as a quadratic equation
$n^2 + n = 156$ becomes $n^2 + n - 156 = 0$
Factoring, we find that $(n - 12)(n + 13) = 0.$ This gives us $n = 12$ or $n = -13,$ but $n$ must be positive, so $n = \boxed{12}$.
However, in the countdown round, you're going to need to do this quickly, and the quickest way to do this (if you have the first 20 or so squares memorized) is to think of which squares are closest to 156 (since adding by the number itself is small compared to the magnitude of squaring), and then note that $13^2$ is too large by a little bit (169), at which point you should simply instinctively guess $\boxed{12}$, because $12^2$ is less than 156, and that $11^2$ should be way too small ($121+11 = 132$).
We have  \[x^2 y^3 z = \left(\frac13\right)^2 \left(\frac23\right)^3(-9) = \frac{1}{9}\cdot \frac{8}{27}\cdot (-9) = -\frac{8}{27}\left(\frac19\cdot 9\right) = \boxed{-\frac{8}{27}}.\]
If $f(2)=5$ and $f(3)=4$, then $f^{-1}(5)=2$ and $f^{-1}(4)=3$, respectively
Therefore, $f^{-1}\left(f^{-1}(5)+f^{-1}(4)\right)=f^{-1}\left(2+3\right)=f^{-1}(5) = \boxed{2}$.
First, we find all $x$ such that $f(x) = 2$ by drawing the line $y = 2$ and finding the intersection points.

Thus, $f(x) = 2$ for $x = -3$, $x = 0$, and $x = 3$
So, if $f(f(x)) = 2$, then $f(x) = -3$ ,$f(x) = 0$, or $f(x) = 3$.
Since $f(x) \ge 0$ for all $x$ ,the equation $f(x) = -3$ has no solutions.
We see that $f(x) = 0$ for $x = -4$.
And the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y = 3$ intersect at $x = -2$, and once between $x = 3$ and $x = 4$ at the red dot
This means the equation $f(x) = 3$ has two solutions.

First, we factor out the constants of the squared terms to get $9(x^2-2x)+9(y^2+4y)=-44.$
To complete the square, we need to add $\left(\dfrac{2}{2}\right)^2=1$ after the $-2x$ and $\left(\dfrac{4}{2}\right)^2=4$ after the $4y,$ giving $$9(x-1)^2+9(y+2)^2=-44+9+36=1.$$ Dividing the equation by $9$ gives $$(x-1)^2+(y+2)^2=\frac{1}{9},$$ so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{9}}=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}.$
Subtract 1/3 from 1/2 by finding a common denominator: \[
\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}=\frac{3}{6}-\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{6}.
\] Solving $\frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{x}$ we find $x=\boxed{6}$.
Add $(-2/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the first equation and $(-8/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the second equation to find that the given equations are equivalent to \begin{align*}
(x^2-2x+1)+(y^2-10y+25)&=1\text{, and} \\
(x^2-8x+16)+(y^2-10y+25)&=4
\end{align*} which are equivalent to \begin{align*}
(x-1)^2+(y-5)^2 &=1^2, \\
(x-4)^2+(y-5)^2 &=2^2,
\end{align*} respectively
Hence, the two circles have centers $(1,5)$ and $(4,5)$ respectively and radii $1$ and $2$ respectively
Since the centers of the circles are $3$ units apart and the sum of their radii is $3$, the two circles intersect at only one point
We can see that $(2,5)$ is the desired intersection point, so our product is $2 \cdot 5 =\boxed{10}$.
We see that $12y^2-65y+42=(3y-14)(4y-3)$, thus $A = 3$ and $B = 4$
Hence, $AB + A = \boxed{15}.$
Let $M$ and $J$ be the ages of Mickey and Jerry, respectively
Then, $300\%$ of Jerry's age is $3J$
Since Mickey's age is 4 years less than $300\%$ of Jerry's age, we have $M=3J - 4$
We are given that $M = 14$, so $14 = 3J-4$
Adding 4 to both sides gives $18 = 3J$, so $J=6$ and Jerry is $\boxed{6}$ years old.
Note that $a * b = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a + b}{ab}$
We are given that $a + b = 9$ and $ab = 20$
If we substitute these values into $\frac{a + b}{ab}$, we can see that $a * b = \boxed{\frac{9}{20}}$.
The distance from a point $(x,y)$ to the origin is $$\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2} = \!\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.$$Evaluating this for each of the five given points, we find that $\boxed{(6,0)}$ is farthest from the origin.
We compute
$$2Z6=6+10(2)-2^2=\boxed{22}$$
We are given that $x^2 - y^2 = 133$, which is the same as $(x+y)(x-y) = 133$
$133$ has two pairs of factors: 1 and 133, and 7 and 19
So, either $x+y = 133$ and $x-y = 1$, or $x+y = 19$ and $x-y = 7$
It is clear that $x$ and $y$ will be much larger in the first case, because they must sum to 133, so, because we are trying to minimize $x^2 + y^2$, we can simply consider the second case
Through simple algebra, we find that $x = 13$ and $y = 6$
Thus, $x^2 + y^2$ is minimized as $169 + 36 = \boxed{205}$.
We can square $x + 4$ to get $x^2 + 8x + 16$, so the given equation becomes $x^2 + 8x - 1 = (x^2 + 8x + 16) - 16 - 1 = (x + 4)^2 - 17 = 0$, which means $(x + 4)^2 = 17$
We see that $b = \boxed{17}$.
We have: $4 > \sqrt{x} > 2$
Squaring, we get $16 > x > 4$
Thus, the integers from 15 to 5, inclusive, satisfy this inequality
That's a total of $15-5+1=\boxed{11}$ integers.
First, we see that $0$ does not satisfy the inequality, so we can divide by $x$
If $x$ is positive, we can divide to get $x<7$, and there are $6$ positive integers satisfying this
If $x$ is negative, we divide to get $x>7$, which is not satisfied by any negative integers
So the number of integer solutions is $\boxed{6}$.
First we distribute the constants in $4(x^2-2x+2)-7(x^3-3x+1)$ to get $4x^2-8x+8-7x^3+21x-7.$ Combining like terms, we find that this is $-7x^3+4x^2+13x+1.$ Then, the sum of the squares of all the coefficients is $(-7)^2 + (4)^2 + (13)^2 + (1)^2 = 49 + 16 + 169 + 1 = \boxed{235}.$
We have \[0.\overline{73} = \frac{73}{100} + \frac{73}{10000} + \frac{73}{1000000} + \cdots.\]This infinite geometric series has first term $73/100$ and common ratio $1/100$, so we have \[0.\overline{73} = \frac{73/100}{1-1/100} = \boxed{\frac{73}{99}}.\]
First, let $A = $ Addison's age, $B = $ Brenda's age, and $J = $ Janet's age
Then, from the statements given, we have the following system of equations:  $$\begin{cases}
A=3B \\
J = B+6 \\
\end{cases} $$ Since $A=J$, we know that $3B=B+6$
Solving this equation, we have that $2B = 6 \Rightarrow B=3$
Thus, Brenda is $\boxed{3}$ years old.
The only values of $x$ that would make this fraction undefined are values that makes the denominator $0$
Therefore, the fraction is undefined when $x+27=0$, or when $x=-27$
Hence, the solution is $\boxed{(-\infty,-27)\cup(-27,\infty)}$.
Mary walks a total of 2 km in 40 minutes
Because 40 minutes is 2/3  hr, her average speed, in km/hr, is  $\dfrac{2\text{ km}}{2/3\text{ hr}} = \boxed{3}\text{ km/hr}.$
Rewrite $\underline{3\Theta}+\Theta$ as $30+\Theta+\Theta=30+2\Theta$, so we have an algebraic expression we can manipulate
Multiply by $\Theta$ to obtain: \begin{align*}
252/\Theta&=30+2\Theta\quad\Rightarrow\\
252&=30\Theta+2\Theta^2\quad\Rightarrow\\
0&=2\Theta^2+30\Theta-252\quad\Rightarrow\\
0&=\Theta^2+15\Theta-126\quad\Rightarrow\\
0&=(\Theta+21)(\Theta-6).
\end{align*}Or using the quadratic formula: \begin{align*}
\Theta&=\frac{-15\pm\sqrt{225-4\cdot1\cdot-126}}{2}\quad\Rightarrow\\
&=\frac{-15\pm\sqrt{729}}{2}\quad\Rightarrow\\
&=\frac{-15\pm27}{2}
\end{align*}Either way, because $\Theta$ must be a positive digit, $\Theta=\boxed{6}$.
Since the perimeter is 40, the sides of the rectangle add up to $40/2 = 20.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle
Then the other side length is $20 - x,$ so the area is
\[x(20 - x) = 20x - x^2.\]Completing the square, we get
\[-x^2 + 20x = -x^2 + 20x - 100 + 100 = 100 - (x - 10)^2.\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\boxed{100}$ square feet, which occurs for a $10 \times 10$ square.
We begin by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, in order to isolate the absolute value
This gives us $|4x|=35-3=32$, which we can split into two separate cases: $4x=32$ and $4x=-32$
For the first case, solving for $x$ would give us $x=\frac{32}{4}=8$
For the second case, we would get $x=-\frac{32}{4}=-8$
Therefore, the two values of $x$ that satisfy the initial equation are $x=8$ and $x=-8$
Since the problem asks for the product of these values, our solution is $(8)(-8)=\boxed{-64}$.
Seeing pairwise products, we consider  \[
(a+b+c+d)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+2(ab+ac+ad+bc+bd+cd),
\]so \[
ab+bc+cd+da=\frac{(a+b+c+d)^2-a^2-b^2-c^2-d^2}{2}-(ac+bd).
\]Since the fraction on the right-hand side does not depend on how the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are assigned, we maximize $ab+bc+cd+da$ by minimizing $ac+bd$
Checking the three distinct values for $ac+bd$, we find that $1\cdot4+2\cdot3=10$ is its minimum value
Therefore, the largest possible value of $ab+bc+cd+da$ is $$\frac{(1+2+3+4)^2-1^2-2^2-3^2-4^2}{2}-10=\boxed{25}.$$
We have  \[(\sqrt{5})^4 = (5^{\frac12})^4 = 5 ^{\frac12\cdot 4} = 5^2 = \boxed{25}.\]
We have $10^2=100$, so $10$ is the smallest positive integer which satisfies the inequalities
From here, we can compute the next few perfect squares: \begin{align*}
11^2 &= 121, \\
12^2 &= 144, \\
13^2 &= 169, \\
14^2 &= 196, \\
15^2 &= 225.
\end{align*} The last $x$ for which $x^2\le 200$ is $x=14$
In all, our solutions in positive integers are $$x=10,11,12,13,14,$$ so there are $\boxed{5}$ such $x$.
The slope of the line containing $(4, -7)$ and $(-5, -1)$ is $\frac{-7 - (-1)}{4 - (-5)}=\frac{-6}{9} = -\frac{2}{3}$
Since the other line is perpendicular to this one its slope is the negative reciprocal of $-\frac{2}{3}$, giving us $\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$.
The midpoints of the diagonals of a rectangle coincide, so the midpoint of the line segment joining $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ is also the midpoint of the line segment joining the other two vertices of the rectangle
The $y$-coordinate of a midpoint equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the two endpoints
Therefore, the average of the $y$-coordinates of $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices
Since the sum is twice the average, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices is the same as that of the given vertices: $17+(-4)=\boxed{13}$.
We have $\frac{7}{12}\dagger\frac{8}{3}=(7)(8)\left(\frac{3}{12}\right)=(7)(2)=\boxed{14}$.
Expanding the left hand side of the given equation, we have $6x^2-17x-45=0$
Since for a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the solutions is $-b/a$, the sum of the solutions of the given equation is $-\frac{-17}{6}=\boxed{\frac{17}{6}}$
(We also could have simply noted that the roots are $-5/3$ and $9/2$, and added these, but who likes adding fractions?)
Substituting $f^{-1}(x)$ into our expression for $f$ we get  \[f(f^{-1}(x))=2f^{-1}(x)-5.\]Since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f^{-1}$, we have \[x=2f^{-1}(x)-5.\]or  \[f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x+5}2.\]We want to solve the equation $f(x) = f^{-1}(x)$, so \[2x-5=\frac{x+5}2.\]or \[4x-10=x+5.\]Solving for $x$, we find $x = \boxed{5}$.
Let the integers be $x$ and $y$ with $x>y$
We have the equations \begin{align*}
x-y&=12\\
xy&=45
\end{align*}Squaring the first equation, we get  \[(x-y)^2=12^2\Rightarrow x^2-2xy+y^2=144\]Multiplying the second equation by four, we get $4xy = 4\cdot45=180$
Adding these last two equations, we have \[x^2-2xy+y^2+4xy=144+180 \Rightarrow (x+y)^2=324 \Rightarrow x+y = 18\]In the last step, we take the positive square root because both $x$ and $y$ are given to be positive
The sum of the two integers is $\boxed{18}$.
As long as $y$ is not an integer, we can define $\lceil{y}\rceil$ as $x$ and $\lfloor{y}\rfloor$ as $x-1$
If we plug these expressions into the given equation, we get  \begin{align*} x(x-1)&=110
\\\Rightarrow\qquad x^2-x&=110
\\\Rightarrow\qquad x^2-x-110&=0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (x-11)(x+10)&=0
\end{align*}This yields $x=11$ and $x=-10$ as two possible values of $x$
However since the problem states that $y<0$ and $x=\lceil{y}\rceil$, $x$ cannot be a positive integer
This allows us to eliminate $11$, leaving the $-10$ as the only possible value of $x$
Since $x=\lceil{y}\rceil=-10$, and $x-1=\lfloor{y}\rfloor=-11$, $y$ must be between the integers $-10$ and $-11$
Therefore, our final answer is $-11<y<-10,$ or $y \in \boxed{(-11, -10)}$ in interval notation.
We use the distance formula: $\sqrt{(-6 - 2)^2 + (-1 - 5)^2},$ so then we find that $\sqrt{64 + 36} = \boxed{10}$.
- OR -
We note that the points $(2, 5)$, $(-6, -1)$, and $(2, -1)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 6 and 8
This is a Pythagorean triple, so the length of the hypotenuse must be $\boxed{10}$.
Let $x$ be the number of cookies that Lee can make with three cups of flour
We can set up the proportion $\frac{18}{2} = \frac{x}{3}$
Solving for $x$, we find that $x = \boxed{27}$.
Moving all the terms to the LHS, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$
Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides
Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides
We have the equation  \[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\]Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$
Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\pm \sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$
Since $\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a negative sign in front of the square root
Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root
In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$
Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$
At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=-\sqrt{625}+24=-1$
Thus, the minimum $y$ value is $\boxed{-1}$.
--OR--
Similar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$
This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\sqrt{625}=25$
The minimum value of $y$ is achieved at the point on the bottom of the circle, which is located at $(7,24-25)=(7,-1)$
Thus, the minimum value of $y$ is $\boxed{-1}$.
Because the 6 empty chairs are $\frac{1}{4}$ of the chairs in the room, there are $6\times 4=24$ chairs in all
The number of seated people is $\frac{3}{4}\times24=18$, and this is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the people present
It follows that \[\frac{18}{\textrm{people present}}=\frac{2}{3}.\]So there are $\boxed{27}$ people in the room.
The quadratic formula yields \[x=\frac{-(a+8)\pm \sqrt{(a+8)^2-4\cdot 4\cdot 9}}{2\cdot 4}
\]The equation has only one solution precisely when the value of the discriminant, $(a+8)^2-144$, is 0
This implies that $a=-20$ or $a=4$, and the sum is $\boxed{-16}$.
\[1017^2=(10^3+17)^2=10^6+2\cdot17\cdot10^3+289=\boxed{1034289}.\]
$5@3=5\cdot3-2\cdot5=5$ and $3@5=3\cdot5-2\cdot3=9$, so $(5@3)-(3@5)=5-9=\boxed{-4}$
Another way to solve this problem is to realize that the expression $(5@3)-(3@5)$ is of the form $(x@y)-(y@x)=xy-2x-yx+2y=-2x+2y$, so the expression is just equal to $-2\cdot5+2\cdot3=\boxed{-4}$.
Using the distance formula, we get that the distance is $$\sqrt{ (1-7)^2 + (-1-7)^2} = \sqrt{36+64} = \sqrt{100} = \boxed{10}.$$
We can simply plug in $16^{\frac{1}{2}}=4$ and $625^{\frac{1}{2}}=25$ and get $4-25=-21$
Alternatively, recognizing the problem as a difference of squares, we can rewrite it as \begin{align*}
(16^{\frac{1}{4}})^2-(625^{\frac{1}{4}})^2&=(16^{\frac{1}{4}}-625^{\frac{1}{4}})(16^{\frac{1}{4}}+625^{\frac{1}{4}}) \\
&=(2-5)(2+5)\\
&=(-3)(7)=\boxed{-21}.
\end{align*}
We solve for $y$ in terms of $x$: \[y = \frac{100 - 5x}{3}.\] Then we express $xy$ in terms of $x$: \[xy = x\frac{100 - 5x}{3} = \frac{100x - 5x^2}{3} = -\frac{5}{3}x^2 + \frac{100}{3}x.\] The graph of this expression is a parabola facing downwards
The greatest possible value of $xy$ occurs at the vertex of this parabola, which occurs when $x = \frac{-100/3}{2\cdot -5/3} = 10$
Then,  \[xy = 10\cdot \frac{50}{3} = \frac{500}{3}.\]   However, this is not an integer
So, we test the two closest integer values of $x$: $x=9$ and $x=11$, to see if either of these yield integer values for $y$.
When $x=9$, $y=\frac{55}{3}$, which is not an integer
When $x=11$, $y=\frac{45}{3}=15$, which is an integer
In this case, \[xy = 11\cdot 15 = \boxed{165}.\]
Applying the difference of squares factorization individually to the first pair of terms and the last pair of terms, we have  \begin{align*}
1003^2&-997^2-1001^2+999^2\\
&= (1003+997)(1003-997)-(1001+999)(1001-999) \\
&= 2000(6)-2000(2) \\
&= \boxed{8000}.
\end{align*}
Let's write the entire equation in smaller bases
We have $${(2^2\cdot3)}^3=\frac{(3^2)^2}3\cdot2^{12p}$$Then, using laws of exponents, we have $$2^6\cdot3^3=\frac{3^4}3\cdot2^{12p},$$which means $$2^6\cdot 3^3 = 3^3 \cdot 2^{12p}.$$Dividing both sides by $3^3$, we have $$2^6=2^{12p}.$$Therefore, we have $12p = 6$, which means $p = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
For a quadratic to have only one solution, the discriminant must be 0
Therefore, we have the equation $20^2-4 \cdot a \cdot 7=0$
Solving, we get $400-28a=0$
Therefore, $a=\frac{400}{28}=\frac{100}{7}$.
Using the quadratic formula, $ \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a} $, we get the solution $ \frac{-20\pm\sqrt{0}}{2 \cdot \frac{100}{7}} = -20 \cdot \frac{7}{200} = \boxed{-\frac{7}{10}}$.
We have $4^3=64$, so $\log_4 64 = \boxed{3}$.
We let the numerator be $x$, so the denominator is $3x-7$
Because the fraction equals $2/5$, we have $x/(3x-7) = 2/5$
Multiplying both sides by $5(3x-7)$ (or cross-multiplying) gives $5x = 2(3x-7)$
Expanding the right side gives $5x = 6x - 14$
Subtracting $6x$ from both sides gives $-x = -14$, so we find $x = \boxed{14}$.
Since $|x-2|$ is an integer, it can equal 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
If $|x-2| = 0$, we have only one solution for $x$
Otherwise we have 2
This leads to a total of $\boxed{11}$ integers in the solution set.
First we begin by solving the system of equations \begin{align*}
9s+5t&=108, \\
t-2&=s.
\end{align*}Making the substitution for $s$ from the second equation to the first, we get $9(t-2)+5t=108$, which simplifies to $14t-18=108$
Solving for $t$, we find that $t=\frac{108+18}{14}=\boxed{9}$.
Writing everything in terms of prime factorizations, the given expression is $\sqrt{3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 7 \cdot x^3} = \sqrt{(2^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot x^2) \cdot (3 \cdot 7 \cdot x)} = \boxed{10x \sqrt{21x}}$.
Let point $B$ have coordinates $(x,y)$
We have the equations $(x+8)/2=4$ and $(y+4)/2=4$, or $x=0$ and $y=4$
Thus, the sum of coordinates of point $B$ is $0+4=\boxed{4}$.
We don't know $s(x)$, so we don't have an expression we can simply stick $1$ in to get an answer
We do, however, know that $s(t(x)) = x^2 +3x-2$
So, if we can figure out what to put into $t(x)$ such that $1$ is output, we can use our expression for $s(t(x))$ to find $s(1)$.
If $t(x) = 1$, then $3x-8=1$, which gives $x =3$, so $t(3)=1$
Therefore, we have $s(t(3)) = s(1)$
But we also know that $s(t(x)) = x^2 + 3x-2$, so $s(t(3)) = 3^2 +3(3) -2 = \boxed{16}$.
Add $(-6/2)^2$ and $(-14/2)^2$ to both sides of the equation to get \[
(x^2-6x +9) +(y^2-14y +49)=25,
\] which in turn can be rewritten as $(x-3)^2 +(y-7)^2 =5^2$
The center of this circle is $(3,7)$, so the line $y=7$ passes through the center of the circle
Hence, the area of the circle that lies below $y=7$ is half the area of the circle
The radius of the circle is $\sqrt{25} = 5$, so the circle has area $25\pi$
Therefore, half the area of the circle is $\boxed{\frac{25\pi}{2}}$.
We apply the distributive property to get:\begin{align*}
\frac{2}{5}\left(\frac{5}{x}+10x^2\right)&= \frac{2}{5}\cdot\frac{5}{x}+\frac{2}{5}\cdot 10x^2\\
&= \boxed{\frac{2}{x} + 4x^2}.
\end{align*}
All three factors are equal to 3, so the product is $3\cdot3\cdot3=\boxed{27}$.
If $y = \frac{1 - x}{2x + 3}$, then $1-x=(2x+3)y=2xy+3y$
We can rearrange to $1-3y=x(2y+1)$
When $2y+1=0$ or $y=-\frac12$, the left hand side is nonzero while the right hand side is zero, so the value $y = \boxed{-\frac12}$ is unattainable.
We can quickly see that we can get a solution to the equation if the first fraction is 1 and the second is -1 which gives $(x, y) = (2, -3)$
Similarly if we let $(x, y) = (-2, 3)$ we get the first fraction to be $-1$ and the second to be 1
The slope of the line through these two points is $\frac{-3 - 3}{2 - (-2)} = \boxed{- \frac 32}$.
Substitute 4 for $T$ and 8 for $H$ in the given expression, looking to cancel before simplifying the numerator or denominator: \[
\frac{25(4)^4}{(8)^2}=\frac{25\cdot 2^8}{2^6}=25 \cdot 2^2=\boxed{100}.
The equation implies that either \[
x-1 = x-2\]or \[ x-1 = -(x-2).\]The first equation has no solution; the second equation has solution $x= \boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$.
The slope between the first two points must be the same as the slope between the second two points, because all three points lie on the same line
We thus have the equation $\dfrac{k-8}{-2-6}=\dfrac{4-k}{-10-(-2)}.$ Solving for $k$ yields $k=\boxed{6}$.
We use the distance formula to find the length of each side.
The distance from $(0, 1)$ to $(2, 5)$ is $\sqrt{(2 - 0)^2 + (5 - 1)^2} = 2\sqrt{5}$.
The distance from $(2, 5)$ to $(5, 2)$ is $\sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (2 - 5)^2} = 3\sqrt{2}$.
The distance from $(5, 2)$ to $(7, 0)$ is $\sqrt{(7 - 5)^2 + (0 - 2)^2} = 2\sqrt{2}$.
The distance from $(7, 0)$ to $(0, 1)$ is $\sqrt{(0 - 7)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = 5\sqrt{2}$.
Adding all of these side lengths, we find that the perimeter is $10\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{5}$
Thus, our final answer is $10 + 2 = \boxed{12}$.
Writing this as an inequality, we get the expression \begin{align*} n^2-9n+18&<0 \quad \Rightarrow
\\ (n-3)(n-6)&<0.
\end{align*} Since 3 and 6 are roots of the quadratic, the inequality must change sign at these two points
Thus, we continue by testing the 3 intervals of $n$
For $n<3$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive
For $3<n<6$, only $n-6$ is negative, so the inequality is negative
Finally, for $n>6$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again
This tells us that the range of $n$ that satisfy the inequality is $3<n<6$
Since the question asks for the largest integer value of $n$, the answer is the largest integer smaller than 6, which is $\boxed{5}$.
The area of the land would be $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of the side
Since it has to be at least 400 square feet, we get $s^2\geq 400$
Therefore, we get that $s \le -20 \text{ or } s \ge 20$
Since the dimensions can't be negative, the least value of $s$ would be $\boxed{20}$.
Since $f(7)=50$, we have $f^{-1}(50)=7$
Similarly, $f(3)=10$ and $f(5)=26$, so $f^{-1}(10)=3$ and $f^{-1}(26)=5$
Therefore,  \begin{align*}f^{-1}\left(f^{-1}(50)\times f^{-1}(10)+f^{-1}(26)\right)&=f^{-1}(7\times3+5)\\
&=f^{-1}(26)=\boxed{5}.\end{align*}
Rearranging, $|y|=2.$ Thus, $y=\pm 2$ and the product of the solutions is $\boxed{-4}.$
The distance between the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ and an endpoint of $\overline{AB}$ is equal to half of the length of $\overline{AB}$
By the distance formula,
\begin{align*}
AB &= \sqrt{((t-4)-(-2))^2 + ((-1)-(t+3))^2}\\
&= \sqrt{(t-2)^2+(t+4)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{2t^2 + 4t + 20}
\end{align*}Also, we know that $(AB/2)^2 = t^2/2 \Longrightarrow AB = 2\sqrt{t^2/2} = \sqrt{2t^2}$
Setting these two expressions equal and squaring, we obtain $$AB^2 = 2t^2 = 2t^2 + 4t + 20 \Longrightarrow 4t + 20 = 0.$$Thus, $t = \boxed{-5}$.
At the end of the first day, there are 2 amoebas
At the end of the second, there are $2\cdot 2 = 2^2$ amoebas
At the end of the third day, there are $2\cdot 2^2 = 2^3$ amoebas, and so on
So, after the seventh day, there are $2^7= \boxed{128}$ amoebas.
Since $(\sqrt2\pm1)^2=2\pm2\sqrt2+1=3\pm2\sqrt2$, $$\sqrt{6+4\sqrt2}=\sqrt{2(3+2\sqrt2)}=\sqrt2(\sqrt2+1)=2+\sqrt2.$$Similarly, $$\sqrt{6-4\sqrt2}=\sqrt2(\sqrt2-1)=2-\sqrt2.$$Therefore, $$\sqrt{6+4\sqrt2}+\sqrt{6-4\sqrt2}=(2+\sqrt2)+(2-\sqrt2)=\boxed{4}.$$
If we multiply the second equation, the reciprocal of the first equation, and the reciprocal of the third equation, we get \[\frac{s}{r}\cdot\frac{r}{q}\cdot \frac{t}{s} = 6\cdot \frac{1}{9}\cdot2\Rightarrow \frac{t}{q}= \boxed{\frac{4}{3}}.\]
We begin by multiplying out the denominator and then  squaring both sides \begin{align*}
\frac{\sqrt{5x}}{\sqrt{3(x-1)}}&=2\\
(\sqrt{5x})^2 &=\left(2\sqrt{3(x-1)}\right)^2\\
5x &= 12(x-1)\\
12& =7x\\
x&=\boxed{\frac{12}{7}}.\\
\end{align*}Checking, we see that this value of $x$ satisfies the original equation, so it is not an extraneous solution.
Note that $\left(x^3-8\right)^2=x^6-16x^3+64$
So $\frac{x^6-16x^3+64}{x^3-8}=\frac{\left(x^3-8\right)^2}{x^3-8}=x^3-8$
So, the answer is $6^3-8=216-8=\boxed{208}$.
Dividing by 2, we get
\[x^2 + y^2 + 5x - 3y - 9 = 0.\]Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get
\[\left( x + \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 + \left( y - \frac{3}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{35}{2},\]so the area of the circle is $\boxed{\frac{35}{2} \pi}.$
If the quadratic equation $x^2 + (2a+1)x + a^2 = 0$ has two integer solutions, then $$x = \frac{-2a-1 \pm \sqrt{(2a+1)^2 - 4a^2}}{2}$$is an integer, so it follows that the discriminant $(2a+1)^2 - 4a^2 = 4a + 1$ must be a perfect square
Also, $1 \le a \le 50$, so it follows that $5 \le 4a+1 \le 201$
Clearly $4a+1$ can only be the square of an odd integer; conversely, the square of any odd integer $(2n+1)^2$ is of the form $4n^2 + 4n+1 = 4(n^2 + n) + 1$ and so can be written as $4a+1$
The odd perfect squares from $5$ to $201$ are given by $9 = 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, 9^2, 11^2, 169 = 13^2$, so it follows that there are $\boxed{6}$ such values of $a$.
Not to be tricked by the excess of parentheses, we rewrite the expression as a geometric series: \[3+3^2+3^3+\cdots +3^9 +3^{10}.\]Now the sum can be computed as $\frac{3^{11}-3}{3-1}=\boxed{88572}.$
We factor the denominator in the left-hand side to get \[\frac{3x+5}{(x-7)(x+6)}= \frac{A}{x - 7} + \frac{B}{x + 6}.\]We then multiply both sides by $(x - 7)(x + 6)$, to get \[3x + 5 = A(x + 6) + B(x - 7).\]We can solve for $A$ and $B$ by substituting suitable values of $x$
For example, setting $x = 7$, the equation becomes $26 = 13A$, so $A = 2$
Setting $x = -6$, the equation becomes $-13 = -13B$, so $B = 1$
Therefore, $(A,B) = \boxed{(2,1)}$.
This is an infinite geometric series with first term $a=1$ and common ratio $r=\frac{1}{3}$
Thus the sum is: $$\frac{a}{1-r} = \frac{1}{1-\frac13} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}}=\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}.$$
Simplifying, we get $2x^2+24x-60=x^2 + 13x.$ Bringing the right side to the left, we get $x^2+11x-60=0$
Factoring, we find that $(x+15)(x-4)=0$
Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are 4 and -15, and of those, $\boxed{-15}$ is the smallest.
First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-10x-10=x^2-4x+6$
Combine like terms to get $x^2-6x=16$
To complete the square, we need to add $\left(\dfrac{6}{2}\right)^2=9$ to both sides, giving $(x-3)^2=16+9=25$.
So we have $x-3=\pm5$
Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $8$
Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\boxed{(-2,18)}$ and $\boxed{(8,38)}$.
Because we cannot divide by zero, values of $x$ that make the denominator of the fraction equal to zero must be excluded from the domain
Thus, we must first find all values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2-4=0$
Since this factors as $(x+2)(x-2)=0$, the only two values we need to exclude from the domain are $2$ and $-2$
This gives us the solution $x\in\boxed{(-\infty,-2)\cup(-2, 2)\cup(2,\infty)}$.
\begin{align*}
2^{x-3} &= 4^{x+1} \\
2^{x-3} &= (2^2)^{x+1} \\
2^{x-3} &= 2^{2x+2} \\
x-3 &= 2x+2 \\
x &= \boxed{-5}
\end{align*}
The terms of sequence $A$ are $2,$ $4,$ $8,$ $16,$ $32,$ $64,$ $128,$ $256,$ $512.$ The terms of sequence $B$ start from $20$ and go up by $20$ each time, so sequence $B$ is precisely all multiples of $20$ from $20$ to $320.$ We thus need to see which term in sequence $A$ is closest to a multiple of $20.$ $16,$ $64,$ and $256$ are the closest, each being $4$ away from a multiple of $20.$ So the least positive difference between a term in sequence $A$ and one in sequence $B$ is $\boxed{4}.$
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of the equation $3x^2+4x-9$
We want to find $x_1^2+x_2^2$
Note that $x_1^2+x_2^2=(x_1+x_2)^2-2x_1x_2$
We know that $x_1+x_2$, the sum of the roots, is equal to $\frac{-b}{a}$, which for this equation is $\frac{-4}{3}$
Likewise, we know that $x_1x_2$, the product of the roots, is equal to $\frac{c}{a}$, which for this equation is $\frac{-9}{3}$
Thus, $x_1^2+x_2^2=\left(\frac{-4}{3}\right)^2-2\left(\frac{-9}{3}\right)=\frac{16}{9}+\frac{18}{3}=\boxed{\frac{70}{9}}$.
If $p$ is the number of pennies and $n$ is the number of nickels that Zachary used, then we are given \begin{align*}
p+n&=32\text{, and} \\
p+5n&=100.
\end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second, we find $4n=68$ which implies $n=\boxed{17}$.
Since $9$ can be written as $3^2$, we know that $3^{x^2+4x+4}=3^{2(x+2)}$ and $x^2+4x+4=2(x+2)$
Solving for $x$ we have: \begin{align*}
x^2+4x+4=2x+4\\
\Rightarrow x^2+2x=0\\
\Rightarrow x(x+2)=0\\
\end{align*}So, $x=-2$ or $x=0$
Checking these solutions, we find that $3^0=9^0$ and $3^4=9^2$, which are both true statements
The sum of all possible values of $x$ is $-2+0=\boxed{-2}$.
Let the two numbers be $m=AB$ and $n=CD$ (where $A,B,C$ and $D$ are digits)
The average of $m$ and $n$ is $\frac{m+n}{2}$ and the number formed by writing $m$ before the decimal point and $n$ after the decimal point is: $$AB.CD = AB + 0.CD = AB+\frac{CD}{100} = m+\frac{n}{100}.$$ Setting these equal gives: \begin{align*}
\frac{m+n}{2} &= m+\frac{n}{100}\\
50m+50n &= 100m+n\\
49n &= 50m
\end{align*} From this it follows that $n$ a multiple of 50
As $n$ is a 2-digit positive integer this means that $n=50$
So now $50m = 49n = 49\cdot 50$, so $m=49$
Thus the integers are $49$ and $50$, so the smaller integer is $\boxed{49}$.
We have $$\frac14\%\times120=\frac{\frac14}{100}\times120=\frac{1}{400}\times120=\frac{12}{40}=\frac{3}{10}=\boxed{.3}.$$
Let the other endpoint be $(x,y)$
We have the equations $(x+8)/2=6$ and $(y+0)/2=-10$, or $x=4$ and $y=-20$
The sum of the coordinates is $4+(-20)=\boxed{-16}$.
Since $g(x)=3f^{-1}(x)$, we have that $3f^{-1}(x)=15$
This means that $f^{-1}(x)=\frac{15}{3}=5$
Since $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are inverse functions, if $f^{-1}(x)=5$, we also have that $f(5)=x$
Substituting this back into our equation $f(x)=\frac{24}{x+3}$, we get that $$x=f(5)=\frac{24}{5+3}=\boxed{3}.$$
For $f$ to have an inverse function, it must not take any repeated value -- that is, we must not have $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ for distinct $x_1$ and $x_2$ in its domain.
The graph of $y=(x+2)^2-5$ is a parabola with vertex at $(-2,-5)$:
unitsize(0.2 cm);
Label f;
f.p=fontsize(4);
xaxis(-6,3,Ticks(f, 1.0, Size=1));
yaxis(-6,5,Ticks(f, 1.0, Size=1));
real g(real x)
return (x+2)^2-5;
draw(graph(g,-5.2,1.2));
dot((-2,-5));
label("Vertex: $(-2,-5)$", (-2,-5), SW);
[/asy] The axis of symmetry is the line $x=-2$, so for every $x$ less than $-2$, there is a corresponding $x$ greater than $-2$ where $f$ takes the same value
If we restrict the domain of $f$ to $[-2,\infty)$, then $f$ has no repeated values, as $f$ is increasing throughout its domain
But if we restrict the domain to $[c,\infty)$ where $c<-2$, then $f$ has repeated values
So, the smallest $c$ which will work is $c=\boxed{-2}$.
Reading the book takes Xanthia
$\frac{225}{100}=2.25$ hours.
It takes Molly
$\frac{225}{50}=4.5$ hours.
The difference is $2.25$ hours, or $2.25(60)=\boxed{135}$ minutes.
Plugging in to the definition, $6\& 3 = (6 + 3)(6-3) = 9\cdot 3 = \boxed{27}$.
Using the quadratic formula, we find that the roots of the quadratic are $\frac{-3\pm\sqrt{3^2-4(7)(k)}}{14}=\frac{-3\pm\sqrt{9-28k}}{14}$
Since the problem tells us that these roots must equal $\frac{-3\pm i\sqrt{299}}{14}$, we have \begin{align*} \sqrt{9-28k}&=i\sqrt{299}
\\\Rightarrow\qquad 9-28k&=-299
\\\Rightarrow\qquad -28k&=-308
\\\Rightarrow\qquad k&=\boxed{11}.
\end{align*}
We have $\&(12\&)=\&(7-12)=\&(-5)=(-5-7)=\boxed{-12}$.
First, we can factor out $1000=10^3$, so $\sqrt[3]{2744000}=10\sqrt[3]{2744}$
To proceed, we can take out factors of two from 2744, to find that $2744=2\cdot1372=2\cdot2\cdot686=2^3\cdot343$
With a little bit of guess and check, notice that $7^3=343$
Therefore, $10\sqrt[3]{2744}=10(14)=\boxed{140}$.
First, we find \[\frac1{x} = \frac12\left(\left(\frac1{x}+\frac1{y}\right)+\left(\frac1{x}-\frac1{y}\right)\right) = \frac12(3+(-7)) = -2.\] Therefore, $x = -\frac12$
Similarly, we find \[\frac1{y} = \frac12\left(\left(\frac1{x}+\frac1{y}\right)-\left(\frac1{x}-\frac1{y}\right)\right) = \frac12(3-(-7)) = 5.\] Therefore, $y = \frac15$
Our desired sum is \[x+y = -\frac12 + \frac15 = \boxed{-\frac{3}{10}}.\]
The numerator $x^2 - 80x + 1551$ factors as $(x - 47)(x - 33)$, and the denominator $x^2 + 57x - 2970$ factors as $(x - 33)(x + 90)$, so \[\frac{x^2 - 80x + 1551}{x^2 + 57x - 2970} = \frac{(x - 47)(x - 33)}{(x - 33)(x + 90)} = \frac{x - 47}{x + 90}.\]Then $\alpha = 47$ and $\beta = 90$, so $\alpha + \beta = 47 + 90 = \boxed{137}$.
We can also solve the problem using Vieta's formulas, which states that the sum of the roots of the quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$
The only way that the right-hand side $\frac{x^2-80x+1551}{x^2+57x-2970}$ can simplify to the left-hand side $\frac{x-\alpha}{x+\beta}$ is if $x^2-80x+1551$ and $x^2+57x-2970$ have a root in common
Call this common root $\gamma$.
Then the roots of $x^2 - 80x + 1551 = 0$ are $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, so $\alpha + \gamma = 80$
Similarly, the roots of $x^2 + 57x - 2970 = 0$ are $-\beta$ and $\gamma$, so $-\beta + \gamma = -57$
Subtracting these equations, we get $\alpha + \beta = 80 - (-57) = \boxed{137}$.
We have $g(x) = f(-2x)$, which is defined if and only if $-2x$ is in the domain of $f$, that is, if $$-8 \le -2x \le 4.$$ Dividing all expressions in this chain of inequalities by $-2$ compels us to reverse the direction of the inequalities: $$4\ge x\ge -2.$$ Thus $g(x)$ is defined if and only if $-2\le x\le 4$
In other words, the domain of $g(x)$ is $\boxed{[-2,4]}$.
In those extra $22-15=7$ hours, she earned $7x$, where $x$ is her hourly rate
It follows that $x = \frac{47.60}{7} = 6.8$
Thus she earned $(22+15)x = 37x = \boxed{\$ 251.60}$ over those two weeks.
First, we note that there are two points on the graph whose $y$-coordinates are $-3$
These are $(-4,-3)$ and $(0,-3)$
Therefore, if $f(f(f(x)))=-3$, then $f(f(x))$ equals $-4$ or $0$.
There are three points on the graph whose $y$-coordinates are $-4$ or $0$
These are $(-2,-4),$ $(-6,0),$ and $(2,0)$
Therefore, if $f(f(x))$ is $-4$ or $0$, then $f(x)$ equals $-2,$ $-6,$ or $2$.
There are four points on the graph whose $y$-coordinates are $-2$ or $2$ (and none whose $y$-coordinate is $-6$)
The $x$-coordinates of these points are not integers, but we can use the symmetry of the graph (with respect to the vertical line $x=-2$) to deduce that if these points are $(x_1,-2),$ $(x_2,-2),$ $(x_3,2),$ and $(x_4,2),$ then $x_1+x_2=-4$ and $x_3+x_4=-4$
Therefore, the sum of all four $x$-coordinates is $\boxed{-8}$.
We know that $f(1)=5,$ $f(2)=3,$ and $f(3)=1$.
Therefore, $f(f(2))=f(3)=1$ and $f(f(3))=f(1)=5$.
This tells us that the graph of $y=f(f(x))$ passes through $(2,1)$ and $(3,5)$, and the desired expression is $(2)(1)+(3)(5)=\boxed{17}$.
Squaring the equation provided, we get $x^2+2(x)\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) +\frac{1}{x^2}=36,$ so $x^2+\frac{1}{x^2}=\boxed{34}.$
We begin by expressing both sides of the equation in terms of the base 2: $(3^3)^8=(3^2)^q$, which simplifies to $3^{24}=3^{2q}$
Setting the exponents equal to each other, $24=2q$, or $q=\boxed{12}$.
Note that $f(-2) = a(-8)+b(4)+c(-2)+d$
Therefore, $$8a-4b+2c-d = -f(-2).$$Since the point $(-2,-3)$ is on the graph of $f(x)$, we infer that $$-f(-2) = -(-3) = \boxed{3}.$$
Factor twice using difference squares to obtain $(2^8-1)=(2^4+1)(2^4-1)=(2^4+1)(2^2+1)(2^2-1)=17\cdot5\cdot3$
The sum of the 3 prime factors of $2^8-1$ is $17+5+3=\boxed{25}$.
Two lines that are parallel have the same slope
Therefore, the slope of line $a$ is $2$
Using the point-slope formula, we get that the equation for line $a$ is $y-5=2(x-2)=2x-4$
In slope-intercept form, the equation is $y=2x+1$
Therefore, the y-intercept is $\boxed{1}$.
For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $1 + 2 + \dots + 49 = 49 \cdot 50/2 = \boxed{1225}$.
The quadratic is the square of $3y$,  the constant term is the square of $-5$, and the linear term equals $2(3y)(-5)$, so we have $9y^2 -30y + 25 = \boxed{(3y - 5)^2}$.
\begin{align*}
QED &= (5+2i)(i)(5-2i)\\
&=i(25-(2i)^2)\\
&=i(25+4)\\
&=\boxed{29i}.
\end{align*}
Let the common ratio of the first sequence be $p$ and the common ratio of the second sequence be $r$
Then the equation becomes
$$kp^2-kr^2=2(kp-kr)$$Dividing both sides by $k$ (since the sequences are nonconstant, no term can be $0$), we get
$$p^2-r^2=2(p-r)$$The left side factors as $(p-r)(p+r)$
Since $p\neq r$, we can divide by $p-r$ to get
$$p+r=\boxed{2}$$
Using the distributive property, we can expand this to get \begin{align*}
(x^{22}&-3x^{5} + x^{-2} - 7)\cdot(5x^4)\\
&=(x^{22})(5x^4)+(-3x^5)(5x^4)+(x^{-2})(5x^4)-7(5x^4)\\
&=5x^{26}-15x^9+5x^2-35x^4\\
&=\boxed{5x^{26}-15x^9-35x^4+5x^2}.
\end{align*}
Let the length of the enclosure be $l$ and the width be $w$
We have the equation $2l+2w=300 \Rightarrow l + w = 150$
We want to maximize the area of this rectangular tennis court, which is given by $lw$
From our equation, we know that $l=150-w$
Substituting this into our expression for area, we have \[(150-w)(w)=150w-w^2\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression
Factoring a $-1$ out, we have \[-(w^2-150w)\]In order for the expression inside the parentheses to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(150/2)^2=5625$ inside the parentheses
Doing this, we get \[-(w^2-150w+5625-5625) \Rightarrow -(w-75)^2+5625\]The expression is maximized when $-(w-75)^2$ is maximized, or in other words when $(w-75)^2$ is minimized
Thus, we wish to make $w$ as close as possible to 75, considering the condition that $l\ge80$
When $l=80$, $w=150-l=70$
Since as $l$ increases, $w$ decreases further below 70, the optimal dimensions are $l=80$ and $w=70$
Hence, the optimal area is $lw=80\cdot70=\boxed{5600}$ square feet.
Let the common ratio of the geometric sequence be $r$
We have the equations $140\cdot r = a$ and $a \cdot r = \frac{45}{28}$
In the first equation, we solve for $r$ to get $r=\frac{a}{140}$, and substitute this into the second equation to eliminate $r$, resulting in $a \cdot \frac{a}{140} = \frac{45}{28}$, or $a = \boxed{15}$.
The only ways to write 13 as the product of two integers is as $13 = 1 \times 13$ or $13 = (-1) \times (-13)$
We take these two cases separately.
In the case $13 = 1 \times 13$, we must have $a_4 = 1$ and $a_5 = 13$, since the sequence is increasing
Then the common difference is $13 - 1 = 12$, so $a_3 = a_4 - 12 = 1 - 12 = -11$, and $a_6 = a_5 + 12 = 13 + 12 = 25$, so $a_3 a_6 = (-11) \cdot 25 = -275$.
In the case $13 = (-1) \times (-13)$, we must have $a_4 = -13$ and $a_5 = -1$
Then the common difference is $-1 - (-13) = 12$, so $a_3 = a_4 - 12 = -13 - 12 = -25$, and $a_6 = a_5 + 12 = (-1) + 12 = 11$, so $a_3 a_6 = (-25) \cdot 11 = -275$.
Hence, $a_3 a_6 = \boxed{-275}$.
By subtracting $3x$ and dividing both sides by $-2$ we get $y = \frac 32 x - 3$ meaning this line has slope $\frac{3}{2}$ and any line perpendicular to it has slope $-\frac{2}{3}$
Using the slope-intercept form of a line we get that the equation of the line perpendicular to it with $y$-intercept of 2 is $y = -\frac{2}{3} x + 2$
We find the $x$-intercept by letting $y = 0$ which gives $x = \boxed{3}$.
$(3-2i)- (5-2i) = 3-2i -5+2i = (3-5) + (-2i+2i) = \boxed{-2}$.
To expand, we multiply $(3x-6)$ by $x$ and add that product to the product of $(3x-6)$ and $2$
\begin{align*}
(x+2)(3x-6) &= x\cdot(3x-6) +2\cdot(3x-6)\\
&= (3x^2-6x) + (6x-12)
\end{align*}Combining like terms gives a final answer of $\boxed{3x^2-12}$.
Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this polynomial
Since $-\frac{b}{a}$ is the sum and $\frac{c}{a}$ is the product of the roots of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we have $r_1+r_2=5$ and $r_1r_2=t$
Since $r_1$ and $r_2$ are positive integers, the only possible ordered pairs $(r_1,r_2)$ are $(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),$ and $(4,1)$
These produce the values of 4,6,6, and 4 respectively for $t$
Therefore, the average of the distinct possibilities, 4 and 6, is $\boxed{5}$.
The problems asks us to substitute $7$ for $a$ and $2$ for $b$ in the expression $3a+5b$
We find that $7\S 2=3(7)+5(2)=21+10=\boxed{31}$.
Since this is an infinite geometric series, we have $\frac{328}{1-r} = 2009$
Solving for $r$, we find that $r = \boxed{\frac{41}{49}}$.
You should note quickly in your head that $3a - 3b = 3(a-b)$
Then, plugging in $a = 3$ and $b=5$, we get $3(3-5) = 3(-2) = \boxed{-6}$.
Using the associative property and combining like terms, $(3p^3 - 5p + 6) + (4 - 6p^2 + 2p) = 3p^3 - 6p^2 - 5p + 2p + 6 + 4 = \boxed{3p^3 - 6p^2 - 3p + 10}$.
Since addition is associative, we can rearrange the terms:
$139+27+23+11=(139+11)+(27+23)=150+50=\boxed{200}$.
Because $3\ge -2,$ we use the second case to determine that $f(3) = 5-2(3) = \boxed{-1}.$
Call the two integers $x$ and $y$
We are given that $x^2 + y^2 = 90$ and that $xy = 27$
We want to find $x + y$
Note that $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = 90 + 2\cdot 27 = 144$
Taking the square root of 144, we see that $x + y = \boxed{12}$.
Subtracting the two equations gives: \begin{align*}
(2012a + 2016b)-(2010a + 2014b) &= 2020-2018\\
2a+2b &= 2\\
a+b &= 1
\end{align*}Multiplying this equation by 2010 and subtracting the resulting equation from $ 2010a + 2014b=2018$ gives \begin{align*}
4b &= (2010a + 2014b) - 2010(a+b)
\\\Rightarrow \qquad 4b &= 2018-2010
\\\Rightarrow \qquad 4b &= 8
\\\Rightarrow \qquad b &=2.
\end{align*}So $a-b = (a+b) - 2b = 1-4 = \boxed{-3}$.
$1 - iz = -1 + iz \Rightarrow 2 = 2iz \Rightarrow z = \frac{1}{i}$
Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $-i$, we get $z = \frac{1}{i} \cdot \frac{-i}{-i} = \frac{-i}{1} = \boxed{-i}$.
We square both sides to get rid of the square root sign
This gives us $5+2z = 121$
Solving for $z$ gives $z = \boxed{58}$
We squared an equation, so we have to test our solution to make sure it isn't extraneous
We have
\[\sqrt{5 +2 \cdot 58} =\sqrt{121} = 11\]so our solution is valid.
If the total amount that I earn for the summer is constant, then the number of hours I work each week and the total number of weeks that I work are inversely proportional
Consequently, if I only work $\frac{10}{12}=\frac56$ as many weeks, I need to work $\frac{6}{5}$ as many hours each week
$\frac{6}{5}\cdot20=24$, so I need to work $\boxed{24}$ hours a week.
We can use difference of squares to see that  $$(\sqrt{2009}+\sqrt{2008})(\sqrt{2009}-\sqrt{2008})=2009-2008=1$$ Also,  $$(-\sqrt{2009}+\sqrt{2008})(-\sqrt{2009}-\sqrt{2008})=2009-2008=1$$ So the product is $\boxed{1}$.
The number $f^{-1}(-3)$ is the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = -3$
Since the function $f$ is defined piecewise, to find this value, we must consider both cases $x \le 1$ and $x > 1$.
If $x \le 1$ and $f(x) = -3$, then $2 - x = -3$, which leads to $x = 5$
But this value does not satisfy the condition $x \le 1$
If $x > 1$ and $f(x) = -3$, then $2x - x^2 = -3$, or $x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0$
This equation factors as $(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0$, so $x = 3$ or $x = -1$
The only value that satisfies the condition $x > 1$ is $x = 3$, so $f^{-1}(-3) = 3$.
Next, we compute $f^{-1}(0)$, which is the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 0$.
If $x \le 1$ and $f(x) = 0$, then $2 - x = 0$, which leads to $x = 2$
But this value does not satisfy the condition $x \le 1$
If $x > 1$ and $f(x) = 0$, then $2x - x^2 = 0$, or $x^2 - 2x = 0$
This equation factors as $x(x - 2) = 0$, so $x = 0$ or $x = 2$
The only value that satisfies $x > 1$ is $x = 2$, so $f^{-1}(0) = 2$.
Finally, we compute $f^{-1}(3)$, which is the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 3$.
If $x \le 1$ and $f(x) = 3$, then $2 - x = 3$, which leads to $x = -1$
Note that this value satisfies the condition $x \le 1$
If $x > 1$ and $f(x) = 3$, then $2x - x^2 = 3$, or $x^2 - 2x + 3 = 0$
This equation can be written as $(x - 1)^2 + 2 = 0$, which clearly has no solutions, so $f^{-1}(3) = -1$.
Therefore, $f^{-1}(-3) + f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(3) = 3 + 2 + (-1) = \boxed{4}$.

Since there are 3 feet to a yard, there are $3^3=27$ cubic feet to a cubic yard
Thus, there are $108/27=\boxed{4}$ cubic yards in the volume of the box.
We can have $\log_{7}343=3$ and $\log_{7}2401=4$
Since $\log_{7}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\log_{7}343<\log_{7}2400<\log_{7}2401$, meaning $3<\log_{7}2400<4$
Moreover, we can see that $2400$ is much closer to $2401$ than to $343,$ so it stands to reason that $\log_{7}2400$ rounded to the nearest integer is $\boxed{4}.$
First, we factor the equation as $x(x^2 +3x - 10) = 0$
So, one solution is $x=0$ and the other two solutions are the solutions to $x^2 + 3x-10=0$
We could either factor the quadratic, or note that the sum of the solutions to this quadratic is $-(3/1)=-3$, so the mean of the three solutions to the original equation is $-3/3=\boxed{-1}$.
Since a square root is an exponent of $\frac{1}{2}$ and since exponents distribute across multiplication, we can combine the radicals
\sqrt{8}\cdot \sqrt{50}=\sqrt{8\cdot50}.
\] Now split the radicand into prime factors: $8\cdot50=2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot5^2=(2\cdot2)^2\cdot5^2$
We find $\sqrt{8\cdot50}=\sqrt{(2\cdot2)^2\cdot5^2}=2\cdot2\cdot5=\boxed{20}$.
If $10\%$ of the price of the dirt bike was $\$150$, then $100\%$ of the price must have been ten times the amount that Max paid upfront
Therefore, the price of the bike must have been $10 \times \$150=\boxed{\$ 1500}$.
The function is defined when the value inside the square root is positive, i.e
we must have $x^2-3x-4>0$
Factoring, we get $(x-4)(x+1)>0$
So either both factors in the left hand side are negative or they are both positive
They are both negative when $x<-1$
They are both positive when $x>4$
So the domain of $f(x)$ is $x<-1 \text{ or } x>4$, or $x \in \boxed{(-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)}$ in interval notation.
When we change from a 9-inch wrench to a 15-inch wrench, we multiply the length of the wrench by $\frac{15}{9} = \frac{5}{3}$
Since the wrench length and the force required are inversely proportional, their product must be constant
So, when we multiply the wrench length by $\dfrac53$, we must multiply the force required by $\dfrac35$ in order to keep their product constant
So, the force required is $(375)\left(\frac35\right) = \boxed{225}$ pounds of force.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of the equation $8x^2+12x-14$
We want to find $x_1^2+x_2^2$
Note that $x_1^2+x_2^2=(x_1+x_2)^2-2x_1x_2$
We know that $x_1+x_2$, the sum of the roots, is equal to $\frac{-b}{a}$, which for this equation is $\frac{-12}{8}=\frac{-3}{2}$
Likewise, we know that $x_1x_2$, the product of the roots, is equal to $\frac{c}{a}$, which for this equation is $\frac{-14}{8}=\frac{-7}{4}$
Thus, $x_1^2+x_2^2=\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)^2-2\left(\frac{-7}{4}\right)=\frac{9}{4}+\frac{14}{4}=\boxed{\frac{23}{4}}$.
We only need to look at the constant terms; all the other terms will have variables in them when multiplied
Thus we have $(5)(15)$, which equals $\boxed{75}$.
The term $y$ is simply the average of $2^2 = 4$ and $2^4 = 16$, which is $(4 + 16)/2 = 20/2 = \boxed{10}$.
Since we know that the quotient when we divide $n$ by $d$ is $x$ with a remainder of $7$, we can write $n/d = x + 7/d$
Substituting for $n$ and $d$, this gives $$\frac{x^2+2x+17}{2x+5}=x+\frac{7}{2x+5}.$$Multiplying through by $2x+5$ gives
\begin{align*}
x^2+2x+17&=x(2x+5)+7\\
x^2+2x+17&=2x^2+5x+7\\
0&=x^2+3x-10\\
0&=(x-2)(x+5).
\end{align*}Thus $x=2$ or $x=-5$
We are given that $x$ must be positive, so we have $x=\boxed{2}$.
To check, we see that $x^2+2x+17=(2)^2+2(2)+17=25$, and $2x+5=2(2)+5=9$, and indeed, the quotient when $25$ is divided by $9$ is $x=2$, with a remainder of $7$.
Since the quadratic has only one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero
The discriminant is $b^2-4ac=400-4ac=0$, so $ac=\frac{400}{4}=100$
We need to find $a$ and $c$ given $a+c=29$ and $ac=100$
We could write a quadratic equation and solve, but instead we rely on clever algebraic manipulations: Since $a+c=29$, we have $$(a+c)^2=a^2+c^2+2ac=29^2=841.$$We subtract $4ac=400$ from each side to find $$a^2+c^2+2ac-4ac=a^2+c^2-2ac=841-400=441.$$We recognize each side as a square, so we take the square root of both sides: $$\sqrt{a^2+c^2-2ac}=\sqrt{(c-a)^2}=c-a=\sqrt{441}=21.$$(Technically we should take the positive and negative square root of both sides, but since $c>a$ we know $c-a>0$.) Thus we have  \begin{align*}
c-a&=21\\
c+a&=29
\end{align*}Summing these equations gives \begin{align*}
2c&=50\\
\Rightarrow\qquad c&=25,
\end{align*}and $a=29-c=4$
Thus our ordered pair $(a,c)$ is $\boxed{(4,25)}$.
The sum is an arithmetic series with common difference 2
Let $n$ be the number of terms
Then the $n$th term is $-1$, so $-39 + (n-1)(2) = -1$, or $n = 20$
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $[(-39) + (-1)]/2 \cdot 20 = \boxed{-400}$.
We can see from the graph that there are three vertical asymptotes at $x = -2, 1, 2$
It follows that the denominator of the equation is given by $x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C = (x + 2)(x - 2)(x - 1) = (x^2 - 4)(x-1) = x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4$
Thus, $A+B+C = -1 -4 + 4 = \boxed{-1}$.
The first function has a minimum value of 0, while the second has a maximum of 0
Also, their zeros occur at different spots (in the former case, at $x = -\frac{5}{2}$, in the latter, at $x = \frac{2}{3}$)
Hence their graphs do not intersect, so our answer is $\boxed{0}.$
Let $a$ denote the price of a sack of apples, $b$ the price of a bunch of bananas, $c$ the price of a cantaloupe, and $d$ the price of a carton of dates
We can express the information given in the problem by the following system of linear equations:  \begin{align*}
a+b+c+d &= 20\\
2a &= d\\
a-b &= c
\end{align*}
Substituting into the first equation for $c$ and $d$ gives $a + b + a - b + 2a = 20$, which simplifies to $4a = 20$, so $a = 5$
From here, we use $a$ to find $d = 2 \cdot 5 = 10$
We put these values into the first equation to get $5 + b + c + 10 = 20$, so $b + c = \boxed{ \$ 5}$.
The common difference in this arithmetic sequence is $-2 - (-8) = 6$
The $2000^{\text{th}}$ term is $a + 1999d$, and the $2005^{\text{th}}$ term is $a + 2004d$, so the positive difference between these two term is $(a + 2004d) - (a + 1999d) = 5d = 5 \cdot 6 = \boxed{30}$.
For Manu to win on his first turn, the sequence of flips would have to be TTH, which has probability $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3$
For Manu to win on his second turn, the sequence of flips would have to be TTTTTH, which has probability $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6$
Continuing, we find that the probability that Manu wins on his $n$th turn is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{3n}$
The probability that Manu wins is the sum of these probabilities, which is \[
\frac{1}{2^3}+\frac{1}{2^6}+\frac{1}{2^9}+\cdots=\frac{\frac{1}{2^3}}{1-\frac{1}{2^3}}=\boxed{\frac{1}{7}},
\] where we have used the formula $a/(1-r)$ for the sum of an infinite geometric series whose first term is $a$ and whose common ratio is $r$.
Since $(9,7)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we know  \[7=f(9).\]If we substitute $x=\frac92$ into $2y=\frac{f(2x)}2+2$ we get  \[2y=\frac{f(2\cdot9/2)}2+2=\frac72+2=\frac{11}2.\]Therefore $(x,y)=\left(\frac92,\frac{11}4\right)$ is on the graph of  \[2y=\frac{f(2x)}2+2.\]The sum of these coordinates is  \[\frac92+\frac{11}4=\boxed{\frac{29}4}.\]
We have $$\sqrt[3]{2700} = \sqrt[3]{27}\times \sqrt[3]{100} = \sqrt[3]{3^3}\times \sqrt[3]{100} = 3\sqrt[3]{100}.$$  Since the prime factorization of 100 is $2^2\cdot5^2$, we cannot simplify $\sqrt[3]{100}$ any further
Therefore, we have $a+b = \boxed{103}$.
Since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$, it follows that $a(bx+a)+b=x$, which implies $abx + a^2 +b = x$
This equation holds for all values of $x$ only if $ab=1$ and $a^2+b=0$.
Then $b = -a^2$
Substituting into the equation $ab = 1$, we get $-a^3 = 1$
Then $a = -1$, so $b = -1$, and  \[f(x)=-x-1.\]Likewise  \[f^{-1}(x)=-x-1.\]These are inverses to one another since  \[f(f^{-1}(x))=-(-x-1)-1=x+1-1=x.\]\[f^{-1}(f(x))=-(-x-1)-1=x+1-1=x.\]Therefore $a+b=\boxed{-2}$.
We complete the square
First, we factor 2 out of the terms $2x^2 + 6x$ to get $2(x^2 + 3x)$
We can square $x + 3/2$ to get $x^2 + 3x + 9/4$, so $h = \boxed{-\frac{3}{2}}$.
By considering the expression $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the solutions of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we find that the solutions are rational if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ has a rational square root
Therefore, the solutions of $kx^2+20x+k=0$ are rational if and only if $400-4(k)(k)$ is a perfect square
(Recall that if $n$ is an integer which is not a perfect square, then $\sqrt{n}$ is irrational)
By writing the discriminant as $4(100-k^2)$, we see that we only need to check the integers $1\leq k\leq 10$
Of these, $\boxed{6, 8\text{, and }10}$ work.
Instead of expanding the entire product, we can look only at terms that will multiply to give $x^3$
We know that: $$x^3=x^3\cdot 1=x^2\cdot x=x\cdot x^2=1\cdot x^3$$Knowing this, the $x^3$ term in the expansion will be the sum of these four terms: $$(-3x^3)(7)+(5x^2)(4x)+(-6x)(-3x^2)+(1)(2x^3)$$We simplify to find: \begin{align*}
&(-3x^3)(7)+(5x^2)(4x)+(-6x)(-3x^2)+(1)(2x^3)\\
&\qquad=-21x^3+20x^3+18x^3+2x^3\\
&\qquad=\boxed{19}x^3.
\end{align*}
First we solve for $x$
Converting our logarithm to exponential form gives $25^{\frac{1}{2}}=x-4$
We know $25^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt{25}=5$, so we have $5=x-4$ or $x=9$
Then we must find $\frac{1}{\log_{x}3}$ where $x=9$
Let $\log_{9}{3}=a$
Then $9^a=3$
Since $9=3^2$ we have $3^{2a}=3^1$ so $2a=1$ or $a=\frac{1}{2}$
We want to find $\frac{1}{\log_{9}3}=\frac{1}{a}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}}=\boxed{2}$.
This is a geometric sequence with first term 2 and common ratio 3
Thus, any term in this sequence can be represented as $2\cdot3^k$ for some non-negative integer $k$, where $k+1$ represents the term number (for example, when $k=0$, $2\cdot3^k = 2$, which is the $k+1=1^\text{st}$ term of the sequence)
We need to find the smallest $k$ such that $2\cdot3^k>100$
Using trial and error, we find that $k=4$, which means that the $4+1=5^\text{th}$ day is the the one on which Jasmine has more than 100 paperclips, or $\boxed{\text{Friday}}$.
We note that $$q(x) = -|x| = \begin{cases}x &\text{if }x\le 0\\-x &\text{if }x>0\end{cases}.$$Therefore, $$q(p(x)) = -|p(x)| = \begin{cases}p(x) &\text{if }p(x)\le 0\\-p(x) &\text{if }p(x)>0\end{cases}.$$A graph of $y=q(p(x))$ looks like the graph of $y=p(x)$ with the parts above the $x$-axis reflected so that they lie below the $x$-axis: [asy]

Setting $\frac{4b+19}{6b+11}$ equal to $0.76=\frac{76}{100}=\frac{19}{25}$, we have \begin{align*} \frac{4b+19}{6b+11}&=\frac{19}{25}

&= \sqrt{2(2+\sqrt{2+c})}\\
&= \sqrt{2}\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+c}}.
\end{align*}Then, we can combine like terms and solve: \begin{align*}
\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+c}}+ \sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+c}} &= 2+2\sqrt{2}\\
\Rightarrow \qquad (1+\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+c}} &=2(1+\sqrt{2})\\
\Rightarrow \qquad \sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+c}} &= 2\\

\Rightarrow \qquad 2+c &= 4\\
\Rightarrow \qquad c &= \boxed{2}

We want to write everything in terms of powers of 3
Doing so gives us $3^n = 3 \cdot (3^2)^3 \cdot (3^4)^2$
This simplifies to $3^n = 3 \cdot 3^6 \cdot 3^8$, so $3^n = 3^{15}$
Therefore, $n = \boxed{15}$.
Writing the equation in exponential form gives us $x^{\frac{5}{2}} = (x^\frac{1}{2})^5 = 32 = 2^5$

To start, use the equation to solve for the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line
Letting $x$ equal 0, the $y$-intercept is 6

[/asy] The enclosed region, shown above in gray, is bounded by two quarter-circle arcs
The portion above and to the left of the red dashed line has area $\frac\pi 4-\frac 12$, since it is a quarter of a unit disc minus a right triangle of base and height $1$
The portion below and to the right of the red dashed line is the same
Thus, the total enclosed region has area $\frac \pi 2-1$; rounded to the nearest hundredth, this is $\boxed{0.57}$.
We begin by adding 2 to both sides of the equation, \begin{align*} 7&=x^2+\frac{1}{x^2}
\\\Rightarrow\qquad 9&=x^2+\frac{1}{x^2}+2
\\\Rightarrow\qquad 9&=x^2+2(x)\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)+\frac{1}{x^2}
\\\Rightarrow\qquad 9&=\left(x+\frac{1}{x}\right)^2
\end{align*}  So, the possible values for $x+\frac{1}{x}$ are $3$ and $-3$
The greater of these is $\boxed{3}$.
First, to average an 80, he must score a 90 on his second exam

Thus $70\cdot 8 = 90 \cdot h \Rightarrow h = 56/9 \approx \boxed{6.2}$.
If the interest compounds quarterly, she owes \[\left(1 + \frac{0.12}{4}\right)^{4\cdot 4}(\$6,\!000)\approx \$9,\!628.24.\]  If it compounds annually, she owes \[(1+0.12)^4(\$6,\!000)\approx \$9,\!441.12.\]  Therefore, if the interest compounds quarterly, she owes \[\$9,\!628.24 - \$9,\!441.12 = \boxed{\$187.12}\text{ more.}\]
$-\frac{5}{3}$ is between $-2$ and $-1$, so $\left\lfloor -\frac{5}{3}\right\rfloor = \boxed{-2}$.
When using the distributive property for the first time, we add the product of $2x+3$ and $x$ to the product of $2x+3$ and 5:
\begin{align*}
(2x+3)(x+5) &= (2x+3) \cdot x + (2x+3) \cdot 5\\
&= x(2x+3) + 5(2x+3)
\end{align*}We use the distributive property again and combine like terms:
\begin{align*}
x(2x+3) + 5(2x+3) &= 2x^2 + 3x + 10x+ 15\\
&= \boxed{2x^2 + 13x + 15}
\end{align*}
We have $f(-4) = 3(-4)^2 -7 =41$, so we seek $g(f(-4)) = g(41)$
But what's $g(41)$? So, we turn to the other information we are given, $g(f(4)) = 9$
Since $f(4) = 3(4)^2 - 7=41$, this equation gives us $g(41) = \boxed{9}$.
We are given an equation of the form $x^2 - y^2$, so we factor the equation into the form $(x+y)(x-y)$ to get $(17+10+17-10)(17+10-17+10)$
This simplifies to $34 \cdot 20 = \boxed{680}$.
Since the axis of symmetry is vertical and the vertex is $(2,4)$, the parabola may also be written as  \[y=a(x-2)^2+4\] for some value of $a$
Plugging the point $(1,1)$ into this expression gives  \[1=a(1-2)^2+4=a+4.\] This tells us $a=-3$.
Our equation is  \[y=-3(x-2)^2+4.\] Putting it $y=ax^2+bx+c$ form requires expanding the square, so we get  \[y=-3(x^2-4x+4)+4=\boxed{-3x^2+12x-8}.\]
Since $\text{work} = \text{rate} \times \text{time}$, let $r$ be the rate at which one worker can built an embankment
It follows that 1 embankment takes \[1\text{ embankment}=(75r) \times (4\ \text{days})\] so $r = \frac{1}{4 \cdot 75}.$  If only $50$ workers were available, then  \[1\text{ embankment} = (50r) \times (t\ \text{days})\]  so \[t = \frac{1}{50 \cdot \frac{1}{4 \cdot 75}} = \frac{300}{50} = \boxed{6}\ \text{days}.\] Notice that the number of days and the number of workers are inversely related.
Multiply both sides of the given equation by both denominators to obtain \begin{align*}
5(10x-3y)&=3(13x-2y) \implies \\
50x-15y&=39x-6y.
\end{align*} Collect like terms by adding $15y$ and $-39x$ to both sides to obtain $11x=9y$
Finally, divide both sides by $11y$ to find that $\dfrac{x}{y}=\boxed{\frac{9}{11}}$.
In an arithmetic sequence, the average of two terms equals the value of the term halfway between them
So we have that $b = \frac{17 + 41}{2} = \boxed{29}$.
The amount of tax collected is $\frac{x}{100} \cdot 1000x = 10x^2,$ so the take home pay is
\[1000x - 10x^2.\]Completing the square, we get
\begin{align*}
1000x - 10x^2 &= -10(x^2 - 100x) \\
&= -10(x^2 - 100x + 2500) + 25000 \\
&= -10(x - 50)^2 + 25000.
\end{align*}The maximum take home pay occurs when $x = 50,$ which corresponds to an income of $\boxed{50000}$ dollars.
We know that $x\star24=\dfrac{\sqrt{x+24}}{\sqrt{x-24}}=7$
Because we cannot take the square root of a negative number and because the denominator of a fraction cannot be zero, we know that $x-24>0$
Thus, a reasonable guess for $x$ would be $x=25$
$\dfrac{\sqrt{25+24}}{\sqrt{25-24}}=\dfrac{\sqrt{49}}{\sqrt{1}}=7$, as desired, so our answer is indeed $x=\boxed{25}$.
First, we know that this point is above the $x$-axis because it is closer to a point in the first quadrant than it is to the $x$-axis
Next, we know that $y=12$ from the given information
By the distance formula, we have the equation $\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(12-6)^2}=10$
Solving, we have \begin{align*}
\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(12-6)^2}=10 \\
x^2-2x+1+36&=100 \\
x^2-2x-63&=0 \\
(x-9)(x+7)&=0
\end{align*}Thus, $x-9=0$ or $x+7=0$, so $x=9$ or $x=-7$
$x=9$ by the given conditions
Thus, our point is $(9,12)$ and is a distance of $\sqrt{9^2+12^2}=15$ units from the origin
$n=\boxed{15}$.
Note that \begin{align*}
f(0) &= a(0)^2+b(0)+c \\
\end{align*}and \begin{align*}
f(1) &= a(1)^2+b(1)+c \\
&=a+b+c.
\end{align*}Thus, \begin{align*}
a+b+2c &= c + (a+b+c) \\
&= f(0)+f(1).
\end{align*}The graph of $y=f(x)$ passes through $(0,7)$ and $(1,4)$, so $f(0)=7$ and $f(1)=4$
Therefore, $a+b+2c = 7 + 4 = \boxed{11}$.
Using the formula $time = \frac{distance}{rate}$, we see that it takes the squirrel $\frac{1}{4}$ hour to travel 1 mile
This is equal to $\boxed{15}$ minutes.
The only positive, real common ratio for this sequence is $\frac{2}{3}$
Thus, if $x$ is the 5th term, then $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 x = 64$, so $x = \boxed{144}.$
Cross-multiplying (which is the same as multiplying both sides by $r-3$ and by $r+5$) gives \[(r+9)(r+5) = (r-2)(r-3).\]Expanding the products on both sides gives  \[r^2 + 9r + 5r + 45 = r^2 -2r - 3r + 6.\]Simplifying both sides gives $r^2 + 14r + 45 = r^2 - 5r + 6$
Simplifying this equation gives $19r = -39$, so $r = \boxed{-\frac{39}{19}}$.
For Allie, 5 and 1 get her no points since they are not multiples of 2, while 4 and 2 are multiples of 2 and each get her 2 points for a total of 4 points
For Betty, 3 and 3 get her no points, 2 gets her 2 points, and 6 is a multiple of 2 and 3, so it gets her 6 points
So, Betty has a total of 8 points and the product of Allie and Betty's total points is $4\cdot8=\boxed{32}$.
Note that \begin{align*}
10x^2 + 12xy + 10y^2 &= (9x^2 + 6xy + y^2) + (x^2 + 6xy + 9y^2) \\
&= (3x + y)^2 + (x + 3y)^2 \\
&= 10^2 + 14^2 = \boxed{296}\end{align*}.
Since the midpoint of a segment has coordinates that are the average of the endpoints, we see that the midpoint has coordinates $\left(\frac{2 - 6}{2}, \frac{3+5}{2}\right) = (-2, 4)$
Thus our desired answer is $-2\cdot 4 = \boxed{-8}$.
When graphed, this function is a parabola that opens upwards
Thus, the minimum possible value of y occurs at the vertex of the parabola
The $x$ coordinate of the vertex is $\frac{-b}{2a}$
Substituting the given values, this yields $\frac{-10}{2}=-5$
Substituting this for $x$ gives the minimum value of $y$ to be \begin{align*}
y&=x^2+10x+21 \\
&=(-5)^2+10(-5)+21 \\
&=25+(-50)+21 \\
&=25-50+21 \\
&=-25+21 \\
&=\boxed{-4}
\end{align*}
First, complete the square as follows: $$z=x^2+2y^2+6x-4y+22=\left(x^2+6x\right)+2\left(y^2-2y\right)+22.$$To complete the square, we need to add $\left(\dfrac{6}{2}\right)^2=9$ after the $6x$ and $\left(\dfrac{2}{2}\right)^2=1$ after the $-2y.$ So we have $$z+9+2(1)=\left(x^2+6x+9\right)+2\left(y^2-2y+1\right)+22.$$This gives $$z=\left(x+3\right)^2+2\left(y-1\right)^2+11.$$Now, since $\left(x+3\right)^2\ge0$ and $\left(y-1\right)^2\ge0,$ the minimum value is when both squared terms are equal to $0.$ So the minimum value is $$z=\left(x+3\right)^2+2\left(y-1\right)^2+11=0+2\cdot0+11=\boxed{11}.$$
The problem is to simplify $\frac{\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{4}\cdot\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{5}\cdot\sqrt{7}}$
Writing $\sqrt{6}$ as $\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3}$ shows that it is possible to cancel a $\sqrt{3}$ top and bottom
Also, simplify $\sqrt{4}$ to $2$
This gives $\frac{\sqrt{2}\cdot2\cdot\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{5}\cdot\sqrt{7}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{35}}$
Finally, to rationalize the denominator, multiply top and bottom by $\sqrt{35}$ to get $\boxed{\frac{4\sqrt{35}}{35}}$.
Writing out the equations of the circles, we have that:  \begin{align*}
(x-2)^2+(y+1)^2 &= 16 \\
(x-2)^2+(y-5)^2 &= 10
\end{align*}To solve for the common $y$ value of both $A$ and $B$, we can subtract the two equations to find that $(y+1)^2 - (y-5)^2 = 6$
Simplifying gives that $(y+1)^2 - (y-5)^2 = 2y + 1 + 10y - 25 = 12y - 24 = 6,$ so that $y = \frac{30}{12} = \frac {5}2$
Substituting back into either of the above circle equations yields that $(x-2)^2 = \frac{15}{4}$
Thus, $x - 2 = \pm \frac{\sqrt{15}}{2}$, so $x = 2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{15}}{2}$
The distance between $A$ and $B$ is simply the difference of their x-coordinates, or $$\left(2 + \frac{\sqrt{15}}{2}\right) - \left(2 - \frac{\sqrt{15}}{2}\right) = \sqrt{15}.$$Thus $(AB)^2=(\sqrt{15})^2=\boxed{15}$.

Evaluate the factors separately: $64^{1/2}=(8^2)^{1/2}=8$, while $27^{-1/3}=\frac{1}{(3^3)^{1/3}}=\frac13$, and $16^{1/4}=(2^4)^{1/4}=2$
Multiply the simplified factors together to obtain the answer of $\boxed{\frac{16}{3}}$.
We have  \[\dfrac{\sqrt[4]{7}}{\sqrt[3]{7}} = \dfrac{7^{\frac14}}{7^{\frac13}} = 7^{\frac14-\frac13} = 7^{-\frac{1}{12}}.\]So, the expression equals 7 raised to the $\boxed{-\frac{1}{12}}$ power.
Since the axis of symmetry is vertical and the vertex is $(5,3)$, the parabola may also be written as  \[y=a(x-5)^2+3\]for some value of $a$
Plugging the point $(2,0)$ into this equation gives  \[0=a(2-5)^2+3=9a+3.\]This tells us $a=-\frac13$.
Our equation is  \[y=-\frac13(x-5)^2+3.\]Putting it $y=ax^2+bx+c$ form requires expanding the square, so we get  \[y=-\frac13(x^2-10x+25)+3={-\frac13 x^2+\frac{10}{3}x-\frac{16}3}.\]Therefore, $a+b+c = \boxed{-\frac73}$.
When using the distributive property, we add the products of 3 and $8x^2$, 3 and $-2x$, and 3 and 1: \begin{align*}
3(8x^2-2x+1) &= 3\cdot 8x^2+3\cdot (-2x) + 3 \cdot 1\\
&= \boxed{24x^2-6x+3}
\end{align*}
Because $-7<-2,$ we use the first case to determine that $f(-7) = 2(-7) + 9 = \boxed{-5}.$
The arithmetic series is $1 + 4 + \cdots + 25 + 28$, with a common difference of 3
Suppose there are $n$ terms in the series
Then 28 is the $n$th term, so $1 + (n-1)\cdot 3 = 28$
Solving, we get $n = 10$
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(1 + 28)/2 \cdot 10 = \boxed{145}$.
By considering the expression $\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the roots of $ax^2+bx+c$, we find that the roots are real and distinct if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is positive
So the roots of $x^2+mx+4$ are real and positive when $m^2-4(1)(4) > 0$
Simplifying and factoring the left-hand side, we find $(m-4)(m+4) > 0$, which implies $m\in \boxed{(-\infty,-4)\cup (4,\infty)}$.
We have \begin{align*}
27^{-\frac13} + 32^{-\frac25} &= \frac{1}{27^{\frac13}} + \frac{1}{32^{\frac25}}\\
&= \frac{1}{(3^3)^{\frac13}} + \frac{1}{(2^5)^{\frac25}}\\
&=\frac{1}{3^1} + \frac{1}{2^2} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{\frac{7}{12}}.
\end{align*}
Let the weight of the puppy be $a$, the weight of the smaller cat be $b$, and the weight of the larger cat be $c$
We have the equations \begin{align*}
a+b+c&=24\\
a+c&=2b\\
a+b&=c
\end{align*} From Equation (2), we have $a=2b-c$
Substituting that into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, we have \begin{align*}
(2b-c)+b+c=24 \Rightarrow b=8
\end{align*} Substituting $a=2b-c$ into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, we have \begin{align*}
(2b-c)+b&=c \Rightarrow 3b=2c
\end{align*} Since $b=8$, $c=\frac{3}{2}b=12$
Finally, substituting the values of $b$ and $c$ into Equation (1) to solve for $a$, we have $a+8+12=24$, or $a=4$
Thus, the puppy weighs $\boxed{4}$ pounds.
We notice that the denominator on the left factors, giving us \[\frac{5x+1}{(2x-1)(x+3)}=\frac{2x}{2x-1}.\]As long as $x\neq\frac12$ we are allowed to cancel $2x-1$ from the denominators, giving \[\frac{5x+1}{x+3}=2x.\]Now we can cross-multiply to find \[5x+1=2x(x+3)=2x^2+6x.\]We simplify this to  \[2x^2+x-1=0\]and then factor to  \[(x+1)(2x-1)=0.\]Notice that since $2x-1$ is in the denominator of the original equation, $x=\frac12$ is an extraneous solution
However $x=\boxed{-1}$ does solve the original equation.
Notice that the last element in row $i$ is equal to $5i$
Thus, the last element in the $9$th row is equal to $5 \times 9 = 45$
The third number in the same row is just two smaller than the last element of the row, so the answer is $45-2 = \boxed{43}$.
Since 2 is not a multiple of 3 or 7, $f(2)=2+3=5$ and we want to find an $a$ where $f^a(2)=5$
So, we keep track of how many times we evaluate $f$ of our previous result until we get 5
\begin{align*}
f(2)&=5\\
f(f(2))&=f(5)=5+3=8 \qquad 5 \text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\\
f(f(f(2)))&=f(8)=8+3=11 \qquad 8 \text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\\
f^4(2)&=11+3=14 \qquad 11 \text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\\
f^5(2)&=3\cdot14=42 \qquad 14 \text{ is a multiple of 7.}\\
f^6(2)&=\frac{42}{21}=2 \qquad 42 \text{ is a multiple of 3 and 7.}\\
f^7(2)&=2+3=5 \qquad 2 \text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}
\end{align*}So the least $a>1$ for which $f^a(2)=f(2)$ is $a=\boxed{7}$.
The sum of the coefficients in $$3(3x^{7} + 8x^4 - 7) + 7(x^5 - 7x^2 + 5)$$(or any polynomial) can be found by plugging in $x = 1$
Then, we have $$3(3 + 8 - 7) + 7(1 - 7 + 5) = 3 \cdot 4 + 7 \cdot -1 = \boxed{5}.$$
The quadratic $x^2-6x+5$ factors as $(x-5)(x-1)$, so it crosses the $x$-axis at $1$ and $5$
Since the leading coefficient is positive, it opens upwards, and thus the value of the quadratic is negative for $x$ between $1$ and $5$
Thus if $x\le 1$ or $x\ge 5$, we have $|x^2-6x+5|=x^2-6x+5$
We can solve the system in this range by setting the $y$-values equal, so
\begin{align*}
x^2-6x+5&=\frac{29}{4}-x\\
x^2-5x+\frac{20}{4}-\frac{29}{4}&=0\\
x^2-5x-\frac{9}{4}&=0.
\end{align*}Thus by the quadratic formula, $$x=\frac{-(-5)\pm\sqrt{(-5)^2-4(\frac{-9}{4})(1)}}{2(1)}=\frac{5\pm\sqrt{25+9}}{2}=\frac{5\pm\sqrt{34}}{2}.$$A quick check shows that both solutions have either $x<1$ or $x>5$, so they are both valid in this system
We do not need to find the corresponding $y$-values since the problem asks only for the sum of the $x$-coordinates.
If $1\le x\le 5$, we know $|x^2-6x+5|=-x^2+6x-5$
Solving the system as before, we have
\begin{align*}
\frac{29}{4}-x&=-x^2+6x-5\\
x^2-7x+\frac{29}{4}+\frac{20}{4}&=0\\
x^2-7x+\frac{49}{4}&=0\\
(x-\frac{7}{2})^2&=0\\
x&=\frac{7}{2}.
\end{align*}Checking, this value is indeed between $1$ and $5$, so it is allowable
Thus the possible $x$-values are $\frac{5+\sqrt{34}}{2}$, $\frac{5-\sqrt{34}}{2}$, and $\frac{7}{2}$
Their sum is $$\frac{5+\sqrt{34}}{2}+\frac{5-\sqrt{34}}{2}+\frac{7}{2}=\frac{5+5+7}{2}=\boxed{\frac{17}{2}}.$$
We begin by solving for $x$ from the first equation $\log_6 (4x)=2$
Expressing this in exponential form, we find that $4x=6^2$, giving us $x=\frac{6^2}{4}=9$
After plugging this value of $x$ into $\log_x 27$, we end up with the expression $\log_9 27$
Since $27=(9)(3)=(9^1)(9^{\frac12})=9^{\frac32}$, we see that $\log_9 27=\boxed{\frac32}$.
Since $3$ is the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $3.2,$ we have that $\lfloor 3.2\rfloor = \boxed{3}.$
Adding the equations, we get
$$2x=8\Rightarrow x=4.$$Substituting this into the first equation, we get
$$4+y=1+5-y\Rightarrow y=1.$$Thus the ordered pair is $\boxed{(4,1)}$.
We start by completing the square
\[x^2-10x+24=(x-5)^2-1.\] Since the square of a real number is at least 0, $(x-5)^2\ge 0$ and $(x-5)^2-1 \ge -1.$ Thus, the minimum value of the quadratic is $-1,$ which occurs when $x=\boxed{5}.$
First, subtract $4x$ from both sides and divide by 2 to write the given line in slope intercept form
This gives $y=-2x+4$
The slope of this line is $-2$
So, we need to find a line with a slope of $-2$ that passes through the point $(0,1)$
Writing this requirement in point-slope form gives the line $y-1=-2x$, or equivalently, $\boxed{y=-2x+1}.$
Combining the fractions on the left gives $\dfrac{2t-2}{t+2} = 3$
Multiplying both sides by $t+2$ gives $2t-2 = 3(t+2)$
Expanding the right side gives $2t-2 = 3t+6$
Subtracting $2t$ and 6 from both sides gives $t=\boxed{-8}$.
The first thing to be addressed is the fractions under the inner sets of ceiling functions
The smallest integer greater than $\frac{27}{17}$ is $2$
The smallest integer greater than $\frac{7\cdot17}{27}$, which is equal to $\frac{119}{27}$ is $5$
Therefore, the original problem can be rewritten as: \[\frac{\left\lceil\frac{17}{7}-2\right\rceil}{\left\lceil\frac{27}{7}+5\right\rceil}=\frac{\left\lceil\frac{3}{7}\right\rceil}{\left\lceil\frac{62}{7}\right\rceil}\] The smallest integer greater than $\frac{3}{7}$ is $1$ and the smallest integer greater than $\frac{62}{7}$ is $9$
Hence, the final simplified fraction is $\boxed{\frac{1}{9}}$.
Let $x=\log_2\frac{1}{16}$
Then, we must have $2^x = \frac{1}{16} = 2^{-4}$, so $x=\boxed{-4}$.
Looking at the form of the equation, we see that we have two linear terms and their product
We thus apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick
The given equation rearranges to $14mn + 7m +2n +1 = 56$, which can be factored to $(7m + 1)(2n +1) = 56 = 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 7$
Since $n$ is a positive integer, we see that $2n +1 > 1$ is odd
Examining the factors on the right side, we see we must have $2n + 1 = 7$, implying $7m+1 = 2^3$
Solving, we find that $(m,n) = \boxed{(1,3)}$.
An $x$-intercept occurs when $y=0$
So, the $x$-intercepts are the solutions to the equation $0 = (x-5)(x^2+5x+6)$
From this equation, we see that solutions occur when $x-5=0$ and when $x^2+5x+6=0$
Now, $x^2+5x+6$ factors to $(x+3)(x+2)$
So, the solutions are $5, -2, -3$, which comes to $\boxed{3}$ intercepts.
We use the distributive property to find \begin{align*}
&(2t^2 -3t+2)(-3t^2 + t-5)\\
&=2t^2(-3t^2 + t-5) -3t(-3t^2 + t-5) + 2(-3t^2 + t-5)\\
&=(-6t^4 + 2t^3-10t^2) +(9t^3 - 3t^2+15t) + (-6t^2 + 2t-10)\\
&=-6t^4 + (2+9)t^3 + (-10 -3 -6)t^2 + (15+2)t - 10\\
&=\boxed{-6t^4 +11t^3 -19t^2 +17t -10}.
\end{align*}
Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we have $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16$, which indicates that the fastest way to solve this problem would be to complete the square
Thus, we have $(x-2)^2=16$, or $x-2=\pm4$, or $x=6$ and $x=-2$
Since $a\geq b$, we now know that $a=6$ and $b=-2$, so $2a+b=2(6)-2=\boxed{10}$.
First, we try to simplify like terms
We find the prime factorizations of $45$ and $360$: $45 = 3^2 \cdot 5$ and $360 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$
Hence, $$\sqrt{45} = \sqrt{3^2 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5}$$and \begin{align*}
\sqrt{360} &= \sqrt{2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5}\\
&= \sqrt{(2 \cdot 3)^2} \cdot \sqrt{2 \cdot 5} = 6 \sqrt{2 \cdot 5}.
\end{align*}Returning to the given expression,  \begin{align*}
3\sqrt{5} - 2\sqrt{5} + \frac{6 \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} &= 3\sqrt{5} - 2\sqrt{5} + 6\sqrt{5}\\
&= 7\sqrt{5} = \sqrt{7^2 \cdot 5} = \sqrt{245}.
\end{align*}Thus, $N = \boxed{245}$.
Expanding the left side of the given equation, we have $x^2-x-6=14 \Rightarrow x^2-x-20=0$
Since in a quadratic  with equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ the product of the roots is $c/a$, the product of the roots of the given equation is $-20/1 = \boxed{-20}$.
The problem simplifies slightly if we notice that $3\sqrt{5} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = \sqrt{45}$, and $2\sqrt{11} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 11} = \sqrt{44}$
Writing the denominator this way, we have \[
\frac{2}{\sqrt{45} + \sqrt{44}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{45} + \sqrt{44}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{45} - \sqrt{44}}{\sqrt{45} - \sqrt{44}} = 2(\sqrt{45} - \sqrt{44}),
\]since $45 - 44 = 1$ so the denominator is just 1
Rewriting what's left in simplest radical form again, we have $6 \sqrt{5} - 4 \sqrt{11}$
Since $5 < 11$, we have $B = 5$, and filling in the rest, $A = 6$, $C = -4$, $D = 11$, and $E = 1$ (since there is no denominator, we just take it to be 1)
Thus $A+B+C+D+E = \boxed{19}$.
First, complete square as follows: $$y=3x^2+6x+9=3\left(x^2+2x\right)+9.$$ To complete the square, we need to add $\left(\frac{2}{2}\right)^2=1$ after the $2x.$ So we have $$y+3=3\left(x^2+2x+1\right)+9.$$ This gives $$y=3\left(x+1\right)^2+6.$$ Now, since $\left(x+1\right)^2\ge0,$ the minimum value is when the squared term is equal to $0.$ So the minimum value is $$y=3\left(x+1\right)^2+6=3\cdot0+6=\boxed{6}.$$
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $\dfrac{-2 + 33}{2} \cdot 8 = \boxed{124}$.
We consider two cases, $x$ is nonnegative (so $|x| = x$), and $x$ is negative (so $|x| = -x$).
When $x\ge 0,$ the equation becomes $x^2-2x-1=0$
Applying the quadratic formula gives $ x=1\pm\sqrt{2}.$  However, $x$ must be nonnegative in this case, so we have $x = 1+\sqrt{2}$.
When $x<0,$ the equation becomes $x^2+2x+1=0$, so $(x+1)^2 = 0$ and $x=-1$.
Thus, the smallest value of $x$ is $x=\boxed{-1}.$
We have two equations and two variables, so it's possible to solve for $m$ and $n$ directly and then calculate $|m-n|$ to get our answer
However, doing so is messy, so we look for an alternative approach
We square the second equation to get $(m+n)^2 = m^2 + 2mn + n^2 = 25$
Since $mn=4$, we can subtract $4mn = 16$ to get $$m^2 -2mn +n^2 = 9\Longrightarrow (m-n)^2=9$$ This implies that $m-n =\pm3$, so $|m-n|=\boxed{3}$.
We see that $f(f(x)) = -\dfrac{1}{-\frac{1}{x}} = x$, therefore $f(f(f(f(f(6))))) = f(f(f(6))) = f(6) = \boxed{-\dfrac{1}{6}}.$
Setting $h$ to zero, we find the following: \begin{align*}
0& = -16t^2 - 24t + 160\\
& = 2t^2 +3t - 20\\
& = (2t-5)(t+4)\\
\end{align*}The negative value of $t$ is extraneous, so we are left with $t=\boxed{2.5}$
We can first rewrite the term under the fifth root: $x\sqrt{x^3} = x \cdot x^{3/2} = x^{5/2}$
Then we simplify the entire expression on the left side of the equation, which gives  $\sqrt[5]{x^{5/2}}=(x^{5/2})^{1/5} = x ^{(5/2)\cdot(1/5)} = x^{1/2}$
We now have $\sqrt{x}=3$ and we can square each side to find $x=\boxed{9}$.
From the first term to the 20th term, the common difference is added 19 times
Therefore, the common difference for the arithmetic sequence is $(59-2)/19=3$
The fifth term is $2+3\cdot(5-1)=\boxed{14}$.
Let $x$ be the number of paperclips that a box with a volume of 48 $\text{cm}^3$ could hold
Setting up the ratio $\frac{50}{16}=\frac{x}{48}$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=150$
Hence, a 48 $\text{cm}^3$ box could hold $\boxed{150}$ paperclips
We also could have noted that tripling the size of the box triples the number of paperclips we can hold, so the new box can hold $50\cdot 3 = 150$ paperclips.
We simply distribute the $4$ to get $4x^4 + 12x^2 + 4.$ Then, the sum of the squares of the coefficients is $4^2 + 12^2 + 4^2 = \boxed{176}.$
Note that the constant term $4$ is indeed a coefficient: it is the coefficient of $x^0$.
The vertex of the parabola is $(5,-4)$, so the equation of the parabola is of the form \[x = a(y + 4)^2 + 5.\] The parabola passes through the point $(3,-2)$
Substituting these values into the equation above, we get \[3 = a(-2 + 4)^2 + 5.\] Solving for $a$, we find $a = -1/2$
Hence, the equation of the parabola is given by \[x = -\frac{1}{2} (y + 4)^2 + 5 = -\frac{1}{2} (y^2 + 8y + 16) + 5 = -\frac{1}{2} y^2 - 4y - 3.\] The answer is $-1/2 - 4 - 3 = \boxed{-\frac{15}{2}}$.
Plugging in $x = 2$, we get $-4$ for the numerator, and $-1$ for the denominator, thus, $\boxed{4}$ is the answer.
Since 8 apples cost the same as four bananas, we see that 16 apples cost the same as 8 bananas
Similarly, 2 bananas cost the same as 3 cucumbers, so 8 bananas cost the same as 12 cucumbers
Hence, 16 apples have the same price as $\boxed{12}$ cucumbers.
If Chewbacca loses one pack of cherry gum, the ratio of the number of pieces of cherry gum he has to the number of pieces of grape gum is $(20-x)/30$
If he instead finds 5 packs of grape gum, this ratio will be $20/(30+5x)$
These ratios must be equal, so we must have  \begin{align*}
\frac{20-x}{30} &= \frac{20}{30+5x} \quad\implies\\
(20-x)(30+5x)& = (30)(20) \quad\implies\\
(20-x)(5)(6+x) &= (30)(20).\end{align*}Dividing both sides by 5 gives $$(20-x)(6+x) = (30)(4)$$and expanding the left side of this gives $$120+14x -x^2 = 120.$$Therefore, $x^2-14x=0$, so $x(x-14)=0$
We can't have $x=0$, so we must have $x=\boxed{14}$.
Writing the equation in exponential form gives $12^2=3x$
Since $3x=144$, $x=\boxed{48}$.
For a quadratic to have two real roots, the discriminant must be greater than 0
So we require \begin{align*}15^2-4 \cdot 8 \cdot c &> 0 \\ \Rightarrow \quad 225-32c &> 0 \\ \Rightarrow \quad c&< \frac{225}{32}.\end{align*}The largest integer smaller than $\frac{225}{32}$ is 7
Thus, the positive integer values of $c$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and their product is $\boxed{5040}$.
Letting $y=0$ in $3x+5y=20$ gives $3x=20$, so the $x$-coordinate of the $x$-intercept is $20/3$
So, the $x$-intercept is $\boxed{\left(\frac{20}{3},0\right)}$.
If the line $x+y=b$ intersects the midpoint, which is: $$\left(\frac{2+4}{2},\frac{5+9}{2}\right)=(3,7)$$This point lies on the line $x+y=b$, so we must have $3+7=b$
Thus, $b=\boxed{10}$.
If $4x^2 - 12x + a$ is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $2x+b$ for some number $b$, since $(2x)^2 = 4x^2$
So, we compare $(2x+b)^2$ to $4x^2 - 12x + a$
Expanding $(2x+b)^2$ gives \[(2x+b)^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.\]Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $4x^2 - 12x+a$, we have $4bx=-12x$, so $b=-3$
Thus, $a=b^2 = \boxed{9}$.
The graph is symmetric with respect to both coordinate axes, and in the first quadrant it coincides with the graph of the line $3x + 4y = 12.$ Therefore the region is a rhombus, and the area is \[
\text{Area} = 4\left(\frac{1}{2}(4\cdot 3)\right) = \boxed{24}.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by $3jk$ to clear the denominator gives $3k + 3j = jk$
Re-arranging and applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, it follows that $$jk - 3j - 3k + 9 = (j-3)(k-3) = 9.$$ Thus, $j-3$ and $k-3$ are pairs of positive factors of $9$, so $(j-3,k-3) = (1,9),(3,3),(9,1)$
These give $k = 4,6,12$, and their sum is $4 + 6 + 12 = \boxed{22}$.
Using the definition given in the problem, we have $A^2+5^2=169=13^2$
Recognizing this as Pythagorean Theorem for a 5-12-13 right triangle, $A=\boxed{12}$.
Factoring the numerator and denominator, we have:
$\displaystyle \frac{2+4-8+16+32-64}{4+8-16+32+64-128}=\frac{2(1+2-4+8+16-32)}{4(1+2-4+8+16-32)}=\frac{2}{4}=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
The length of each side of the room is $\sqrt{225}=15$ feet, or $15\cdot12=180$ inches
Since each tile has a length of 6 inches, each row needs $180/6=\boxed{30}$ tiles.
To get from $5^x$ to $5^{x+2}$, we may multiply by $5^2$
Multiplying the right-hand side of the given equation by $5^2$ we obtain $5^{x+2}=\boxed{2500}$.
Since $2^3=8$ and $3^3=27$, we know that $2<\sqrt[3]{10}<3$
Then we find that $5^3=125$ and $6^3=216$, so $5<\sqrt[3]{200}<6$
We have $\sqrt[3]{10}<3$ and $5<\sqrt[3]{200}$
The whole numbers between $\sqrt[3]{10}$ and $\sqrt[3]{200}$ are $3,4,5$, for a total of $\boxed{3}$ whole numbers.
Let the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_1$ be $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{100}$
Then, by the midpoint formula, the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_2$ are $\frac{x_1+x_2}2,\frac{x_2+x_3}2,\ldots,\frac{x_{100}+x_1}2 $
The sum of these equals $\frac{2x_1+2x_2+\cdots +2x_{100}}2=x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_{100}$
Similarly, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$ equals the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of  $P_2$
Thus the desired answer is $\boxed{2009}$.
Since $(1,2)$ is on the graph of $y=\frac{f(x)}2$, we know that $$2 = \frac{f(1)}{2},$$which implies that $f(1)=4$
Therefore, $f^{-1}(4)=1$, which implies that $\left(4,\frac12\right)$ is on the graph of $y=\frac{f^{-1}(x)}{2}$
The sum of this point's coordinates is $\boxed{\frac 92}$.
The key to this problem is noticing that $235^2 - 221^2$ factors into $(235+221)(235-221)$
So, our fraction becomes $\frac{(235+221)(235-221)}{14} = \frac{456 \cdot 14}{14}$, which simplifies to $\boxed{456}$.
We note that $361=19^2$ and $36=6^2$, so $x=19^2+2(19)(6)+6^2$
This is just the binomial expansion of $(19+6)^2=25^2=\boxed{625}$.
First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-7x+1=8x^2+5x+1$
Combine like terms to get $6x^2+12x=0$
Then, we can divide by $6$ to get $x^2+2x=0$
To complete the square, we need to add $\left(\dfrac{2}{2}\right)^2=1$ to both sides, giving $(x+1)^2=1$.
So we have $x+1=\pm1$
Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $0$
Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\boxed{(-2, 23)}$ and $\boxed{(0, 1)}$.
This is the sum of the series $a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_{10}$ with $a_1 = \frac{2}{3}$ and $r = \frac{2}{3}$.
Thus,  \begin{align*}
S &= \frac{a(1-r^{n})}{1-r}= \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1-\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{10}}{1-\frac{2}{3}}\\
& = \frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{1-\frac{1024}{59049}}{\frac{1}{3}}=\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{3}{1}\cdot\frac{58025}{59049}=\frac{2\cdot58025}{59049}\\
& = \boxed{\frac{116050}{59049}}.
\end{align*}
Since $\dfrac{b}{a} \cdot \dfrac{c}{b} = \dfrac{c}{a}$, we simply multiply the reciprocals of $a \div b$ and $b \div c$ together: $(1/2)(4/3) = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
Since $4096=2^{12}$, one of these is an integer if the number on the root is a factor of 12
Therefore, the only numbers in the list that are integers are $\sqrt{4096}=2^6=64$, $\sqrt[3]{4096}=2^4=16$, $\sqrt[4]{4096}=2^3=8$, $\sqrt[6]{4096}=2^2=4$ and $\sqrt[12]{4096}=2$
This makes $\boxed{5}$ integers in all.
Starting with $2^6\cdot3^3\cdot11^3$, the cube root of that expression is $2^{6/3}\cdot3^{3/3}\cdot11^{3/3}$, which is $2^2\cdot3\cdot11=\boxed{132}$.
Setting $x = 3,$ we get $f(3) = -1.$ Since $-1 < 2,$ $f(-1) = -a + b.$ Hence, $f(f(3)) = f(-1) = -a + b.$ But $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x,$ so $-a + b = 3.$
Setting $x = 4,$ we get $f(4) = -4.$ Since $-4 < 2,$ $f(-4) = -4a + b.$ Hence, $f(f(4)) = f(-4) = -4a + b.$ But $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x,$ so $-4a + b = 4.$
Subtracting the equations $-a + b = 3$ and $-4a + b = 4,$ we get $3a = -1,$ so $a = -1/3.$ From $-a + b = 3,$ we get $b = a + 3 = 8/3.$ Hence, $$a + b = (-1/3) + 8/3 = \boxed{\frac{7}{3}}.$$
$7^{4x-3}$ can be written as $7^{4x}\cdot 7^{-3}$
Since we know that $7^{4x}=343$, we have $7^{4x-3}=343\cdot 7^{-3}=343\cdot \frac{1}{343}=\boxed{1}$.
Let $2^x=a$ and $3^y=b$
Since $2^{x+2}=2^2(2^x)$ and $3^{y+1}=3(3^y)$, the equations become
\begin{align*}
a+b&=5,\\
4a+3b&=18.
\end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by $3$ and subtracting it from the second equation, we find $a=\boxed{3}$ and $b = 2$
Plugging these into the original equations, we find this works.
If $n$ is even, then we can write $n = 2m$ for some integer $m$
Substituting, $$\left \lfloor (2m)^2/4 \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor (2m)/2 \right\rfloor^2 = m^2 - m^2 = 0.$$Hence, $n$ must be odd; we can write $n = 2m+1$ for some integer $m$
Substituting,   \begin{align*}
&\left \lfloor (2m+1)^2/4 \right
\rfloor - \left\lfloor (2m+1)/2 \right\rfloor^2\\
&\qquad= \left \lfloor (4m^2 + 4m + 1)/4 \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor (2m+1)/2 \right\rfloor^2 \\
&\qquad= \left\lfloor m^2 + m + \frac 14 \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor m + \frac 12 \right\rfloor^2 \\
&\qquad= m^2 + m - m^2\\
& = m.
\end{align*}Thus, we find $m = 2$ and $n = \boxed{5}$ as the unique integer solution.
$E(a,4,5) = a \cdot 4^2 + 5 = 16a + 5$ and $E(a,6,7) = a \cdot 6^2 + 7 = 36a + 7.$ We set these equal to each other: $16a + 5 = 36a + 7.$ Now we simplify and have $20a=-2$, so $a = \boxed{-\frac{1}{10}}.$
We know that $(x + y)^2 = (x^2 + y^2) + 2xy = 25$
We are given that $xy = 6$
So, by substitution, $x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = x^2 + y^2 + 2(6) = 25$
It follows that $x^2 + y^2 = 25 - 12 = \boxed{13}$.
To start removing the radicals, we square both sides of the equation
This gives $$Q^3 = \left(\sqrt{Q^3}\right)^2 = \left(16\sqrt[8]{16}\right)^2 = 256 \cdot \sqrt[4]{16} = 256 \cdot 2 = 512.$$Thus, $Q = \sqrt[3]{512} = \sqrt[3]{2^9} = \boxed{8}.$
Let $x=\log_432$
Then, we must have $4^x = 32$
Writing both 4 and 32 with 2 as the base gives $(2^2)^x = 2^5$, so $2^{2x} = 2^5$
Therefore, we must have $2x =5$, so $x =\boxed{\frac{5}{2}}$.
The only way $|3x+5|$ is not positive is if it is 0
We have $|3x+5| = 0$ if and only if $3x+5 = 0$
Solving this equation gives $x = \boxed{-\frac{5}{3}}$.
Substitute in the given numbers
We have $5p-5-125i=10000$, so $5p=10005+125i$, thus $p=\boxed{2001+25i}$.
The graphs intersect when the $y$-values at a particular $x$ are equal
We can find this by solving \[3-x^2+x^3=1+x^2+x^3.\]This simplifies to  \[2(x^2-1)=0.\]This has two solutions, at $x=1$ and $x=-1$
The $y$-coordinates for these points are  \[1+1^2+1^3=3\]and \[1+(-1)^2+(-1)^3=1.\]The difference between these values is $\boxed{2}$.
We rearrange the given equation to $|x-7| = 1$
Thus either $x-7 = 1$, meaning $x = 8$, or $x-7 = -1$, meaning $x=6$
Our answer is therefore $6\cdot 8 = \boxed{48}$.
We complete the square for the first equation by observing that the first equation is equivalent to \[
(x^2-10x +25) +(y^2-4y +4)=36,
\] which is also equivalent to \[
(x-5)^2 +(y-2)^2 =6^2.
\] Similarly, the equation for the second circle is \[
(x+7)^2 +(y+3)^2 =3^2.
\] Hence, the centers of the circles are $(5,2)$ and $(-7,-3)$, and the radii of the circles are equal to 6 and 3, respectively
The distance between the points $(5,2)$ and $(-7,-3)$ by the distance formula is $\sqrt{(5-(-7))^2+(2-(-3))^2}=\sqrt{12^2+5^2}=\sqrt{169}=13$
Therefore, to find the shortest distance between the two circles, we must subtract from $13$ the sum of the radii of the two circles
Thus, the shortest distance between the circles is $13-3-6 = \boxed{4}$.
The function $|x|$ is difficult to deal with directly
Instead we work by cases: $x\geq0$ and $x<0$.
If $x\geq0$ then $|x|=x$, and we can find the difference by subtracting  \[x-(-x^2-3x-2)=x^2+4x+2=(x+2)^2-2.\]This function is always increasing as $x$ varies over the nonnegative numbers, so this is minimized at $x=0$
The minimum value on $x\geq0$ is  \[(0 + 2)^2 - 2 = 2.\]If $x<0$ then $|x|=-x$ and we can find the difference by subtracting: \[(-x)-(-x^2-3x-2)=x^2+2x+2=(x+1)^2+1.\]This quadratic is minimized at $x=-1$, and the minimum value is  \[(-1+1)^2+1=1.\]Since the minimum value on negative numbers is less than the minimum value on the nonnegative numbers, the minimum value for the difference is $\boxed{1}$.
We complete the square:  \begin{align*}
6j^2 - 4j + 12 &= 6\left(j^2 - \frac{2}{3} j\right) + 12 \\
&= 6\left(j^2 - \frac{2}{3} j + \frac{1}{9}\right) + 12 - \frac{6}{9} \\
&= 6\left(j - \frac{1}{3} \right)^2 + \frac{34}{3}
\end{align*}Then $q = \frac{34}{3}$ and $p = - \frac{1}{3}$
The question asks for $\frac{q}{p}$, which is equal to $\boxed{-34}$.
We know the following two equations: \begin{align*}
1\text{ bush} &= 8\text{ containers}\\
5\text{ containers} &= 2\text{ zucchinis}.
\end{align*} To find the value of 48 zucchinis in terms of bushes, we multiply by fractions equal to 1 where the numerator and denominator are in different units, canceling units as we go
Thus, we set up the following equation to find our answer: $48\text{ zucchinis} = 48\text{ zucchinis}\times \frac{5\text{ containers}}{2\text{ zucchinis}}\times\frac{1 \text{ bush}}{8\text{ containers}}=\boxed{15} \text{ bushes}$.
As an equation, $\frac 1m + \frac 1n = \frac 14$
Multiplying both sides by $4mn$ to clear out the denominators gives $4n + 4m = mn$
Re-arranging and applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, it follows that  $$mn - 4m - 4n + 16 = (m-4)(n-4) = 16.$$Thus, $m-4$ and $n-4$ are pairs of factors of $16$; to satisfy the positive condition, both factors must also be positive
Then, $$(m-4,n-4) = (1,16),(2,8),(4,4),(8,2),(16,1),$$yielding $\boxed{5}$ distinct ordered pairs.
Using dimensional analysis, we have $\dfrac{1\mbox{ mile}}{24\mbox{ min}} \times 10\mbox{ min} = \dfrac{5}{12}$ miles, or $\boxed{0.4\mbox{ miles}}$ to the nearest tenth.
We complete the square by observing that the equation for the circle is equivalent to  \[(x^2-24x+144) +(y^2+10y+25) -9 =0,\] which is also equivalent to \[(x-12)^2 +(y+5)^2=3^2.\] Hence the center of the circle is $(12,-5)$ and by the Pythagorean theorem, the distance from the origin to the center of the circle is $13$ (we can also recall that we have a $5-12-13$ triangle)
Since the radius of the circle is $3$, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is the difference of the distance from the center of the circle to the origin less the radius which is $13-3=\boxed{10}$.
We rewrite the equation as $x^2 + 14x + y^2 - 4y = 10$ and then complete the square, resulting in  $(x+7)^2-49 + (y-2)^2-4=10$, or $(x+7)^2+(y-2)^2=63$
This is the equation of a circle with center $(-7, 2)$ and radius $\sqrt{63},$ so the area of this region is $\pi r^2 = \boxed{63\pi}$.
The first term is $3$, and the ratio between terms is $(9/2)/3=3/2$
Therefore, the eighth term of the sequence is $3\cdot(3/2)^{8-1} = 3^8/2^7 = \boxed{\frac{6561}{128}}$.
We substitute $a=x^y$ and $b=y^x$ to form the equations
\begin{align*}
a+1&=b,\\
2a &=b+7.
\end{align*}
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we obtain $a-1=7$, so $a=8$.
Substituting this into the first equation, we find $b=9$.
We see from $x^y=8$ and $y^x=9$ that the solution is $(x,y)=\boxed{(2,3)}$.
Note that $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} >0$ for all nonzero $x$
That is, the range of $f$ must only include positive numbers
Conversely, if $a$ is a positive number, then \[f\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\right)=\frac{1}{(1/\sqrt{a})^2} = a,\]so $a$ is indeed in the range of $f$
Thus, the range of $f$ is the set of all positive real numbers; in interval notation, that's $\boxed{(0,\infty)}$.
Using the difference of squares factorization, we have  \begin{align*}
15^4+2\times15^2+1-14^4&=(15^2+1)^2-(14^2)^2 \\
&=(15^2+1-14^2)(15^2+1+14^2)\\
&=(15^2-14^2+1)(422)\\
&=((15-14)(15+14)+1)(2\cdot 211)\\
&=30\cdot2\cdot211.
\end{align*}Since $211$ is a prime and is larger than the other factor, we see that $\boxed{211}$ is the largest prime factor.
The series has first term $\frac{3}{2}$ and common ratio $\frac{-4}{9}$, so the formula yields: $\cfrac{\frac{3}{2}}{1-\left(\frac{-4}{9}\right)}=\boxed{\frac{27}{26}}$.
Call the coordinates of point $B$ $(x,y)$
Because the coordinates of a midpoint of a line segment are the average of the coordinates of the two endpoints, we have that $\frac{3+x}{2} = 2$ and $\frac{1+y}{2} = 5$
Solving for $x$ and $y$ yields $x = 1$ and $y = 9$
Thus, point $B$ has coordinates $(1,9)$, so the product of its coordinates is $\boxed{9}$.
First, notice that $4096=4^6$
We can begin simplifying from the innermost square root: $$\sqrt{\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{\sqrt{4096}}}}=\sqrt{\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{64}}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4}}=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$$
Let $p$ and $q$ be two primes that are roots of $x^2 - 63 x + k = 0$
Then $$
x^2 - 63 x + k = (x - p)(x - q) = x^2 - (p+q)x + p \cdot q,
$$ so $p + q = 63$ and $p\cdot q=k$
Since $63$ is odd, one of the primes must be $2$ and the other $61$
Thus, there is exactly $\boxed{1}$ possible value for $k$, namely $k = p\cdot q = 2\cdot 61=122$.
We have $2 \diamondsuit 7 = 3(2)+5(7) = 6+35 = \boxed{41}$.
If we multiply $(x^2 - k)$ by $(x + k)$, we get $x^3 + kx^2 - kx - k^2$
We can now factor out a $k$ from the last three terms of this expression, which gives us $x^3 + k(x^2 - x - k)$
When we set this equal to the right side of the original equation $x^3 + k(x^2 -x - 5)$, we get $x^3 + k(x^2 - x - k) = x^3 + k(x^2 - x - 5)$
A careful comparison of the two sides of this equation reveals that $k$ must be 5 (consider the constant terms)
Alternatively, we could multiply out both sides of the equation and get $x^3 + kx^2 - kx - k^2 = x^3 + kx^2 - kx - 5k$
The left side and the right side are the exact same when $k^2 = 5k$, so $k = \boxed{5}$.
We want to evaluate the arithmetic series $100 + 101 + \cdots + 999$
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms
The total number of three-digit integers is $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$, so the sum is $(100 + 999)/2 \cdot 900 = \boxed{494550}$.
If $2x^2 + 5x + b = 0$ has two rational solutions, then its discriminant, $5^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot b = 25 - 8b$, must be a perfect square
Since $b$ is positive, it follows that $25 - 8b \ge 0 \Longrightarrow b \in \{1,2,3\}$
Checking each one, we see that $b = 2$ and $b = 3$ indeed work, and their sum is $2 + 3 = \boxed{5}$.
We have  \begin{align*}
&(2x^2 + 7x - 3) - (x^2 + 5x - 12) \\
&\qquad = 2x^2 + 7x - 3 - x^2 - 5x + 12\\
&\qquad = (2x^2 - x^2) +(7x-5x) +(12-3)\\
&\qquad = \boxed{x^2+2x+9}.
\end{align*}
Rearranging the terms, we find that this is equal to $26\times(33+67)=26\times(100)=\boxed{2600}$.
When using the distributive property, we add the product of $9x$ and $2x^2$ to the product of 4 and $2x^2$:\begin{align*}
(9x+4)\cdot 2x^2 &= 9x\cdot 2x^2+4\cdot 2x^2\\
&= \boxed{18x^3+8x^2}.
\end{align*}

Then $|f(a)-a|$ is the vertical distance from the green to the red graph at $x=a$
We can see that this distance varies from $0$ to $1$, inclusive of $0$ but not of $1$ (since the hollow dots on the graph of $y=f(x)$ represent points which are not part of the graph)
Let $a$ be the first term in the arithmetic sequence, and let $d$ be the common difference
The sixteenth term is $a + 15d = 8$, and the seventeenth term is $a + 16d = 10$, so the common difference is $d = 10 - 8 = 2$.
Substituting into the equation $a + 15d = 8$, we get $a + 30 = 8$, so $a = -22$
Then the second term is $a + d = -22 + 2 = \boxed{-20}$.
Notice that $98 = 100-2$ and $102 = 100+2$
Their product is thus $(100-2)(100+2)$, which is the same as $100^2 - 2^2$
This is easily computable as $10000 - 4 = \boxed{9996}$.
By factoring the denominator, the equation becomes $\frac{x-1}{(x-1)(x+7)}$
So the denominator equals $0$ when $x=1$ and $x=-7$
However, since the term $x-1$ also exists in the numerator and is of the same degree as in the denominator, $x=1$ is not a vertical asymptote
Therefore, the equation has only $\boxed{1}$ vertical asymptote at $x=-7$.
Writing the right hand side with 2 as the base, we have $4^{x-4} = (2^2)^{x-4} = 2^{2(x-4)} = 2^{2x-8}$, so our equation is $$2^{x^2-3x-2} = 2^{2x - 8}.$$Then, by setting the exponents equal to each other, we obtain $$x^2 - 3x - 2 = 2x - 8.$$This gives the quadratic $$x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.$$Factoring gives $(x-2)(x-3)=0$, which has solutions $x = 2,3$
The sum of these solutions is $\boxed{5}$.
We just follow the flowchart
First, we double 10 to get 20
Since 20 is greater than 18, we follow the chart to the right and subtract 5, giving a final output of $\boxed{15}$.
We know that $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$ and $(x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2$
We can see that $(x - y)^2 = (x^2 + 2xy + y^2) - 4xy = (x + y)^2 - 4xy = 45 - 40 = \boxed{5}$.
The value $x=f^{-1}(-31/96)$ is the solution to $f(x)=-31/96$
This means \[\frac{x^5-1}3=\frac{-31}{96}.\]Multiplying by 3 gives \[x^5-1=\frac{-31}{32}.\]If we add 1 we get  \[x^5=\frac{-31}{32}+\frac{32}{32}=\frac1{32},\]and the only value that solves this equation is  \[x=\boxed{\frac12}.\]

We first find the $x$ values at which the two equations intersect
When $x\ge 0$, $y=|x|=x$
Plugging this into the second equation to eliminate $y$, we get $x=-x^2+6\Rightarrow x^2+x-6=0$
Factoring the left hand side gives $(x+3)(x-2)=0$, so $x=2$ (since we stated the $x$ was non-negative)
By symmetry, the $x$ value of the left intersection is $x=-2$
So we just have to consider the integer $x$ values between these two bounds and find all integer $y$ values that make the point $(x,y)$ fall inside the region.
For $x=-2$, there is 1 point that works: $(-2,2)$
For $x=-1$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=1$ and the value of $y=-x^2+6$ is $y=5$, so all $y$ values between 1 and 5 inclusive work, for a total of 5 points
For $x=0$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=0$ and the value of $y=-x^2+6$ is $y=6$, so all $y$ values between 0 and 6 inclusive work, for a total of 7 points
By symmetry, when $x=1$, there are 5 points that work, and when $x=2$, there is 1 point that works.
In total, there are $1+5+7+5+1=\boxed{19}$ lattice points in the region or on the boundary.
Simplify the denominator first to obtain $\frac{5}{\sqrt{125}} = \frac{5}{5\sqrt{5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}}$.
This is a geometric series with 5 terms, a first term of $1/3$, and a common ratio of $-1/3$
The sum of this series is $\frac{\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{3}\cdot(-\frac{1}{3})^5}{1-(-\frac{1}{3})} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}+(\frac{1}{3})^6}{1+\frac{1}{3}}=\boxed{\frac{61}{243}}$.
Let the number of acrobats in the show be $a$ and the number of elephants be $e$
We are looking for the value of $a$
Assuming that each acrobat has 2 legs and 1 head, and that each elephant has 4 legs and 1 head, we can set up the following system of equations:
\begin{align*}
2a+4e &= 40 \\
a + e &= 15 \\
\end{align*}To solve for $a$, we need to eliminate $e$ from the equations above
We can rewrite the second equation above as $e=15-a$, and substituting this into the first equation to eliminate $e$ gives $2a+4(15-a) = 40$, or $a=10$
Thus, there are $\boxed{10}$ acrobats in the circus show.
Since she only needs to make the same amount of money, if she works for 4 times as many weeks, she can work 4 times fewer hours per week, meaning she can work $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 48 = \boxed{12}$ hours per week.
We have  \[\frac14\cdot 2^{30} = \frac{2^{30}}{4} = \frac{2^{30}}{2^2} = 2^{30-2} = 2^{28},\] so $x = \boxed{28}$.
Denote the roots of $5x^2 + 3x +4$ by $a$ and $b$
We have that $\alpha = \frac{1}{a}$ and $\beta = \frac{1}{b}$
So, $$\alpha + \beta = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a + b}{ab}.$$
Now, we know that $a + b = \frac{-3}{5}$ and $ab = \frac{4}{5}$ by the relationship between sum/products of roots and the coefficients of a polynomial.
Hence $\alpha + \beta = \dfrac{a + b}{ab} = \boxed{-\dfrac{3}{4}}$.
Consider the numbers $1, 2, 3,\dots, 10$
Jo would add these integers up as is, while Kate would round the first four down to 0, decreasing her sum by $1+2+3+4=10$, and would round the last six up to 10, increasing her sum by $5+4+3+2+1+0=15$
Thus, her sum is $-10+15=5$ more than Jo's sum for the numbers $1, 2, 3,\dots, 10$
This same logic applies to the numbers $11, 12, 13,\dots, 20$ also, and in general it applies to every ten numbers greater than 20
Since there are five sets of ten numbers from 1 to 50, Kate's sum is $5 \cdot 5 = \boxed{25}$ more than Jo's sum.
The $10^{th}$ square receives $2^{10}=1024$ grains
The first $8$ squares receive $2+2^2+\dots+2^8=2\left(\frac{2^8-1}{2-1}\right)=2(256-1)=2(255)=510$
Thus the $10^{th}$ square receives $1024-510=\boxed{514}$ more grains than the first $8$ combined.
We calculate as follows: $$|\,|{-|{-1+1}|-1}|+1| = \left|\, |0-1|+1\right| = |1+1| = \boxed{2}$$
$\lfloor |{-4.2}| \rfloor = \lfloor 4.2 \rfloor = 4$ because the greatest integer less than $4.2$ is $4$
$|\lfloor -4.2 \rfloor|= |{-5}| = 5$ because the greatest integer less than $-4.2$ is $-5$
Therefore, the answer is $ 4 + 5 = \boxed{9}.$
Consider the quadratic formula $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
Since the quadratic has exactly one root, then its discriminant must be 0
Thus, this gives us  \begin{align*} 0&=b^2-4ac
\\\Rightarrow\qquad0&=(c+1)^2-4c
\\\Rightarrow\qquad0&=(c^2+2c+1)-4c
\\\Rightarrow\qquad0&=c^2-2c+1
\\\Rightarrow\qquad0&=(c-1)^2.
\end{align*}Since this expression is a perfect square, the only possible of value of $c$ is 1
Thus, the product of all possible values of $c$ is $\boxed{1}$.
The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$ is $\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)$.
So, the midpoint of the segment is $\left(\frac{6+0}{2}, \frac{12+(-6)}{2}\right)$, which simplifies to $(3,3)$
The sum of these coordinates is $\boxed{6}$.
Since $\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $\beta$, by definition $\alpha\beta = k$ for some constant $k$
Plugging in, we see that $4\cdot 9 = k$, so $k = 36$
So when $\beta = -72$, we have that $-72\alpha = 36$, or $\alpha = \boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}$.
Factor 2009 out of the numerator: \[
\frac{2009^2-2009}{2009}=\frac{2009(2009-1)}{2009}=\boxed{2008}.
We can split the expression $|x-5|=12$ into two separate cases: $x-5=12$ and $x-5=-12$
For the first case, solving for $x$ would give us $x=12+5=17$
For the second case, we would get $x=-12+5=-7$
Therefore, $x=17$ and $x=-7$ both satisfy the equation
Since the problem asks for the largest value of $x$, our solution is $\boxed{17}$.
Let the two sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$
The problem is now telling us $ab=2a+2b$
Putting everything on one side of the equation, we have $ab-2a-2b=0.$  This looks tricky
However, we can add a number to both sides of the equation to make it factor nicely
4 works here:  $$ab-2a-2b+4=4 \Rightarrow (a-2)(b-2)=4$$Since we don't have a square, $a$ and $b$ must be different
It doesn't matter which one is which, so we can just say $a=6 $ and $b=3 $
The perimeter is then $2(6+3)=\boxed{18}$
The given expression equals $a^{2+5}=a^7$
Plugging in the value of $a$, the expression equals $3^7=\boxed{2187}$.
We have $i^6 = i^4\cdot i^2 = 1\cdot (-1) = -1$
We also have $i^{16} = (i^4)^4 = 1^4 =1$, and $i^{-26} = 1/i^{26} = 1/(i^{24}\cdot i^2) = 1/[1\cdot (-1)] = -1$
So, adding these three results gives $i^6 + i^{16} + i^{-26} = -1+1-1 = \boxed{-1}$.
Let $f$ be the flat fee for the first night and $n$ be the fixed fee for each night thereafter
Notice that the first night is incorporated into the flat fee
We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information as follows:
\begin{align*}
f + 2n &= 155 \\
f + 5n &= 290 \\
\end{align*}It's easiest to eliminate $f,$ solve for $n$ and then solve for $f$ using that value
To solve for $n$, subtract the first equation from the second, obtaining $3n = 135$, or $n = 45$
Substitute for $n$ in the first equation to obtain $f = 155 - 90$, or $f = 65$
Thus, the flat fee for the first night is $\boxed{\$65}$.
In order to find $\log_{625} x$, we must first find $x$
We begin by writing $\log_9 (x-2)=\frac{1}{2}$ in exponential form, which gives us $9^{\frac12}=x-2$
Solving for $x$, we find that $x=9^{\frac12}+2=3+2=5$
After plugging this value of $x$ into the second expression, the final step is to find $\log_{625} 5$
Since we know that $625=5^4$ or $625^{\frac14}=5$, $\log_{625} 5=\boxed{\frac14}$.
Let there be $B$ boys and $G$ girls
Since every member is either a boy or a girl, $B+G=26$
Also, we have $\frac{1}{2}G+B=16$
Multiplying the second equation by $2$, we get $G+2B=32$
Subtracting the first equation from this, we get $B=32-26=6$.
Thus there are $\boxed{6}$ boys on the chess team.
We could write out all of the terms until we get to the tenth term, but instead we can find the formula for the $n$th term in the geometric sequence
Since 9 is the first term and we multiply by $\frac{1}{3}$ to find the next term, we determine that the formula for the geometric sequence is $a_n=9\cdot\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{(n-1)}$
That means $a_{10}=9\cdot\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^9=\frac{3^2}{3^9}=\frac{1}{3^7}=\boxed{\frac{1}{2187}}$.
Since the pressure $p$ of the oxygen and the volume $v$ are inversely proportional, $pv=k$ for some constant $k$
From the first container, we know that $k=2.28\cdot5=11.4$
Consequently, when we move it to the 5.7 liter container, we get that $5.7p=11.4$, so $p=\boxed{2}$.
We are given the equations $a+b+c=99$ and $a+6=b-6=5c$
Solve $b-6=5c$ for $b$ to find $b=5c+6$, and solve $5c=a+6$ for $a$ to find $a=5c-6$
Substituting both of these equations into $a+b+c=99$, we have $(5c-6)+(5c+6)+c=99$
Simplifying the left hand side, we get $11c=99$ which implies $c=9$
Substituting into $b=5c+6$, we have $b=5(9)+6=\boxed{51}$.
Let $p$ be the number of Popsicles Megan can finish in 4 hours and 30 minutes
If we convert that period of time into minutes, we find that 4 hours and 30 minutes is equal to $(4)(60)+30=270$ minutes
From here, we can set up the proportion  \begin{align*} \frac{x}{270}& =\frac{1}{15}
\\\Rightarrow \qquad x& =\left(\frac{1}{15}\right)(270)
\\\Rightarrow \qquad x& =\boxed{18}
\end{align*}
Let $x$ be the larger number and $y$ be the smaller number
Then we have $x+y=12$ and $x-y=20$
If we subtract the second equation from the first, we get $$x+y-(x-y)=12-20\qquad\Rightarrow 2y=-8\qquad\Rightarrow y=-4.$$ The smaller number is $\boxed{-4}$.
The coefficient of $x$ in $3(x - 4) + 4(7 - 2x^2 + 5x) - 8(2x - 1)$ is $3 + 4 \cdot 5 - 8 \cdot 2 = \boxed{7}$.
We have  \[16^{7/4} = (2^4)^{7/4} = 2^{4\cdot (7/4)} = 2^7 = \boxed{128}.\]
We notice that the denominator on the left factors, giving us \[\frac{2x+4}{(x-1)(x+5)}=\frac{2-x}{x-1}.\]As long as $x\neq1$ we are allowed to cancel $x-1$ from the denominators, giving \[\frac{2x+4}{x+5}=2-x.\]Now we can cross-multiply to find \[2x+4=(2-x)(x+5)=-x^2-3x+10.\]We simplify this to  \[x^2+5x-6=0\]and then factor to  \[(x-1)(x+6)=0.\]Notice that since $x-1$ is in the denominator of the original equation, $x=1$ is an extraneous solution
However $x=\boxed{-6}$ does solve the original equation.
$101^2>99^2$, so $|101^2-99^2|=101^2-99^2$
This factors as a difference of squares into $(101-99)(101+99)=2\cdot200=\boxed{400}$.
We have two equations and two variables, so it's possible to solve for $p$ and $q$ directly and then calculate $p^2$ and $q^2$ separately to get our answer
However, doing so involves a fair amount of computation with complex numbers and square roots, so we look for an alternative approach
We square the second equation to get $$(p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 36,$$which is close to what we want but has the extra $2pq$ term
Since we know that $pq=9$, we can substitute to get $$p^2 + 2(9) +q^2 = 36 \implies p^2+q^2 = \boxed{18}.$$Note that our task was made easier by only solving for what the problem asked rather than by trying to solve for $p$ and $q$ individually.
First, we note that $r$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lfloor r \rfloor + r$ is nonpositive
Next, because $\lfloor r \rfloor$ is an integer and $\lfloor r \rfloor + r=12.2$, the decimal part of $r$ must be $0.2$
Therefore, $r=n+0.2$ for some integer $n$, so that $\lfloor r\rfloor =n$ and $\lfloor r \rfloor + r = 2n+0.2 =12.2$
Therefore, $n=6$, and the only value of $r$ that satisfies the equation is $\boxed{r=6.2}$.
The condition $f(f(x))$ means that $f$ is the inverse of itself, so its graph is symmetrical about the line $y = x$
With a rational function of this form, we will have two asymptotes: a vertical one at $x=-d/c$ if $cx+d$ does not divide $ax+b$, and a horizontal one at $y=a/c$, if we take the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ goes to $\pm\infty$
In order for $f$ to be its own inverse, the intersection of the asymptotes must lie on the line $y=x$ so that it and its asymptotes reflect onto themselves
This means that $-d/c=a/c$, and therefore $-d=a$ and $a+d=\boxed{0}$.
Simplify \[
16^3\times 8^3=(2^4)^3\times(2^3)^3=2^{12}\times2^{9}=2^{21}.
\] Then $2^{21}=2^K$ implies $K=\boxed{21}$.
Let the first term be $a$
Because the sum of the series is $16$, we have $16= \frac{a}{1-(-1/5)} = \frac{a}{6/5} = \frac{5a}{6}$
Therefore, $a=\boxed{\frac{96}{5}}$.
First we note that since $n^2-35n = n(n-35)$, and at least one of $n$ and $n-35$ is even, thus $n^2-35n$ is even
So $n^2-35n+306$ is also even
Thus the prime $p$ must equal 2
This means that we want the product of the positive integral solutions to $n^2-35n+306=2$, or $n^2-35n+304=0$.
The problem tells us that there is at least one positive integral solution
Now we use the fact that the product of the solutions to a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $c/a$, which equals 304 in this case
This means that both solutions must in fact be positive, since if only one were, their product would be negative
Additionally, the sum of the solutions is given by $-b/a$, which is 35 in this case
Since one solution is integral, and the sum of both solutions is integral, the other solution is integral as well
So we want the product of both, which is $\boxed{304}$.
Evaluating, $$2 \nabla 5 = \dfrac{2 + 5}{1 + 2 \times 5} = \boxed{\frac{7}{11}}.$$
From the definition of $A\; \clubsuit \;B$, we can rewrite the equation as:
\begin{align*}
A\;\clubsuit \;4=3A+2(4)+5&=58\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 3A+13&=58\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 3A&=45\\
\Rightarrow\qquad A&=15
\end{align*}The final value of $A$ is $\boxed{15}$.
We evaluate $r$ several times to see if there is a pattern
Indeed, $r(\theta) = \frac{1}{1-\theta}$, so \begin{align*}
r(r(\theta)) &= r\left(\frac{1}{1- \theta}\right) = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1-\theta}} \cdot \frac{1 - \theta}{1 - \theta} \\ &= \frac{1 - \theta}{1 - \theta - 1} = \frac{1 - \theta}{- \theta} = 1 - \frac{1}{\theta}.
\end{align*} Then, $$r(r(r(\theta ))) = r\left(1 - \frac 1{\theta}\right) = \frac{1}{1 - \left(1 - \frac 1{\theta}\right)} = \frac{1}{\frac {1}{\theta}} = \theta.$$ Hence, for any $\theta$, we have that $r(r(r(\theta))) = \theta$ is the identity
Then, $$r(r(r(r(r(r(30)))))) = r(r(r(30))) = \boxed{30}.$$
Substituting $f^{-1}(x)$ into our expression for $f$, we get \[\frac{3}{2-f^{-1}(x)}=x.\]Solving for $f^{-1}(x)$, we find that $f^{-1}(x)=2-\frac{3}{x}$, so $f^{-1}(3)=2-\frac{3}{3}=1$
Therefore, $g(3)=\frac{1}{f^{-1}(3)}+9=\frac{1}{1}+9=\boxed{10}$.
We have $(90 + 5)^2 = 90^2 + 2(90)(5) + 5^2 = 8100 + 900 + 25 = \boxed{9025}$.
Multiplying both sides by $x$ and then subtracting $10x$ from each side gives $x^2 - 10 x + 25 = 0.$ The quadratic factors to give $(x-5)^2 = 0,$ so $x-5 = 0,$ and $x=5$ is the only solution
Thus the answer is $\boxed{5}.$
Note: We might want to use the fact that the sum of the solutions to a quadratic $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ is given by $-b/a,$ but be careful! That fact counts double roots twice for the purpose of the sum, but this problem only counts it once, since $x=5$ is the only solution.
If you must score at least $80 \%$, then you cannot miss more than $20 \% = 1/5$ of the problems
$1/5$ of $35$ is equal to $7$, so you can miss at most $\boxed{7}$ problems and still pass.
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$
Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$)
If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$
Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$
Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$
Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions.
135 factors into four possible pairs: $(1,135)$, $(3,45)$, $(5,27)$, and $(9,15)$
The only one of these with difference 6 is $(9,15)$, which has a larger integer of $\boxed{15}$.
$x^2 - y^2$ factors into $(x+y)(x-y)$, so, to obtain the value of $x^2 - y^2$, simply multiply $16 \cdot 2$ to get $\boxed{32}$.
Factoring the quadratic in the numerator does not look pleasant, so we go ahead and multiply through by the denominator to get \begin{align*}
r^2-3r-17&=(r+4)(2r+7)\\
r^2-3r-17&=2r^2 + 15r + 28\\
r^2+18r+45&=0\\
(r+3)(r+15)&=0
\end{align*}Therefore the solutions are $r=-3$ and $r=-15$ which have a difference of $\boxed{12}$.
If we multiply the first equation by $-\frac{3}{2}$, we obtain
$$6y-9x=-\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$, we have
$$-\frac{3}{2}a=b\Rightarrow\frac{a}{b}=\boxed{-\frac{2}{3}}.$$
We don't know $g(x),$ so we don't have an expression we can simply stick $-5$ in to get an answer
We do, however, know that $g(f(x)) = 2x^2 +5x-3.$ So, if we can figure out what to put into $f(x)$ such that $-5$ is output, we can use our expression for $g(f(x))$ to find $g(-5).$   If $f(x) = -5,$ we have $3x-8 = -5,$ so $x = 1.$ Therefore, letting $x=1$ in $g(f(x)) = 2x^2 +5x - 3$ gives \[g(-5) = g(f(1)) =2\cdot 1^2 +5\cdot 1 - 3 = \boxed{4}.\]
Let $u=3x-1$
Then $x=(u+1)/3$, and \begin{align*}
f(u)&=\displaystyle\left(\frac{u+1}{3}\displaystyle\right)^2+\frac{u+1}{3}+1\\
&=\frac{u^2+2u+1}{9}+\frac{u+1}{3}+1\\
&=\frac{u^2+5u+13}{9}.
\end{align*}In particular, \[
f(5)=\frac{5^2+5\cdot5+13}{9} =\frac{63}{9}=\boxed{7}.
First, we simplify the left side, and we have \[2^x+2^x+2^x+2^x = 4\cdot 2^x = 2^2\cdot 2^x = 2^{x+2}.\]Noting that $512 = 2^9$, our equation now is $2^{x+2} = 2^9$, so $x+2 = 9$
Therefore, $x=\boxed{7}$.
This is the square of a binomial: $23^2 + 2(23)(2) + 2^2 = (23+2)^2 = 25^2 = \boxed{625}$.
Working from the inside out, since $2<4$ we have that $f(2)=(2)^2-1=3$
Continuing, since $3<4$ we have that $f(f(2))=f(3)=(3)^2-1=8$
Finally, since $8 \geq 4$ we have that $f(f(f(2)))=f(8)=3(8)-2=\boxed{22}$.
The roots of the equation are given by $\frac{7 \pm \sqrt{7^2 + 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 8}}{2 \cdot 3}$
When taking their difference, the term $7$ in the numerator cancels out, so the difference is $2 \times \frac{\sqrt{7^2 + 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 8}}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{\sqrt{145}}{3}$
Thus, the answer is $145 + 3 = \boxed{148}$.
The car travels at a speed of $$\frac{3}{4}\times80\text{ miles per hour}=3\times20=60\text{ miles per hour}.$$ In $20$ minutes, the car travels $$\frac{60 \text{ miles}}{60\text{ minutes}}\times20\text{ minutes}=1\times20=\boxed{20\text{ miles}}.$$
Since the line passes through $(4,-8)$, we know the equation will be satisfied when we plug in $x=4$ and $y=-8$
This gives
\begin{align*}
a(4)+(a+1)(-8)&=a+2\\
4a-8a-8&=a+2\\
-4a-8&=a+2\\
-10&=5a\\
-2&=a.
\end{align*}Thus $a=\boxed{-2}$
The equation is $-2x-y=0$, or $y=-2x$, and we can see that $(4,-8)$ lies along this line.
Note that if we factor out a 2, then Sean's sum is $2 + 4 + \cdots + 500 = 2(1 + 2 + \cdots + 250)$
Julie's sum is $1 + 2 + \cdots + 250$
So Sean's sum divided by Julie's sum is $$
\frac{2(1 + 2 + \cdots + 250)}{(1 + 2 + \cdots + 250)} = \boxed{2}.
The number of boats built is $3+3\cdot2+3\cdot2^2 = 3+6+12 = \boxed{21}$.
Since $f(x)$ is a linear function, we can write $f(x) = ax + b$
We want to find the inverse function $g(x)$ defined by $f(g(x))=x$ for every $x$
If we substitute $g(x)$ into the equation for $f$ we get  \[f(g(x))=ag(x)+b.\]Using that the left side is $f(g(x))=x$ we get \[x=ag(x)+b.\]Solving for $g$ we obtain \[g(x)=\dfrac{x-b}{a}.\]Substituting $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ into the given equation, we get \[ax + b = 4 \cdot \frac{x-b}{a} + 6\]Multiplying both sides by $a$, we get \[a^2 x + ab = 4x - 4b + 6a.\]For this equation to hold for $\emph{all}$ values of $x$, we must have the coefficient of $x$ on both sides equal, and the two constant terms equal
Setting the coefficients of $x$ equal gives $a^2 = 4$, so $a = \pm2$
Setting constant terms equal gives $ab = -4b + 6a$
If $a = 2$, we have $2b = -4b + 12$, which gives $b = 2$
If $a = -2$, we have $-2b = -4b - 12$, so $b = -6$
Thus we have two possibilities: $f(x) =2x + 2$ or $f(x) = -2x - 6$.
We're given that $f(1) = 4$, and testing this shows that the first function is the correct choice
So finally, $f(2) = 2(2) + 2 = \boxed{6}$.
Either the $y$ coordinate is twice the $x$ coordinate, in which case we have the line $y=2x$, or the $x$ coordinate is twice the $y$ coordinate, in which case we have the line $y=\frac{1}{2}x$
The graph of these two lines is shown below:

The plane is split into $\boxed{4}$ regions.
Let $a,b,c$ be the number of 30 cent items, 2 dollar items, and 3 dollar items that Janice bought, respectively
Since there are 30 items in all, $a+b+c = 30$
The total cost is 3000 cents, so $30a+200b+300c = 3000$, which can be rewritten as \begin{align*}
30a+(30b+170b)+(30c+270c) &= 3000\\
\Rightarrow 30(a+b+c) + 170b+270c &= 3000.
\end{align*}  Substituting $a+b+c = 30$ gives \begin{align*}
30\cdot30 + 170b+270c &=3000\\
\Rightarrow 170b+270c &= 2100\\
\Rightarrow 17b+27c &= 210.
\end{align*} Thus, $17b+27c$ is a multiple of 10
Since $17b+27c = 10(b+2c) + 7(b+c)$, $7(b+c)$ is also a multiple of 10
10 cannot divide 7, so 10 divides $b+c$
Janice bought 30 items, so the reasonable values of $b+c$ are $0, 10, 20, 30$
If $b+c = 0$, then $17b+27c = 0$, which isn't true
If $b+c=20$, then the least possible value of $17b+27c$ is $17\cdot20 = 340$, which is also impossible
By the same reasoning $b+c=30$ is also impossible
We conclude that $b+c= 10$, namely that $b=6$ and $c=4$ to satisfy $17b+27c = 210$
Thus $a = 30-(b+c) = \boxed{20}$.
The stated property of $f(x)$ can be written as an equation which holds for all $x$: $$f(x-20) = f(x).$$We are looking for the smallest positive $a$ such that the equation $$f\left(\frac{x-a}5\right) = f\left(\frac x5\right)$$holds for all $x$
Rewriting this equation as $$f\left(\frac x5-\frac a5\right) = f\left(\frac x5\right),$$we see that it is implied by the known property of $f(x)$ if $\frac a5$ is equal to $20$ (or a multiple of $20$), or in other words, if $a$ is equal to $100$ (or a multiple of $100$)
So, the smallest positive $a$ for which we know that this property holds is $a=\boxed{100}$.
Expanding $(x + 2)(3x^2 - x + 5)$ gives \begin{align*}
&x(3x^2)+x(-x)+x(5) +2(3x^2)+2(-x)+2(5) \\
&\qquad = Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D .\end{align*}Computing the products on the left side gives \[3x^3-x^2+5x+6x^2-2x+10 = Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D .\]Simplifying the left side gives \[3x^3+5x^2+3x+10 = Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D,\]so $A=3$, $B=5$, $C=3$, and $D=10$ and $$A+B+C+D=3+5+3+10=\boxed{21}.$$
Represent the three integers as $n-2$, $n$, and $n+2$, where $n$ is the middle integer
The problem states that  \[
n(n-2)(n+2)=7(n+(n+2)+(n-2)),
\] which simplifies to $(n-2)(n+2)=21$
Since $7\cdot3$ and $21\cdot1$ are the only representations of 21 as a product of two positive integers, we see that $n-2=3$ and $n+2=7$ which implies $n=\boxed{5}$.
We can factor the expression $x+1$ out of each term: \[3x(x+1) + 7(x+1) = \boxed{(3x+7)(x+1)}.\]
Note that $\frac{a}{25-a}+1=\frac{a}{25-a}+\frac{25-a}{25-a}=\frac{a+25-a}{25-a}=\frac{25}{25-a}$
The same trick can be used with the other two terms, so $\frac{b}{65-b}+1=\frac{65}{65-b}$, and $\frac{c}{60-c}+1=\frac{60}{60-c}$
Thus, we add 1 to each term on the left side of our equation: $$\frac{a}{25-a}+1+\frac{b}{65-b}+1+\frac{c}{60-c}+1=7+1+1+1.$$ Now we can use the substitution we derived earlier, so $$\frac{25}{25-a}+\frac{65}{65-b}+\frac{60}{60-c}=10.$$ Finally, we divide everything by $5$ to find that $$\frac{5}{25-a}+\frac{13}{65-b}+\frac{12}{60-c}=\boxed{2}.$$
Let $x$ represent the number of gallons the tank holds when it is full
We know that the difference between $\frac78$ full and $\frac12$ full is 12 gallons, so we set up an equation and solve for $x$
\begin{align*}
12&=\frac78x-\frac12x\quad\Rightarrow\\
12&=\frac38x\quad\Rightarrow\\
12\cdot\frac83&=x\quad\Rightarrow\\
\end{align*} The tank holds $\boxed{32}$ gallons when it is full.
First, we factor out the constants of the squared terms to get $9(x^2-2x)+9(y^2+4y)=-44$.
To complete the square, we need to add $\left(\dfrac{2}{2}\right)^2=1$ after the $-2x$ and $\left(\dfrac{4}{2}\right)^2=4$ after the $4y$, giving $9(x-1)^2+9(y+2)^2=-44+9+36=1$
Dividing the equation by $9$ gives $(x-1)^2+(y+2)^2=\dfrac{1}{9}$, so the center is $\boxed{(1,-2)}$.
We can find $x$ by taking four times the second equation plus the first: $$4(7x+y)+(9x-4y)=28x+9x=37x=4(11)+30=74\implies x=2.$$Substituting into the second equation, we can find $y:$ $$7x+y=11\implies y=11-7x=11-7(2)=-3.$$Thus our answer is $\boxed{(2,-3)}.$
First we begin by solving the system of equations \begin{align*}
3+a&=4-b, \\
4+b&=7+a.
\end{align*}Adding the two equations, we get $3+a+4+b=4-b+7+a$, which simplifies to $7+a+b=11+a-b$
Cancelling $a$ from both sides, we get $7+b=11-b$
Solving for $b$, we find that $b=2$
Plugging this into the first equation above, we obtain $3+a=4-2$
Hence $a=-1$ and $3-a=\boxed{4}$.

There are three intersections, at $(-2,-1),$ $(1,2),$ and $(4,5)$
The sum of their $x$-coordinates is $(-2)+1+4=\boxed{3}$.
We proceed as follows: \begin{align*}
3y^2 + 5y + 2 &= 4\\
3y^2 + 5y - 2 &= 0\\
(3y - 1)(y + 2) &= 0.
\end{align*}This gives us $y = \frac{1}{3}$ or $y = -2.$ Of these, $y = \boxed{-2}$ is the smaller value, and thus is our answer.
Translating words into math, we have the equations \begin{align*}
a+b+c&=60\\
a-7&=N\\
b+7&=N\\
7c&=N\\
\end{align*} We will express the value of each of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $N$ and then substitute these equations into the first given equation to solve for $N$
From the second given equation, we have $a=N+7$
From the third given equation, we have $b=N-7$
From the fourth given equation, we have $c=N/7$
Plugging these equations into the first given equation to eliminate $a$, $b$, and $c$, we have $(N+7)+(N-7)+(N/7)=60\Rightarrow N=\boxed{28}$.
Dropping $n$ Froods earns $1 + 2 +\ldots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ points
Eating $n$ Froods earns $10n$ points
So we seek the least $n$ such that $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} > 10n$
Solving, we see that $n > 19$
Thus, $n = \boxed{20}$ is our desired answer.
We square both sides to get rid of the square root sign
This gives us $2-3z = 81$
Solving for $z$ gives $z = \boxed{-\frac{79}{3}}$
We squared an equation, so we have to test our solution to make sure it isn't extraneous
We have \[\sqrt{2 - 3\left(-\frac{79}{3}\right)} =\sqrt{2+79} = 9,\]so our solution is valid.
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer
Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution
In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions.

There are three intersections
The leftmost intersection lies on the line of slope $2$ through the origin, which is $y=2x$
Solving $2x=1.8$ yields $x=0.9$.
The middle intersection lies on the line of slope $-1$ through $(2,1)$, which is $y=-x+3$
Solving $-x+3=1.8$ yields $x=1.2$.
The rightmost intersection lies on the line of slope $2$ through $(2,1)$, which is $y=2x-3$
Solving $2x-3=1.8$ yields $x=2.4$.
Thus, the sum of the three $x$-coordinates is $0.9+1.2+2.4=\boxed{4.5}$.
If $x$ is a real number, so is $x+2$
Thus $f(x+2)=\boxed{2}$.
Begin by turning $3/7$ and $1/4$ into fractions with denominators of 56 to get $$\frac{3}{7}=\frac{24}{56},$$$$\frac{1}{4}=\frac{14}{56}.$$We can see that $14<M<24$, so the average of the possible values is $\dfrac{15+23}{2}=\dfrac{38}{2}=\boxed{19}$.
$\emph{Solution 1: Find the equation of the line.}$
A point-slope equation of the line is $y-0= -2(x-5),$ so the standard form of the equation of the line is $2x+y=10.$ When $x=0,$ we have $y=10,$ so the $y$-intercept is $\boxed{(0,10)}.$
$\emph{Solution 2: Use the slope without finding the equation.}$
Because the slope of the line is $-2,$ the line goes down $2$ steps for each $1$ step right
However, the point we are given on the line, $(5,0),$ is already to the right of the $y$-axis, which is where the $y$-intercept is.Therefore, we instead think of the slope as going up $2$ steps for each $1$ step left
We must take $1$ step left $5$ times to get to the $y$-axis from point $(5,0),$ so to stay on this line, we must also take $2$ steps up $5$ times, for a total of $10$ steps
The point that is $10$ steps up and $5$ steps to the left of $(5,0)$ is $\boxed{(0,10)}.$
We can simplify the inequality to $z^2-40z+336\le 0$
We could solve for the roots using the quadratic formula, but there is an easier solution by factoring: $z^2-40z+336=(z-12)(z-28)$
Thus the parabola $z^2-40z+336$ changes sign at $z=12$ and $z=28$
The solution is either the interval $(-\infty,12]\cup[28,\infty)$ or $[12,28]$
We test values to find that the quadratic is non-positive over the interval $\boxed{[12,28]}$.
We have $\sqrt[3]{6^3 + 8^3} = \sqrt[3]{216 + 512} = \sqrt[3]{728}$
To find the integer closest to this, we note that $8^3 = 512$, $9^3= 729$, and $10^3 =1000$, so $\sqrt[3]{728}$ is very close to $\boxed{9}$.
Add the three equations together and divide by 2 to get $x+y+z = 21$
Hence, $x = 8, y = 7, z = 6$, and $\sqrt{xyz(x+y+z)} = \sqrt{21(8)(7)(6)} = \sqrt{2^4\cdot 3^2 \cdot 7^2} = \boxed{84}$.
The only two real numbers that satisfy the equation $x^2 = 16$ are $4$ and $-4$
So, the sum of all possible values of $x$ is $\boxed{0}$.
We factor the denominator in the left-hand side to get \[\frac{Bx - 11}{(x - 2)(x - 5)}= \frac{A}{x - 2} + \frac{3}{x - 5}.\] We then multiply both sides by $(x - 2)(x - 5)$, to get \[Bx - 11 = A(x - 5) + 3(x - 2).\] We can solve for $B$ substituting a suitable value of $x$
For example, setting $x = 5$, the equation becomes $5B - 11 = 9$, so $B = 4$
Then \[4x - 11 = A(x - 5) + 3(x - 2).\] Setting $x = 2$, this equation becomes $-3 = -3A$, so $A = 1$
Therefore, $A + B = 1 + 4 = \boxed{5}$.
The vertex of the parabola appears to be at the value $(-1,-2)$
Therefore, it is the graph of \[y=a(x+1)^2-2\] for some integer $a$
We also know that $(0,-1)$ is on the graph, so \[-1=a(0+1)^2-2=a-2.\] Therefore  \[a=\boxed{1}.\]
The expression inside the ceiling brackets evaluates to $$\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{9} = 3 - \frac{2}{9}$$Since this is an integer minus a non-negative number less than one, the ceiling of it equals the integer, $\boxed{3}$.
Since $x<2$, it follows that $|x-2|=2-x$
If $2-x=p$, then $x=2-p$
Thus $x-p=\boxed{2-2p}$.
Notice that if we add $x(x+y)$ and $y(x+y)$, we can factor out a term of $(x+y)$ to obtain $x(x+y) + y(x+y) = (x+y)(x+y)$
Thus, $(x+y)^2 = x(x+y) + y(x+y)$, so $(x+y)^2 = 27 + 54 = \boxed{81}$.
Knowing that $3$ is a root of $9$, we see that $x = 8,2$
Hence, the sum of the roots is $10$.
Alternatively, we can rearrange the equation so that we have $x^2 - 10x + 16 = 0$
Then, using the case of Vieta's formula for a quadratic, we again see that the sum of the roots is $\boxed{10}$.
If we add $1$ to both sides of the equation, the left hand side may be factored using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick
Thus, $$xy + x + y + 1 = (x+1)(y+1) = 77.$$ Since $x,y$ are positive integers, then $x+1, y+1$ must be a pair of factors of $77$, which are given by $\{x+1,y+1\} = \{1,77\},\{7,11\}$
Thus, $\{x,y\} = \{0,76\},\{6,10\}$, though only the latter satisfies the given conditions
Hence, $x+y = 6 + 10 = \boxed{16}$.
Setting the expressions for $g(x)$ equal to each other, we get $5x-4=f^{-1}(x)-3$, so $f^{-1}(x)=5x-1$
If we substitute $f(x)$ into this equation for $x$, we get  \[f^{-1}(f(x))=5f(x)-1.\]Since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f^{-1}$, we have $x = 5f(x) - 1$
Solving for $f(x)$, we find \[f(x) = \frac{x + 1}{5}.\]Thus, $a=\frac{1}{5}$ and $b=\frac{1}{5}$, so $5a+5b=\boxed{2}$.
We have \[0.\overline{4} = \frac{4}{10} + \frac{4}{100} + \frac{4}{1000} + \cdots.\]This infinite geometric series has first term $4/10=2/5$ and common ratio $1/10$, so we have \[0.\overline{4} = \frac{2/5}{1-1/10} = \boxed{\frac{4}{9}}.\]
We know that $a+bi+c+di+e+fi=2i$
Thus, the real parts add up to 0 and the imaginary parts add up to 2
We then have  \begin{align*}
a+c+e&=0\\
b+d+f&=2\\
\end{align*} We know that $b=3$, therefore $d+f=\boxed{-1}$
We begin by considering the equation $x + y = 4$
From this, we know that $y = 4-x$
We can then substitute this into the equation $3xy = 4$ to get $3x(4-x) = 12x - 3x^2 = 4$
This then becomes $3x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0$
Using the quadratic formula, we find  \begin{align*}
x &= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \quad \Rightarrow \\
x &= \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144-48}}{6} \quad \Rightarrow \\
x &= \frac{6 \pm 2\sqrt{6}}{3}.
\end{align*}Thus, $a + b + c + d = 6 + 2 + 6 + 3 = \boxed{17}$.
The radius of the circular path of the horse closer to the center is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the radius of the path of the horse farther from the center
Since circumference is directly proportional to radius, the length of shorter path is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the length of the longer path
Therefore, 3 times as many revolutions must be made to go the same distance, which is $32\times3=\boxed{96}$ revolutions.
The slope of line segment $QP$ is $1.$ Since the "rise" of $QP$ is $6$ units, the "run" of $QP$ should also be $6$ units
Therefore, $Q$ is $6$ units horizontally to the left of $P,$ and so has coordinates $(-5,0).$
The slope of line segment $RP$ is $2.$ Since the rise of $RP$ is $6$ units, then the run of $RP$ is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 6=3$ units
Therefore, $R$ is $3$ units horizontally to the left of $P,$ and so has coordinates $(-2,0).$
(We could have used the coordinates of $P$ and the slopes of the lines to find that the equations of the lines are $y=x+5$ and $y=2x+4$ and used them to find the coordinates of $Q$ and $R.$)
Therefore, $QR=-2-(-5)=3$ and $P$ is $6$ units above the $x$-axis
Thus, treating $QR$ as the base of $\triangle PQR,$ we find that its area is $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot 3\cdot 6=\boxed{9}.$$
Since $4^2=16$, $\log_7x$ must equal $2$
Writing the equation $\log_7x=2$ in exponential form gives $7^2=x$, so $x=\boxed{49}$.
Call the three integers $x-2$, $x$, and $x+2$
We know that $(x-2)x(x+2) = 20(x-2 + x + x+2)$, or $(x^2-4)x = 20(3x)$
Canceling an $x$ on either side gives $(x^2 - 4) = 60$, so $x^2 = 64$
Thus, $x = 8$, (since the numbers are positive), so the sum of the three integers is $3 \cdot 8 = \boxed{24}$.
Since we may write $12 = x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y) = 6(x-y)$, we see that $x-y = \boxed{2}$.
Let $a,b,c$ be 2nd, 3rd, and 5th terms respectively
Our sequence is therefore $2,a,b,34,c,\dots$
From the information given, we have \begin{align*}
a &= \frac13(2+b)\\
b &= \frac13(a+34)\\
34 &= \frac13(b+c).
\end{align*} Before we find $c$, we use the first two equations to solve for $b$
Substituting $a = \frac13(2+b)$, we obtain \begin{align*}
b &= \frac13(\frac13(2+b)+34)\\
\Rightarrow 3b &= \frac13(2+b)+34\\
\Rightarrow 9b &= 2+b+102\\
\Rightarrow 8b &= 104\\
\Rightarrow b &= 13.
\end{align*} Substituting $b = 13$ into $34 = \frac13(b+c)$, we obtain \begin{align*}
34 &= \frac13(13+c)\\
\Rightarrow 102 &= 13+c\\
\Rightarrow c &= \boxed{89}.
\end{align*}
The sum of an arithmetic sequence equals the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms
In this case, the average of the first and last term is $\frac{a_1+a_3}{2}=\frac{128}{2}=64$ and the number of terms is 3
We multiply to get $64\cdot3=\boxed{192}$.
First, evaluating $h(-1) = 4(-1)^3 + 1 = -3$
Then, evaluating $g(-3) = 2(-3)^2 - 3 = \boxed{15}$.
We start out with the equation $n(n + 1) = 2550$
Expanding, we find $n^2 + n - 2550 = 0$
This factors to $(n - 50)(n + 51) = 0$, so $n = 50\text{ or }-51.$ Since $n$ must be negative, we have $n = -51$, hence our two integers are $n = -51$ and $n + 1= -50$, which add up to $\boxed{-101}$.
We can rewrite this expression as $(50 + 4)\times (50 - 4)$
This is a difference of squares: $(50 + 4)(50 - 4) = 50^2 - 4^2 = 2500 - 16 = \boxed{2484}$.
We will complete the square to determine the standard form equation of the circle
Shifting all but the constant term from the RHS to the LHS, we have $x^2-8x+y^2+6y=-20$
Completing the square in $x$, we add $(-8/2)^2=16$ to both sides
Completing the square in $y$, we add $(6/2)^2=9$ to both sides
The equation becomes \begin{align*}
x^2-8x+y^2+6y&=-20\\
\Rightarrow x^2-8x+16+y^2+6y+9&=5\\
\Rightarrow (x-4)^2+(y+3)^2&=5
\end{align*} Thus, the center of the circle is at point $(4,-3)$ so $x+y=4+(-3)=\boxed{1}$.
We solve the equation $f(x) = -5$ on the domains $x < -2$ and $x \ge -2.$
If $x < -2,$ then $f(x) = 2x + 7,$ so we want to solve $2x + 7 = -5.$ The solution is $x = -6,$ which satisfies $x < -2.$
If $x \ge -2,$ then $f(x) = -x^2 - x + 1,$ so we want to solve $-x^2 - x + 1 = -5.$ This equation simplifies to $x^2 + x - 6 = 0,$ which factors as $(x - 2)(x + 3) = 0.$ The solutions are $x = 2$ and $x = -3,$ but only $x = 2$ satisfies $x \ge -2.$
Therefore, the solutions are $-6$ and $2,$ and their sum is $(-6) + 2 = \boxed{-4}.$
This is a finite geometric series with first term $\frac13$ and common ratio $\frac13$
There are five terms, so the sum of this series is $\frac{\frac13\left(1-\left(\frac13\right)^5\right)}{1-\frac13} = \boxed{\frac{121}{243}}$.
We begin by evaluating the RHS of the equation
Since $27=3^3$, we know that $27^{\frac13}=3$ and $\log_{27} 3=\frac13$
This allows us to simplify the original equation as $\log_x 4=\frac13$
Writing this equation in exponential form, we get $x^{\frac13}=4$, which gives us the solution $x=4^3=\boxed{64}$.
To find the two solutions, we use the quadratic formula
We can write our equation as $x^2-x-1=0$
Making the coefficients more visible, we have the equation $$(1)x^2 + (-1)x + (-1) = 0.$$The quadratic formula then gives $$x = \frac{-(-1)\pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \frac{1\pm\sqrt5}{2}.$$Letting $\Phi=\frac{1+\sqrt5}{2}$ and $\varphi = \frac{1-\sqrt5}{2}$, we have \begin{align*}
\Phi-\varphi &= \left(\frac{1+\sqrt5}{2}\right)-\left(\frac{1-\sqrt5}{2}\right) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt5}{2} - \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt5}{2}\right) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt5}{2} - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt5}{2} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt5}{2} + \frac{\sqrt5}{2} \\
&= \sqrt5.
\end{align*}The problem didn't tell us which solution was $\Phi$, but that doesn't matter: if $\Phi$ and $\varphi$ are swapped, then $\Phi-\varphi=-\sqrt5$, but either way, $(\Phi-\varphi)^2 = \boxed{5}$.
Since $y^3$ varies inversely with $\sqrt[3]{z}$, $y^3\cdot\sqrt[3]{z}=k$ for some constant $k$
If $y=2$ when $z=1$, then $k=2^3\cdot\sqrt[3]{1}=8\cdot1=8$
Thus, when $y=4,$ we have: \begin{align*} (4)^3\sqrt[3]{z}& =8
\\ 64\sqrt[3]{z}&=8
\\\Rightarrow\qquad \sqrt[3]{z}&=\frac18
\\\Rightarrow\qquad z&=\left(\frac18\right)^3
\\ z&=\boxed{\frac1{512}}
\end{align*}
We can have $\log_{10}10=1$ and $\log_{10}100=2$
Since $\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\log_{10}10<\log_{10}17<\log_{10}100$, meaning $1<\log_{10}17<2$
Thus, the desired sum is $1+2=\boxed{3}$.
We note that $999,999,999,998=10^{12}-2$, so $999,999,999,998^2=(10^{12}-2)^2=10^{24}-4\cdot10^{12}+4$
Consider this last expression one term at a time
The first term, $10^{24}$, creates a number with 24 zeros and a one at the front
The second term, $4\cdot10^{12}$, is a number with 12 zeros and a four at the front
The latter number is subtracted from the former one, so what is left is a string of 11 nines, then a six, then 12 zeros
Finally, the last term changes the last zero of the number to a four
Thus, we are left with $\boxed{11}$ zeros.
Let $2x$ be the smaller integer
Then the larger integer is $5x$
The product of the integers is 160, so $(2x)(5x)=160\implies 10x^2=160 \implies x^2=16$
Since $x$ is positive, this implies $x=4$ which in turn implies that the larger integer is $5\cdot4=\boxed{20}$.
We can split the expression $\left|\frac{12}{x}+3\right|=2$ into two separate cases
In the first case, we have \begin{align*} \frac{12}{x}+3&=2
\\\Rightarrow \qquad \frac{12}{x}&=-1
\\\Rightarrow \qquad -x&=12
\\\Rightarrow \qquad x&=-12
\end{align*}In the second case, \begin{align*} \frac{12}{x}+3&=-2
\\\Rightarrow \qquad \frac{12}{x}&=-5
\\\Rightarrow \qquad -5x&=12
\\\Rightarrow \qquad x&=-\frac{12}{5}
\end{align*}Since each case gave us one possible value of $x$, the product of all possible values of $x$ is equal to $\left(-\frac{12}{5}\right)(-12)=\boxed{\frac{144}{5}}$.
Let $j$ be John's age and $d$ be his dad's age
We are trying to find the value of $j$
We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information
They are
\begin{align*}
j &= d - 24 \\
j + d &= 68 \\
\end{align*}We want to find $j$, so we need to eliminate $d$ from the equations above
Rewriting the first equation we get $d = j+24$
Substituting this into the second equation to eliminate $d$, we have $j+(j+24)=68$, or $j=22$
Thus, John is $\boxed{22}$ years old.
The polynomial $f(x)+cg(x)$ will have degree 3 exactly when the $x^4$ terms cancel and the $x^3$ terms do not
The $x^4$ term of $f(x)+cg(x)$ is \[5x^4+c(9x^4)=(5+9c)x^4.\]This is zero when $c=-5/9$.
If $c=-5/9$, the $x^3$ term is   \[-4x^3+c(-6x^3)=(-4-6\cdot -5/9)x^3=-\frac{2}{3}x^3\neq0.\]Therefore there is only one solution $c=\boxed{-\frac{5}{9}}$.
By the definition of direct variation, we know that $x=my^3$ for some constant $m$
By the definition of inverse proportion, we know that $y=n/\sqrt{z}$ for some constant $n$
Substituting for $y$ in the first expression, we can see that $x=\frac{mn^3}{(\sqrt{z})^3}=\frac{k}{z\sqrt{z}}$ or $xz\sqrt{z}=k$ for some constant $k$
Substituting the given values, we can solve for $k$: $$xz\sqrt{z}=3\cdot 12\sqrt{12}=36\cdot 2\sqrt{3}=72\sqrt{3}=k$$Now, we can let $z=75$ and use the value of $k$ to solve for $x$: \begin{align*}
xz\sqrt{z}=x(75\sqrt{75})&=72\sqrt{3}\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x(75\cdot5\sqrt{3})&=72\sqrt{3}\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 375\sqrt{3}x&=72\sqrt{3}\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x&=72/375=\boxed{\frac{24}{125}}
\end{align*}
Let $a$ denote the number of questions Andy got wrong, $b$ the number of questions Beth missed, $c$ the number of questions Charlie answered incorrectly, and $d$ the number of questions Daniel got wrong
Using the information given in the problem, we can form the following system of linear equations:  \begin{align*}
a + b &= c + d \\
a + d &= b+c +4 \\
\end{align*} Adding the first two equations together yields $2a + b + d = 2c + b + d + 4$, which simplifies to $a = c + 2$
Since $c = 5$, Andy must have answered $\boxed{7}$ questions incorrectly.
When we multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we get $\frac{1+\sqrt{3}}{1-\sqrt{3}}$ = $\frac{(1+\sqrt{3})(1+\sqrt{3})}{(1-\sqrt{3})(1+\sqrt{3})}$
Simplifying, we obtain $\frac{1+2\sqrt{3}+3}{1-3}$ = $\frac{4+2\sqrt{3}}{-2} = -2-\sqrt{3}$
Thus $A=-2$, $B=-1$, $C=3$, and $ABC=\boxed{6}$.
Since $|x|$ is nonnegative, it is minimized when it equals 0, which occurs when $x=0$
So, the minimum point of the graph of $y=|x| - 3$ is $(0,-3)$
When we translate this to the left two units and three units down, we get the point $\boxed{(-2,-6)}$.
The arithmetic sequence 1, 3, 5, $\dots$, 17, has common difference 2, so the $n^{\text{th}}$ term is $1 + 2(n - 1) = 2n - 1$
If $2n - 1 = 17$, then $n = 9$, so this arithmetic sequence contains 9 terms.
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(1 + 17)/2 \cdot 9 = \boxed{81}$.
We have $3 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ yd}$
Cubing both sides, we get $27 \text{ ft}^3 = 1 \text{ yd}^3$
So there are $\boxed{27}$ cubic feet in one cubic yard.
Since the graph of $f$ contains the point $(-3,a)$, we know that  \[a=f(-3)=3(-3)+b=b-9.\]Since the graph of $f^{-1}$ also contains this point we know that $f^{-1}(-3)=a$ or $-3=f(a)$
Therefore \[-3=f(a)=3a+b.\]Substitution for $a$ gives \[-3=3(b-9)+b=4b-27.\]Therefore $b=\frac14(27-3)=6$
This forces \[a=b-9=6-9=\boxed{-3}.\]One could also recall that the graph of $f$ is a line and the graph of $f^{-1}$ is that line reflected through $y=x$
Since the slopes of these lines are not 1, the lines both intersect $y=x$ at a single point and that point is also the point of intersection of the graphs of $f$ and $f^{-1}$
Therefore the intersection point must be $(-3,-3)$, giving $a=\boxed{-3}$.
After dividing both sides by 2 and moving the constant over, we get a quadratic expression and solve for the roots: \begin{align*}
x^2+4x+3&\le0\quad \Rightarrow\\
(x+1)(x+3)&\le0.
\end{align*}The quadratic expression equals 0 at $x=-3$ and $x=-1$, meaning it changes sign at each root
Now we look at the sign of the quadratic when $x<-3$, when $-3<x<-1$, and when $x>-1$
When $x<-3$, $(x+3)$ and $(x+1)$ are both negative, so the product is positive
When $-3<x<-1$, $(x+3)$ becomes positive, while $(x+1)$ remains negative - the product is negative
When $x>-1$, both factors are positive, so the product is positive
So, $(x+1)(x+3)\le0$ when $-3\le x\le-1$, which means our answer in interval notation is $\boxed{[-3, -1]}$.
Alternatively, consider that the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, so the graph of $(x+1)(x+3)=0$ opens up
When there are two distinct roots, the shape of the parabola means that the product is negative when $x$ is between the roots and positive when $x$ is less than both roots or greater than both roots.
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2-6x+y^2+4y+18\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(6/2)^2=9$
Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$
Thus, we have \[(x^2-6x+9)-9+(y^2+4y+4)-4+18 \Rightarrow (x-3)^2+(y+2)^2+5\]Since the minimum value of $(x-3)^2$ and $(y+2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{5}$, and is achieved when $x=3$ and $y=-2$.
Since $r$ and $s$ vary inversely, $r\cdot s$ must be a constant
Thus $1200\cdot .35 = s \cdot 2400 \Rightarrow s = \frac{.35}2 = \boxed{.175}$.
Substituting in for $d$ in terms of $c$ in the second equation gives $b = 3 (2c - 1) = 6c - 3$.
Substituting in for $b$ in terms of $c$ in the third equation gives $a = 3 (6c - 3) + c = 19c - 9$.
Finally, substituting in for $a$, $b$, and $d$ in terms of $c$ in the first equation gives $2(19c-9)+3(6c-3)+5c+7(c-1) = 34$
Simplifying this gives $68c = 68$, so $c = 1$
Note that $c -1 = d$, so $d = 0$
Therefore, the product $a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \boxed{0}$.
There are two numbers whose square is 36; these numbers are 6 and $-6$, and their product is $\boxed{-36}$.
Completing the square, we can rewrite this equation as $(x+5)^2-25+(y+3)^2-9=k$, or $(x+5)^2+(y+3)^2=34+k$
Because this equation must represent a circle of radius 6, we need $34+k=6^2=36$, so $k=\boxed{2}$.
Cubing both sides of  \[
1\text{ yard}=3\text{ feet}
\] we find that 1 cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet
Therefore, 3 cubic yards are equal to $27\cdot3=\boxed{81}$ cubic feet.
Five yahs are equivalent to 3 rahs, so $5\cdot 200=1000$ yahs are equivalent to $3\cdot 200=600$ rahs
Eight rahs are equivalent to 5 bahs, so $8\cdot 75=600$ rahs are equivalent to $5\cdot75=\boxed{375}$ bahs.
We expand both sides to find
\begin{align*}
(w+13)(w+13)&=(3w+7)(2w+4)\\
w^2+26w+169&=3w(2w+4)+7(2w+4)\\
w^2+26w+169&=6w^2+12w+14w+28\\
w^2+26w+169&=6w^2+26w+28\\
w^2+169&=6w^2+28\\
141&=5w^2\\
\frac{141}{5}&=w^2.\\
\end{align*}
So, expressed as a decimal, our answer is $\frac{141}{5}=\boxed{28.2}$.
The common ratio is $(-24)/16 = \boxed{-\frac{3}{2}}$.
The 20th triangular number is $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{(20)(21)}{2} = \boxed{210}$.
If you solved this problem by finding the solutions to the equation, go back and read the section again
The sum of the roots is $-b/a$, where $b$ is the coefficient of the linear term and $a$ is the coefficient of the quadratic term
So, the desired sum is $-(84)/(-32)=\boxed{\frac{21}{8}}$.
Notice that $(x-a)(x-b)(x-c) = x^3 - (a+b+c)x^2 + (ab+ac+bc)x -abc = x^3-6x^2+5x+12$
Thus by finding the roots we will determine the set $\{a,b,c\}$
But the roots are $x = -1,3,4$, so we see that $a^3+b^3+c^3 = -1+27+64 = \boxed{90}$.
The first ten positive multiples of 13 are 13, $13 \cdot 2$, $\dots$, $13 \cdot 10$, so we want to find the sum $13 + 13 \cdot 2 + \dots + 13 \cdot 10 = 13 \cdot (1 + 2 + \dots + 10)$.
For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $13 \cdot (1 + 2 + \dots + 10) = 13 \cdot 10 \cdot 11/2 = \boxed{715}$.
If the number is $x$, we set up the equation $x^2+85=(x-17)^2$ and solve for $x$
\begin{align*}
x^2+85&=(x-17)^2\quad\Rightarrow\\
x^2+85&=x^2-34x+289\quad\Rightarrow\\
34x&=204\quad\Rightarrow\\
\end{align*} The number is $\boxed{6}$.
We apply the distributive property to get\begin{align*}
(13x+15)\cdot 2x &= 13x\cdot 2x+15\cdot 2x\\
&= \boxed{26x^2+30x}.
\end{align*}
We are given that $\frac{x+2}{2x+2} = \frac{4x+3}{7x+3}$
Cross multiplying, we find $(x+2)(7x+3) = (2x+2)(4x+3)$
Multiplying out each side by the distributive property yields $7x^{2}+3x+14x+6 = 8x^{2}+6x+8x+6$
Simplifying, we find $x^{2}=3x$, so $x = 0, 3$
Checking our two answers, we find that indeed $\frac{2}{2} = \frac{3}{3}$, and also that $\frac{5}{8} = \frac{15}{24}$
The product of our two solutions is $0 \cdot 3 = \boxed{0}$.
By the associative property, $12 \times 24 + 36 \times 12$ equals $12 \times 24 + 12 \times 36$
Factoring 12 out, we obtain  \begin{align*}
12 \times 24 + 12 \times 36 &= 12 \times (24+36)\\
&= 12 \times 60\\
&= \boxed{720}.
\end{align*}
First, we find $p(1,-1)$
Since it falls into the otherwise category, $p(1,-1) = 3 \cdot 1 - 1 = 2$.
Next, we find $p(-5,-2)$
Since both numbers are negative, it follows that $p(-5,-2) = -5 - 2(-2) = -1$.
Thus, $p(p(1,-1),p(-5,-2)) = p(2,-1)$
This again falls into the otherwise category, and we find that $p(2,-1) = 3 \cdot 2 - 1 = \boxed{5}$.
The discriminant of the given quadratic equation is $\left(b+\frac 1b\right)^2 - 4c$
For the quadratic to have one root, it follows that the discriminant must be equal to zero, so $b^2 + 2 - 4c + \frac 1{b^2} = 0$
We are also given that there should be exactly one positive value $b$ satisfying this equation
Multiplying through by $b^2$ (for we know that $b \neq 0$) yields that $b^4 + (2-4c)b^2 + 1 = 0$; this is a quadratic equation in $b^2$ that has discriminant $(2-4c)^2 - 4$
Again, this discriminant must be equal to zero, so $(2-4c)^2 = 4 \Longrightarrow 2-4c = \pm 2$
The non-zero value of $c$ satisfying this equation is $c = \boxed{1}$.
Let the first have side length $2s$ and the second $s$
Then the perimeter of the first is $38\cdot2s=76s$
Since this is the perimeter of the second as well, the second has $76s/s=\boxed{76}$ sides.
We have  \begin{align*}
\#(\#(\#50))&=\#(\#(.5(50)+1))=\#(\#(26))\\
&=\#(.5(26)+1)=\#(14)=(.5(14)+1)=\boxed{8}.
\end{align*}
We can find this answer by plugging 7 into the function: \begin{align*} f(7)& = \dfrac{5(7)+1}{7-1}
\\ & = \dfrac{35+1}{6}
\\ & = \dfrac{36}{6}
\\ & = \boxed{6}
\end{align*}
Subtract $\frac{5}{x}$ and $\frac{1}{12}$ from both sides of the equation to obtain \[
\frac{7}{60}=\frac{7}{x}.
\] By inspection, the solution of this equation is $x=\boxed{60}$.
Adding real parts and imaginary parts separately, we have $(4-(-4)+0-2)+(-3-1+1-0)i=\boxed{6-3i}$.
Every prime number greater than 5 has a ones digit of 1, 3, 7, or 9
For each of these digits, let's add 6, take the resulting ones digit, and repeat the process two more times
We get the following sequences of digits
\begin{align*}
1, 7, 3, 9 \\
3, 9, 5, 1 \\
7, 3, 9, 5 \\
9, 5, 1, 7
\end{align*} Only the first of these sequences could be the sequence of ones digits of four prime numbers, since each of the other three sequences contains 5
Therefore, the units digit of $a$ is $\boxed{1}$
The example $a=11$ shows that there exists such a sequence of consecutive prime numbers.
Let's start by rewriting this problem into equation form:
\begin{align*}
x + y &= 50, \\
x - y &= 6.
\end{align*}
We want to find $xy$, so let's find $x$ and $y$ separately.
Begin by adding the two equations:  \begin{align*}
2x &= 56 \\
x &= 28
\end{align*} Now, subtract the two equations \begin{align*}
2y &= 44 \\
y &= 22
\end{align*}
So then $x \cdot y = 22 \cdot 28 = \boxed{616}$
The greatest common factor of $145b^2$ and $29b$ is $29b$
We factor $29b$ out of both terms to get:\begin{align*}
145b^2 +29b &= 29b \cdot 5b+ 29b \cdot 1\\
&=\boxed{29b(5b+1)}.
\end{align*}
Let's perform the addition one step at a time
The first step is adding $c$ and $a$ in the right column
Since $c$ and $a$ can't both be 0 and $c+a$ is at most $9+8=17$, we know that $c+a=10$
The one carries over.
The second step is adding $b$ and $c$ in the middle column
Similarly, we know that $b+c+1=10$ (the one is from the carrying over), so $b+c=9$
The one carries over.
The third step is adding $a$ and $d$ in the left column
Similarly, we know that $a+d+1=10$ so $a+d=9$.
Thus, we have the three equations \begin{align*}
a+c&=10\\
b+c&=9\\
a+d&=9
\end{align*} Adding the last two equations gives $b+c+a+d = 9 + 9 =18$, so our answer is $\boxed{18}$
This corresponds to $(a,b,c,d)\Rightarrow (4,3,6,5)$.
$6075$ can be factored as $3^55^2$ - thus, since we are dividing by 3 repeatedly, there will be $\boxed{6}$ integer terms.
Let $x$ be the initial amount
After four years, at a ten percent annual interest rate, the investment will have grown to $x \cdot 1.1^4$, so $x \cdot 1.1^4 = 439.23$
Then $x = 439.23/1.1^4 = \boxed{300}$.
Factoring the quadratic gives $(x-1)(x-6)<0$, which means that $x-1$ and $x-6$ must have opposite signs, since the product of two factors with the same sign is positive
Now, we split into four cases
If $x<1$, then both factors are negative
If $x>6$, both factors are positive
If $x=1$ or $x=6$, one of the factors is zero
If $1<x<6$, $x-6$ is negative and $x-1$ is positive, meaning the inequality is satisfied
So our only possible range is $1<x<6$, giving interval notation of $\boxed{(1,6)}$.
The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$ is $\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)$, which should make sense since the midpoint is halfway between the endpoints
So the midpoint of the first segment is $\left(\frac{0+2}{2}, \frac{0+3}{2}\right) = (1,1.5)$ and the midpoint of the second segment is $\left(\frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{0+3}{2}\right) = (5.5,1.5)$
Note that the slope of the desired line must then be $\boxed{0}$, since the $y$-coordinates of the two points are the same.
Because the number of pebbles increases each day, the total number of pebbles is equal to $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 11 + 12 = (1+12) + (2 + 11) + \cdots + (6 + 7) = 6 \cdot 13 = \boxed{78}$.
If Sally makes $55\%$ of her 20 shots, she makes $0.55 \times 20 = 11$ shots
If Sally makes $56\%$ of her 25 shots, she makes $0.56 \times 25 = 14$ shots
So she makes $14-11=\boxed{3}$ of the last 5 shots.
We find the slope for each line
The slopes are $\frac31=3$, $\frac42=2$, $\frac93=3$, $\frac12$, and $\frac14$.
Parallel lines have the same slope, therefore lines $a$ and $c$ are parallel
Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals
None of the slopes above are negative reciprocals, therefore there are no perpendicular lines
There are $1+0=\boxed{1}$ pairs of lines that are parallel or perpendicular.
Letting $x= \!\sqrt{2 - \!\sqrt{2 - \!\sqrt{2 - \!\sqrt{2 - \cdots}}}}$, we have $x = \!\sqrt{2 - x}$
Squaring both sides gives $x^2 = 2 - x$, so $x^2 + x -2 = 0$
Factoring the left side gives $(x+2)(x-1) = 0$
Therefore, $x=-2$ or $x=1$
Clearly $x$ must be positive, so we have $x= \boxed{1}$.
We have \[(-27)^{5/3} = ((-3)^3)^{5/3} = (-3)^{3(5/3)} = (-3)^5 = \boxed{-243}.\]
If the number is $x$, we have $\frac{11}{100}x=77\qquad\Rightarrow x=77\cdot\frac{100}{11}=7\cdot100=700$
The number is $\boxed{700}$.
First, we move all terms to one side to get $4x^2 - 3x + 12 = 0.$ Seeing that factoring will not work, we apply the Quadratic Formula: \begin{align*}
x &= \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(4)(12)}}{2 (4)}\\
&= \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 192}}{8} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{-183}}{8} = \frac{3}{8} \pm \frac{\sqrt{183}}{8}i.
\end{align*}Now we see that $a = \dfrac{3}{8}$ and $b = \pm \frac{\sqrt{183}}{8},$ so $a + b^2 = \dfrac{3}{8} + \dfrac{183}{64} = \boxed{\dfrac{207}{64}}.$
We want to find the sum of the arithmetic series $301 + 303 + \dots + 499$.
The common difference is 2, so the $n^{\text{th}}$ term in this arithmetic sequence is $301 + 2(n - 1) = 2n + 299$
If $2n + 299 = 499$, then $n = 100$, so the number of terms in this sequence is 100.
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(301 + 499)/2 \cdot 100 = \boxed{40000}$.
$\underline{\text{Method 1}}$
The middle term of an arithmetic sequence containing an odd number of terms is always the average of the terms in the sequence
In this case, the average of the numbers is $\frac{320}{5} = 64$, which is also the third term
Counting back by twos, we find that the required number is $\boxed{60}$.
$\underline{\text{Method 2}}$
Represent the middle number by $n$
Then the five consecutive even numbers are $n-4, n-2, n, n+2$, and $n+4$
The sum of the five numbers is $5n$
Since $5n=320$, $n=64$
Thus, the first number, is $n - 4 = \boxed{60}$.
For the contents of the innermost square root to be nonnegative, we must have $x\geq 0$
To satisfy the middle square root, we must have  $$5-\sqrt{x}\geq 0$$ $$\Rightarrow 25\geq x.$$ Finally, the outermost square root requires $$3-\sqrt{5-\sqrt{x}}\geq 0$$ or $$9\geq 5-\sqrt{x}$$ $$\Rightarrow \sqrt{x}\geq -4,$$ which is always true
Combining our inequalities, we get $$0\leq x\leq 25,$$ or $x \in \boxed{[0, 25]}$ in interval notation.
If the line $x+y=b$ is the perpendicular bisector of the segment from $(1,3)$ to $(5,7)$, it must pass through the midpoint of this segment
The midpoint is: $$\left(\frac{1+5}{2},\frac{3+7}{2}\right)=(3,5)$$This point lies on the line $x+y=b$, so we must have $3+5=b\Rightarrow b=\boxed{8}$.
Let $d$ be the distance from Bill to the center of the Earth and $f$ be the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on him
Since $f$ is inversely proportional to $d^2$, $f\cdot d^2=k$ for some constant $k$
Since the force when Bill is on the surface of Earth is 600 Newtons, $k=600\cdot4000^2=9,\!600,\!000,000$
Therefore, if we let $x$ be the force that the Earth acts on  Bill with when he is on the Moon, $x\cdot240,\!000^2=960,\!000,\!000$ so $x=\boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}$.
Alternatively, the distance between Bill and the center of the Earth has been increased by a factor of 60, so the force has to be decreased by a factor of $60^2=3600$
Since $\frac{600}{3600}=\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$, we get the same answer.
The greatest common factor of $45x$ and 30 is 15
We factor 15 out of both terms to get\begin{align*}
45x+30 &= 15\cdot 3x + 15 \cdot 2\\
&= \boxed{15(3x+2)}.
\end{align*}
We have  $3\oplus 1 = 3\cdot 3 + 4\cdot 1 = \boxed{13}$.
We have that $x^2 - 16x + k = (x + b)^2 = x^2 + 2bx + b^2$ for some $b.$ Since $2bx = -16x,$ it stands to reason that $b = -8.$ Now, expanding $(x - 8)^2$ gives us $x^2 - 16x + 64,$ so $k = \boxed{64}.$
The largest power of $5$ that divides both terms is $5^3$
We factor out $5^3$ as follows: \begin{align*}
5^5 - 5^3 &= 5^3 \cdot 5^2 - 5^3 \cdot 1 \\
&= 5^3(5^2 - 1)
\end{align*} $5^2 - 1 = 24$, which factors as $2^3 \cdot 3$
Thus, the prime factorization is ${2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^3}$, and the sum of the prime factors is $2+3+5 = \boxed{10}$.
We first note that $\sqrt{3}\times 3^{\frac{1}{2}} = 3^{\frac{1}{2}}\times 3^{\frac{1}{2}} = 3^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}} = 3^1 = 3$ and $4^{3/2} = (2^2)^{\frac{3}{2}} = 2^{2\cdot \frac{3}{2}} = 2^3 = 8$, so \begin{align*}
\sqrt{3} \times 3^{\frac{1}{2}} + 12 \div 3 \times 2 - 4^{\frac{3}{2}} &= 3 + 12\div 3 \times 2 - 8\\
&=3 + 4\times 2 - 8\\
&=3+8-8 = \boxed{3}.
\end{align*}
Summing all three of the given equations yields $2a + 2b + 2c = (12 - 14 + 7) - 3a - 3b - 3c$, so $5a + 5b + 5c = 5$
It follows that $2a + 2b + 2c = \boxed{2}$.
The sides of the rectangle are parallel to the axes, so the fourth point must make a vertical line with (5,11) and a horizontal one with (16,-2); this means that the fourth point is (5,-2)
The graph of the region inside the equation is a circle with radius 3 and center (5,-2): [asy]
size(150);
defaultpen(linewidth(.8pt));
fill(Arc((5,-2),3,0,90)--(5,-2)--cycle,gray);
draw(Circle((5,-2),3));
draw((5,-2)--(16,-2)--(16,11)---(5,11)--cycle);
[/asy] Since each angle of a rectangle is $90^{\circ}$ and the corner coincides with the center of the circle, the rectangle covers exactly a quarter of the circle
The area of the intersection is thus $\frac14r^2\pi=\frac14\cdot3^2\pi=\boxed{\frac94\pi}$.
First we find that $f(g(x)) = A(Bx + A) + B = ABx + A^2 + B$ and $g(f(x)) = B(Ax + B) + A = ABx + B^2 + A$.
Now we plug back in
\begin{align*}
f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) &= B - A \\
(ABx + A^2 + B) - (ABx + B^2 + A) &= B - A \\
A^2 - B^2 + B - A &= B - A \\
A^2 - B^2 &= 0 \\
(A-B)(A+B) &= 0
\end{align*}
Since we are given that $A \neq B$, this means that $A + B = \boxed{0}.$
Since the following inequalities are true, \[\sqrt{1}<\sqrt{2}<\sqrt{4} \Rightarrow 1<\sqrt{2}<2\]\[\sqrt{16}<\sqrt{22}<\sqrt{25} \Rightarrow 4<\sqrt{22}<5\]\[\sqrt{196}<\sqrt{222}<\sqrt{225} \Rightarrow 14<\sqrt{222}<15\]the smallest integer greater than $\sqrt{2}$ is $2$, the smallest integer greater than $\sqrt{22}$ is $5$, and the smallest integer greater than $\sqrt{222}$ is $15$
Therefore, $2+5+15=\boxed{22}$.
We use the distance formula: \begin{align*}
\sqrt{(-15-0)^2 + (8-0)^2} &= \sqrt{225 + 64} \\
&= \sqrt{289} = \boxed{17}.
\end{align*} - OR -
Note that the origin, the point $(-15, 8)$, and the point $(-15, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length $8$ and $15.$ This is a Pythagorean triple, so the length of the hypotenuse is $\boxed{17}$.
If $3^{2x^{2}-5x+2} = 3^{2x^{2}+7x-4}$, then $2x^{2}-5x+2 = 2x^{2}+7x-4$
We can eliminate the $2x^2$ term from each side and solve $-5x+2=7x-4$ for $x$ to get $x=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
Multiplying both sides by $2x+37$ gives  \begin{align*}
6x^2 + 111x + 1 &= (2x+37)(3x+1)\\
&=2x(3x+1) + 37(3x+1)\\
&= 6x^2 + 2x + 111x + 37\\
&= 6x^2 +113x + 37
\end{align*}So, we have \[6x^2 + 111x + 1 = 6x^2+ 113x + 37.\]Subtracting $6x^2$ from both sides gives $111x+1 = 113x + 37$
Rearranging this equation gives $2x = -36$, from which we find $x = \boxed{-18}$.
Note that $a-2 = 0$, since $a = 2$
Thus the product in question is \[ (a -10) \dotsm (a-3) \cdot (a-2) \cdot (a-1) \cdot a = (a-10) \dotsm (a-3) \cdot 0 \cdot (a-1) \cdot a, \] which is $\boxed{0}$, since zero times any real number is zero.
We'll consider two cases.
Case 1: $5x-3$ is nonnegative
If $5x-3$ is nonnegative, then $|5x-3| = 5x-3$, so we have $5x - 3 \le 7$
Solving this gives $x \le 2$
The only integers for which $x\le 2$ and $5x-3$ is nonnegative are $1$ and $2$.
Case 2: $5x-3$ is negative
If $5x - 3$ is negative, then $|5x-3| = -(5x-3)$, so the inequality becomes $-(5x-3) \le 7$
Multiplying by $-1$ gives $5x-3 \ge -7$, so $5x \ge -4$, which means $x \ge -0.8$
The only integer greater than $-0.8$ for which $5x-3$ is negative is $0$.
Combining these cases gives us $\boxed{3}$ integers that satisfy the inequality.
Since $ar^7=8!$ and $ar^4= 7!,$ dividing the two terms allows us to solve for the common ratio $r:$ \[r^3= \frac{ar^7}{ar^4}=8.\]Thus, $r=2$ and the first term equals \[a=\frac{7!}{16}= \boxed{315}.\]
When using the distributive property for the first time, we add the product of $x+5$ and $x$ to the product of $x+5$ and 7: \begin{align*}
(x+5)(x+7) &= (x+5) \cdot x + (x+5) \cdot 7\\
&= x(x+5) + 7(x+5).
\end{align*}We use the distributive property again and combine like terms: \begin{align*}
x(x+5) + 7(x+5) &= x^2 + 5x + 7x+ 35\\
&= \boxed{x^2 + 12x + 35}.
\end{align*}
We begin by looking at each of the two possible cases; either $x<2$ and $f(x)=9x+16=-2$, or $x\ge2$ and $f(x)=2x-14=-2$
Tackling the first case, we find that if $9x+16=-2$, then $x=-\frac{18}{9}=-2$
Since this also satisfies the condition $x<2$, this is our first possible value of $x$
In the second case, we see that if $2x-14=-2$, then $x=\frac{12}{2}=6$
Since this also satisfies the condition $x\ge2$, this is our second possible value for $x$
The sum of these two values is just $-2+6=\boxed{4}$.
Let $x=\log_3\frac{1}{3}$
Then, we must have $3^x = \frac{1}{3} = 3^{-1}$, so $x=\boxed{-1}$.
We solve each inequality independently: $$
\begin{array}{r r r@{~}c@{~}l}
(1) && -3y &\ge & y+7 \\
& \Rightarrow & -4y &\ge & 7 \\
& \Rightarrow & y &\le & -\frac{7}{4}
\end{array}
$$ (Notice that when we divide by $-4,$ we must reverse the direction of the inequality
We must do the same thing whenever we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number.) $$
\begin{array}{r r r@{~}c@{~}l}
(2) && -2y &\le & 12 \\
& \Rightarrow & y &\ge & -6
\end{array}
\begin{array}{r r r@{~}c@{~}l}
(3) && -4y &\ge & 2y+17 \\
& \Rightarrow & -6y &\ge & 17 \\
& \Rightarrow & y &\le & -\frac{17}{6}
\end{array}
$$ Inequalities $(1)$ and $(3)$ set upper bounds on $y,$ with $(3)$ setting the stronger bound; the largest integer satisfying these bounds is $-3.$ Inequality $(2)$ sets a lower bound on $y;$ the smallest integer satisfying that bound is $-6.$ In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integers satisfying the three inequalities: $-6,$ $-5,$ $-4,$ and $-3.$
Let $(x,y)$ be one such point
Since $(x,y)$ is $5$ units from the line $y=13$, it must be 5 units above the line or 5 units below it
This means that the $y$-coordinate is 8 or 18
By the distance formula, since $(x,y)$ is 13 units from $(7,13)$, we have $$\sqrt{(x-7)^2+(y-13)^2}=13.$$Since $y$ is either 5 more or 5 less than 13, we know that $(y-13)^2=25$
So we substitute:
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{(x-7)^2+25}&=13\\
\Rightarrow\qquad (x-7)^2+25&=13^2\\
\Rightarrow\qquad (x-7)^2&=144\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x-7&=\pm 12.\\
\end{align*}So we have $x-7=12$ or $x-7=-12$, giving $x=19$ or $x=-5$.
Putting it all together, we have $y=8 \text{ or } 18$ and $x=-5\text{ or }19$, so our four possible points are $(-5,8),$ $(-5,18),$ $(19,8),$ and $(19,18).$  The sum of all of these coordinates is $\boxed{80}$.
We have $10^{-2} = \frac{1}{10^2}$ and $\frac{1}{10^{-3}} = 10^3$, so  \[\frac{10^{-2}5^0}{10^{-3}} = \frac{10^35^0}{10^2} = 10^{3-2}5^0 = (10)(1) = \boxed{10}.\]
In order for the graphs of $y=3$ and $y=4x^2 + x -1$ to intersect, we must have $3 = 4x^2 + x - 1$, so $4x^2 + x - 4 = 0$
By the quadratic formula, if $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, then $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a};$$the (positive) difference of these two roots is given by $\left|\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}\right|$
Since $A$ and $B$ lie on a horizontal line, it follows that this difference is the distance $AB$
Substituting the given values, we have that the answer is $\left|\frac{\sqrt{1^2-4(4)(-4)}}{4}\right| = \frac{\sqrt{65}}{4}$
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{61}$.
Since $9$ minutes is $1/5$ of $45$ minutes, we can find the fractional part of a wall that Heidi can paint in $9$ minutes by dividing the amount of wall that Heidi can paint in $45$ minutes by $5$
Since Heidi can paint a whole wall in $45$ minutes, it follows that she can paint $\boxed{\frac{1}{5}}$ of a wall in $9$ minutes.
Begin by noticing that $256=16^2$
We can then repeatedly apply a difference of squares factorization: \begin{align*}
x^8-256&=(x^4+16)(x^4-16)\\
&=(x^4+16)(x^2+4)(x^2-4)\\
&=\boxed{(x^4+16)(x^2+4)(x+2)(x-2)}\\
\end{align*}
The $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence whose first term is $a_1$ and whose common difference is $d$ is $a_n=a_1+d(n-1)$
Therefore, the $n$th term of $A$ is $30+10(n-1)$, and the $n$th term of $B$ is $30-10(n-1)$
Therefore, the positive difference between the $n$th term of $A$ and the $n$th term of $B$ is $30+10(n-1)-[30-10(n-1)]=20(n-1)$
Substituting $n=51$, we find that the positive difference between the 51st terms of $A$ and $B$ is $\boxed{1000}$.
If we let $g(x)$ denote the inverse to $f$ then we can evaluate $f$ at $g(x)$ to get  \[f(g(x))=4-5g(x).\]Since $g$ is the inverse to $f$, the left side is $x$ and  \[x=4-5g(x).\]Solving for $g(x)$, we find $g(x) = \boxed{\frac{4-x}{5}}$.
Note that $a \star b = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2$
Thus, $4 \star 6 = (4 + 6)^2 = 10^2 = \boxed{100}$.
In the quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$, the roots sum to $\frac{-b}{a}$ and multiply to $\frac{c}{a}$
Therefore, for $x^2-nx+m$, we know that the sum of the roots is $n$ and the product of the roots is $m$
The requirement that $n$ be an integer with $0<n<100$ along with the requirement that the roots are consecutive positive integers leaves us with 49 possible values of $n$: $(1+2), (2+3), (3+4),...,(48+49),(49+50)$
Of these values of $n$, the corresponding value of $m$ would be $(1\ast2), (2\ast3), (3\ast4),...,(48\ast49), (49\ast50)$
In order for $m$ to be divisible by 3, thus, one of the roots has to be divisible by three
The values of $n$ in $(2+3), (3+4), (5+6), ..
,(48+49)$ satisfy that requirement, but in $(1+2), (4+5), ..
,(49+50)$ they do not
This eliminates one third of the possibilities for $n$
Since $n=(49+50)$ is disqualified, we are left with $48-(48\div 3) = 48-16=\boxed{32}$ possible values of $n$.
Since $f$ is a linear function, its slope is constant
Therefore
\[\frac{f(6) - f(2)}{6-2} = \frac{f(12) - f(2)}{12 - 2},\]so \[\frac{12}{4} =\frac{f(12) - f(2)}{10},\]and $f(12) - f(2) = \boxed{30}$.
We first substitute for $c$ to get \begin{align*} \frac{a+2}{a+1} \cdot \frac{b-1}{b-2} \cdot \frac{c+8}{c+6}
&= \frac{a+2}{a+1} \cdot \frac{b-1}{b-2} \cdot \frac{(b-10)+8}{(b-10)+6} \\
&= \frac{a+2}{a+1} \cdot \frac{b-1}{b-2} \cdot \frac{b-2}{b-4}
\end{align*} Since the denominators are not zero, we can cancel the $(b-2)$s to get \[ \frac{a+2}{a+1} \cdot \frac{b-1}{b-4} .\] Now, by the substitution $b= a+2$, this becomes \[ \frac{a+2}{a+1} \cdot \frac{(a+2)-1}{(a+2)-4} = \frac{a+2}{a+1} \cdot \frac{a+1}{a-2}
\] We can cancel as before to get \[ \frac{a+2}{a-2}, \] which is equal to $\dfrac{4+2}{4-2} = \dfrac{6}{2} = \boxed{3}$, since $a=4$.
We could also solve for $b$ and $c$ before simplifying
Since $a= 4$, we have \[ b = a+2 = 4 + 2 = 6, \] and then \[ c = b - 10 = 6 - 10 = -4
\] The expression then becomes \begin{align*}
\frac{a+2}{a+1} \cdot \frac{b-1}{b-2} \cdot \frac{c+8}{c+6}
&= \frac{4+2}{4+1} \cdot \frac{6-1}{6-2} \cdot \frac{-4 + 8}{-4 + 6} \\
&= \frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdot \frac{4}{2} \\
&= \frac{6}{2} = \boxed{3}.
\end{align*}
We have $$
\frac{10^{2000} + 10^{2002}}{10^{2001} + 10^{2001}}=
\frac{{10^{2000}(1 + 100)}}{{10^{2000}(10 + 10)}} = \frac{101}{20}\approx \boxed{5}.
The equation can be rewritten as $\left\lceil\frac{3}{2}\right\rceil+\left\lceil\frac{9}{4}\right\rceil+\left\lceil\frac{81}{16}\right\rceil$
The smallest integer greater than $\frac{3}{2}$ is $2$
The smallest integer greater than $\frac{9}{4}$ is $3$
The smallest integer greater than $\frac{81}{16}$ is $6$
Therefore $2+3+6=\boxed{11}$.
The midpoint is $\left(\frac{7+(-3)}{2},\frac{-6+4}{2}\right)=\left(\frac{4}{2},\frac{-2}{2}\right)=\boxed{(2,-1)}$.
Let $b$ be the weight of one bowling ball and $c$ be the weight of one canoe
We have that $7b=4c$
Multiplying both sides by $\frac{3}{4}$, we have $\frac{3}{4} \cdot 7b=\frac{3}{4} \cdot 4c \Rightarrow \frac{21}{4}b=3c=84$
Solving this last equation for $b$, we have that one bowling ball weighs $\boxed{16}$ pounds.
We have $$\sqrt{\frac{3}{8}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{16}} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{6}}{4}}.$$
We use the fact that the sum and the product of the roots of a quadratic of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively.
Let $p$ and $q$ be the roots of $3x^2-5x-7$
Then the roots of $x^2+bx+c$ are $p+2$ and $q+2$, $c/1 = (p+2)(q+2)$
Since $c = c/1$, this means we are looking for $(p+2)(q+2)$
Since $3x^2-5x-7$ is also a quadratic, the sum $p+q$ is given by $-(-5)/3=5/3$ and the product $pq$ is given by $-7/3$
Thus, our answer is $(p+2)(q+2) = pq+2p+2q+4 = (pq)+2(p+q)+4 = (-7/3)+2(5/3)+4 = \boxed{5}$.
If we plug in 25 for $h$, we get \begin{align*} 25& =45-7t-6t^2
\\\Rightarrow\qquad 6t^2+7t-20& =0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (3t-4)(2t+5)& =0
\end{align*}The two possible values of $t$ are $\frac43$, and $-\frac52$
Since the time can only be a positive value, the answer must be $\boxed{\frac43}$.
The common ratio is $$\frac{15}{\frac{3}{4}} = 20$$Therefore, the $n$th term is $(20^{n-1}) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)$.
If one million (aka $10^6$) divides the $n$th term, then it must be divisible by $5^6$
This can only happen if $n-1$ is at least $6$, or $n \ge 7$.
The $7$th term is $$\left(20^6\right) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \left(4\right)^6\left(5\right)^6\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = (2)^{10}(5)^6(3),$$which is divisible by $(2)^6(5)^6=10^6$, so the answer is indeed $\boxed{7}$.
The area of the square is $(x-2)^2$, while the area of the rectangle is $(x-3)(x+4)$
Now we set the area of the rectangle equal to twice the area of the square and solve for $x$: \begin{align*}
2(x-2)^2&=(x-3)(x+4)\quad\Rightarrow\\
2(x^2-4x+4)&=(x^2+x-12)\quad\Rightarrow\\
x^2-9x+20&=0\quad\Rightarrow\\
(x-5)(x-4)&=0.
\end{align*}So we know that $x=5$ or $x=4$, and our answer is $5+4=\boxed{9}$.
Let $a=2013$
The expression is equal to $\frac{a^3-2a^2(a+1)+3a(a+1)^2-(a+1)^3+1}{a(a+1)}$
We notice a common factor of $a(a+1)$ in the second and third terms of the numerator, so we split the fraction apart: $$\frac{-2a^2(a+1)+3a(a+1)^2}{a(a+1)}+\frac{a^3-(a+1)^3+1}{a(a+1)}$$The first part of the expression is equal to $-2a+3(a+1)$, which simplifies to $a+3$.
The second part of the expression has a numerator that can be factored as a difference of cubes
We will concentrate on the numerator for now: \begin{align*}
a^3-(a+1)^3+1 &= (a-(a+1))(a^2+a(a+1)+(a+1)^2)+1 \\
&= (-1)(a^2+a^2+a+a^2+2a+1)+1 \\
&= (-1)(3a^2+3a+1)+1 \\
&= -3(a^2+a)-1+1 \\
&= -3a(a+1)
\end{align*}Alternatively, we can expand the numerator, and factor:
\begin{align*}
a^3 - (a + 1)^3 + 1 &= a^3 - (a + 1)(a + 1)(a + 1) + 1 \\
&= a^3 - (a^2 + 2a + 1)(a + 1) + 1 \\
&= a^3 - (a^3 + 3a^2 + 3a + 1) + 1 \\
&= a^3 - a^3 - 3a^2 - 3a - 1 + 1 \\
&= -3a^2 - 3a \\
&= -3(a^2 + a) \\
&= -3a(a + 1).
\end{align*}Taken with the denominator, the second half of the expression simply equals $\frac{-3a(a+1)}{a(a+1)}=-3$.
Putting it back with the first half of the expression, the final expression equals $(a+3)+(-3)=a=\boxed{2013}$.
Factoring our original equation: \[3x^2+10x-25=(3x-5)(x+5)=0\]Therefore, the two solutions are $3x-5=0$ and $x+5=0$
\begin{align*}
3x-5&=0\\
3x&=5\\
x&=\frac{5}{3}
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
x+5&=0\\
\end{align*}Therefore, either $d$ or $e$ could equal either $\frac{5}{3}$ or $-5$
However, $(d-e)^2=(e-d)^2$ as shown below
\begin{align*}
(d-e)^2&=\{(-1)(e-d)\}^2\\
&=(-1)^2(e-d)^2\\
&=(e-d)^2
\end{align*}Setting $\frac{5}{3}=d$ and $-5=e$: \begin{align*}
(d-e)^2&=\left(\frac{5}{3}-(-5)\right)^2\\
&=\left(\frac{5}{3}+5\right)^2\\
&=\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2\\
&=\boxed{\frac{400}{9}}
\end{align*}
Since $y=1$, we have $1 =\displaystyle\frac{1}{3x+1}$
Multiplying both sides by $3x+1$, we have $$3x+1=1$$ $$\Rightarrow \qquad 3x=0$$ $$\Rightarrow \qquad x=\boxed{0}$$
The square of the binomial $rx+s$ is  \[(rx+s)^2=r^2x^2+2rsx+s^2.\]If this is equal to $ax^2+15x+4$, then $s$ must be either 2 or -2
Since $(rx+s)^2=(-rx-s)^2$, we may choose either $s=2$ or $s=-2$, and the solution will be the same
We choose $s=2$.
The square of $rx+2$ is  \[(rx+2)^2=r^2x^2+4rx+4.\]If this is equal to $ax^2+15x+4$ then we must have $15=4r$ or $r=\frac{15}4$
This gives our square: \[\left(\frac{15}4x+2\right)^2=\frac{225}{16}x^2+15x+4.\]Therefore $a=\boxed{\frac{225}{16}}$.
Isolating $p(x),$ we have: \begin{align*}
p(x)&=(7x^3+24x^2+25x+1)-(x^5+3x^3+9x)\\
&=-x^5+(7-3)x^3+24x^2+(25-9)x+1\\
&=\boxed{-x^5+4x^3+24x^2+16x+1}.
\end{align*}
We rearrange the sum to make it easier to collect like terms: \begin{align*}
&(x^3+4x^2-7x+11)+(-4x^4-x^3+x^2+7x+3)\\
&\qquad=-4x^4+(1-1)x^3+(1+4)x^2+(-7+7)x+(11+3)\\
&\qquad=\boxed{-4x^4+5x^2+14}.
\end{align*}
First we must find $g(g(g(10.5)))$
We have $10.5>0$, so $g(10.5)=2(10.5)-41=-20$
Thus $g(g(g(10.5)))=g(g(-20))$
Since $-20\le 0$, $g(-20)=-(-20)=20$, so we have $g(g(-20))=g(20)$
Finally, since $20>0$, we have $g(20)=2(20)-41=-1$.
Now we must find $a$ so that $g(g(g(a)))=-1$
Let $g(g(a))=b$
Then we need to find $b$ so that $g(b)=-1$
Which definition of $g(x)$ should we use? If we use the definition when $x \le 0$, the output will always be non-negative, but $-1$ is negative, so we must assume $b>0$
Then $g(b)=2b-41=-1$, and $b=20$.
So now we have $g(g(a))=b=20$
Since we know $a$ is negative, we know we're going to use the $x\le 0$ definition of $g(x)$, so $g(a)=-a$, and $-a$ must be positive
We substitute for $g(a)$ to find $g(-a)=20$
Since $-a$ is positive, we use the $x>0$ definition for $g(x)$, to find that $g(-a)=2(-a)-41=20$, so $-2a=61$ and $\boxed{a=-30.5}$.
We start with $243 = 3^5$ cans
After recycling these cans, we will have made $243\cdot\frac13 = 3^4$ new cans
We can then recycle these new cans to make $3^4\cdot\frac13 = 3^3$ new cans
Continuing this process, we want to find the sum $3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0$
This is a finite geometric series with first term $81$, common ratio $1/3$, and five terms
Thus, the sum is $\frac{81\left(1-\left(\frac13\right)^5\right)}{1-\frac13} = \boxed{121}$.
The two factors of $5x^2+nx+48$ must be in the form $(5x+A)(x+B)$
$A$ and $B$ must be positive integers to form the largest value of $n$
Therefore, $AB=48$ and $5B+A=n$
To form the largest value of $n$, $B$ must equal $48$
Therefore, $A=1$
\[5B+A=5(48)+1=\boxed{241}\]
We have $3x^y + 4y^x = 3\cdot 2^3 + 4\cdot 3^2 = 3\cdot 8 + 4\cdot 9 = 24 + 36 = \boxed{60}$.
Since the expression $\lceil{\sqrt{x}}\rceil$ stands for the least integer that is greater than or equal to $x$, the largest possible value of $x$ that could satisfy the equation is $15^2$, or $225$
The greatest integer smaller than $15$ is $14$, so the largest integer (smaller than $225$) that would not satisfy $\lceil{\sqrt{x}}\rceil=15$ would be $14^2$, or $196$
Therefore, any integer that is in the range $196 < x \leq 225$ could be considered a possible integer value of $x$
Since there are 29 numbers in this range, our final solution is $\boxed{29}$.
The fraction is equal to zero if the numerator is equal to zero
Thus, $x-3=0$, so $x=\boxed{3}$
(Note that at this $x$ value, the denominator is not equal to zero.)
Fat eats cereal at a rate of $\frac{1}{20}$ pound a minute, and Mr
Thin eats cereal at a rate of $\frac{1}{30}$ pound a minute
Together, they eat cereal at a rate of $\frac1{20}+\frac1{30} = \frac{1}{12}$ pound a minute
At this rate, it will take them $\frac{3}{\frac{1}{12}} = \boxed{36}$ minutes to eat 3 pounds of cereal.
We form the product by multiplying each of the 3 terms in $a+b+c$ by each of the 4 terms in $d+e+f+g$
This gives us $3\cdot 4 = 12$ products of pairs of the variables, and no pair is repeated among these 12 products
Therefore, no two of these 12 terms can be combined, so there are $\boxed{12}$ terms in the expansion.
The common difference is $5 - 2 = 3$, so the $25^{\text{th}}$ term is $2 + 3 \cdot 24 = \boxed{74}$.
After three minutes, the number of bacteria $n$ has tripled $9$ times
This gives us the equation $n \cdot 3^9 = 275,\!562$, or $19,\!683n=275,\!562$, so $n = \boxed{14}$
The vertex of the parabola is $(0, a^2)$
The line passes through the vertex if and only if  $a^2 = 0 + a$
There are $\boxed{2}$ solutions to this equation, namely $a = 0$ and $a = 1$.
First, notice that all three integers have a common factor of 10
We can remove this factor from the cube root as shown: \begin{align*}
\sqrt[3]{10^3\cdot3^3+10^3\cdot4^3+10^3\cdot5^3}&=\sqrt[3]{10^3(3^3+4^3+5^3)}\\
&=10\sqrt[3]{3^3+4^3+5^3}.
\end{align*} Now, evaluate the expression under the cube root: $$10\sqrt[3]{3^3+4^3+5^3}=10\sqrt[3]{27+64+125}=10\sqrt[3]{216}.$$ Since $216=6^3$, this expression simplifies to: $$10\sqrt[3]{6^3}=\boxed{60}.$$
Let the cost of one pencil be $a$ and the cost of one pen be $b$
We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information
The equations are:
\begin{align*}
5a + b &= 2.5 \\
a + 2b &= 1.85 \\
\end{align*}
We are trying to find the value of $2a + b$
Notice that when we add the two equations, we get $6a+3b=4.35$
This is just three times what we are looking for, so dividing both sides of this last equation by three, we get that $2a+b=1.45$
Thus, the cost of two pencils and one pen is $\boxed{1.45}$ dollars.
Alternatively, we could solve our system of equations for $a$ and $b$ and then find the value of $2a+b$
In this case, we get that $a=.35$ and $b=.75$, so $2a+b=1.45$, as expected.
Since $f(b)=4$, the point $(b,4)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$
By inspection, $(2,4)$ is on the graph, so $b=2$ (there is no other candidate since $f$ is stated to be an invertible function).
Similarly, since $f(a)=2$, the point $(a,2)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$
By inspection, $(0,2)$ is on the graph, so $a=0$.
Therefore, $a-b=0-2=\boxed{-2}$.
We complete the square.
The square whose non-constant terms agree with $x^2+1300x+1300$ is $(x+650)^2$
Specifically, we have $$(x+650)^2 = x^2 + 1300x + 650^2,$$so \begin{align*}
x^2+1300x+1300 &= (x+650)^2 - 650^2 + 1300 \\
&= (x+650)^2 - 650\cdot 650 + 2\cdot 650 \\
&= (x+650)^2 + (-650+2)\cdot 650 \\
&= (x+650)^2 + (-648)(650).
\end{align*}This has the target form $(x+b)^2+c$, where $b=650$ and $c=(-648)(650)$
Therefore, $\frac{c}{b} = \frac{(-648)(650)}{650} = \boxed{-648}$.
The number of seconds that Jimmy takes to climb the first five flights are 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40.
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(20 + 40)/2 \cdot 5 = \boxed{150}$.
Simplifying the squares, we have \begin{align*}
&(2^{1004}+5^{1005})^2-(2^{1004}-5^{1005})^2\\
&\qquad=2^{2008}+2\cdot2^{1004}\cdot5^{1005}+5^{2010}\\
&\qquad\qquad-2^{2008}+2\cdot2^{1004}\cdot5^{1005}-5^{2010}\\
&\qquad=4\cdot2^{1004}\cdot5^{1005}
\end{align*}Since $4\cdot2^{1004}=2\cdot2^{1005}$, we can rewrite the expression as  \[2\cdot2^{1005}\cdot5^{1005}=2\cdot10^{1005}=20\cdot10^{1004}\]Thus, $k=\boxed{20}$.
To solve for the $x$-intercept, we let $y$ equal 0, and then solve for the value of $x$ as shown: \begin{align*}
0-4&=4(x-8)\\
\Rightarrow\qquad -1&=(x-8)\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 7&=x
\end{align*} Similarly, let $x$ equal 0, and solve for the $y$-intercept: \begin{align*}
y-4&=4(0-8)\\
\Rightarrow\qquad y-4&=-32\\
\Rightarrow\qquad y&=-28
\end{align*} Therefore, the sum of the $x$ and $y$ intercepts is $7+(-28)=\boxed{-21}$.
At the intersection of two lines, the $x$'s are equal and the $y$'s are equal
We may set $4x - 19 = 95 - 2x$ to find an $x$, where the $y$'s are equal.
\begin{align*}
4x - 19 &= 95 - 2x \\
6x &= 114 \\
x &= \boxed{19}.
\end{align*}
Note that if $0\le x<1$, then $\lfloor x\rfloor = 0$, so $f(x)=-x$
Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ includes the interval $(-1,0]$
This is in fact the whole domain; $f(x)$ can't be less than or equal to $-1$, because $x$ and $\lfloor x\rfloor$ necessarily differ by less than $1$, and $f(x)$ can't be positive, because $\lfloor x\rfloor$ is by definition less than or equal to $x$.
Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{(-1,0]}$.
Denote the original portions for Al, Betty, and Clare as $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively
Then \[
a + b + c = 1000\quad\text{and}\quad a-100 + 2(b+c) = 1500.
\] Substituting $b+c=1000-a$ in the second equation,   we have \[
a -100 + 2(1000-a)=1500.
\] This yields $a=\boxed{400}$, which is Al's original portion.
Note that although we know that $b+c = 600$, we have no way of determining either $b$ or $c$.
First we solve for $a$ and $b$
$$a=-\sqrt{\frac{16}{44}}=-\frac{\sqrt{16}}{\sqrt{44}}=-\frac{4}{2\sqrt{11}}=-\frac2{\sqrt{11}}$$$$b=\sqrt{\frac{(2+\sqrt{5})^2}{11}}=\frac{2+\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{11}}$$Now we solve for $(a+b)^3$
\begin{align*}(a+b)^3&=\left(-\frac2{\sqrt{11}}+\frac{2+\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{11}}\right)^3=\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{11}}\right)^3=\frac{\sqrt{5^3}}{\sqrt{11^3}}\\
&=\frac{5\sqrt{5}}{11\sqrt{11}}=\frac{5\sqrt{5}}{11\sqrt{11}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{11}}{\sqrt{11}}=\frac{5\sqrt{55}}{121}
\end{align*}So, $x+y+z=5+55+121=\boxed{181}$.
We complete the square: \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2}b^2 + 5b - 3 & = (\frac{1}{2}b^2 + 5b) - 3\\
&= \frac{1}{2}(b^2 + 10b + 25) - 3 -25 \cdot \frac{1}{2}\\
&= \frac{1}{2}(b + 5)^2 - \frac{31}{2}.
\end{align*} The minimum value of $\frac{1}{2}(b + 5)^2$ is $0$, since the square of a real number is never negative
Thus, the minimum value of the expression occurs at $b = \boxed{-5}$.
Putting the first equation in slope-intercept form gives $y = 3x + a$ which means this line has a slope of 3
Similarly the second equation gives $y = (a + 6)x - 1,$ meaning it has a slope of $a + 6$
Since the two lines are parallel they have equal slopes: $3 = a + 6 \Rightarrow a = \boxed{-3}$.
Substitute 1 for $x$ in the expression defining $f$ to find that $f(1)=3(1)^2-5=-2$
Substituting $-2$ for $x$, we find $f(f(1))=f(-2)=3(-2)^2-5=\boxed{7}$.
Factoring out $(x+1)$, we have:
\begin{align*}
&(x+1)((2x^2+3x+7)-(x^2+4x-63)+(3x-14)(x+5))\\
=\text{ }&(x+1)(2x^2+3x+7-x^2-4x+63+3x^2+x-70) \\
=\text{ }&(x+1)(2x^2-x^2+3x^2+3x-4x+x+7+63-70) \\
=\text{ }&(x+1)(4x^2+0x+0) \\
=\text{ }&4x^2(x+1) \\
=\text{ }&\boxed{4x^3+4x^2}.
\end{align*}
Repeatedly dividing by 2, we find the next terms in the sequence to be 125000, 62500, 31250, 15625,..
15625 is no longer a multiple of 2, so when we divide by 2 again, we will not get an integer, nor will it be a multiple of 2
Thus, no number in the sequence after 15625 can be an integer
Thus, our answer is $\boxed{15625}$.
Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$, where $x>y$
We wish to find $x$
The problem can be rewritten as the system of equations: \begin{align*}
x+y&= 22\\
x-y&= 4
\end{align*} Adding these gives: \begin{align*}
2x &= 26\\
x &=\boxed{13}.
\end{align*}
The graphs labelled (3), (4), and (5) are all invertible since no horizontal line intersects the graph in more than one place
In other words, for each real number $y$ there is at most one real number $x$ with $f(x)=y$
The first graph does not satisfy this condition
Thus the product of the labels corresponding to invertible functions is $3\times 4\times 5=\boxed{60}$.
The slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is $y = m x + b$ where $m$ is the slope
So if we get $y$ on the opposite side from $x$ and make it have a coefficient of 1, the slope of the line will be the coefficient of $x$
Thus we add $4y$ to both sides and divide everything by 4 which makes the coefficient of $x$ equal to $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
Notice that $(a+b) \cdot (a-b) = a^2 + ab - ab - b^2$, which simplifies to $a^2 - b^2$
Substitute $6$ for $a+b$ and $2$ for $a-b$ to find that $a^2 - b^2 = 6 \cdot 2 = \boxed{12}$.
The expansion of $(x+m)^2+8$ is $x^2+2mx+m^2+8$, which has a constant term of $m^2+8$
This constant term must be equal to the constant term of the original quadratic, so $m^2+8 = 44$, which yields the possibilities $m=6$ and $m=-6$.
If $m=6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2+12x+44$
If $m=-6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2-12x+44$
Of these two possibilities, only the first conforms to our information that $b$ was a positive number
So, the original quadratic was $x^2+12x+44$, giving $b=\boxed{12}$.
We have $$G(x) = \begin{cases}
-(x+1)+(x-1) &\text{if }x<-1 \\
(x+1)+(x-1) &\text{if }-1\le x<1 \\
(x+1)-(x-1) &\text{if }x\ge 1
\end{cases}.$$Simplifying, we have $$G(x) = \begin{cases}
-2 &\text{if }x<-1 \\
2x &\text{if }-1\le x<1 \\
2 &\text{if }x\ge 1
\end{cases}.$$Therefore, the range of $G(x)$ is $\boxed{[-2,2]}.$
Let the roots of this polynomial be $r_1$ and $r_2$
Since $\frac{c}{a}$ is the product and $-\frac{b}{a}$ is the sum of the roots of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we have $r_1r_2=16$ and $r_1+r_2=k$
Since $r_1$ and $r_2$ are integers, both must be factors of 16
The only possible combinations for $(r_1,r_2)$ are $(16,1),(8,2),(4,4)$, and the inverses of each ordered pair, which replicate values of $k$ already accounted for
Therefore, the only possible values of $k$ are 17,10, and 8, which average to $\boxed{\frac{35}{3}}$.
We get rid of the cube root sign by cubing both sides
This gives us $4-\frac{x^2}{3} = -8$
Solving this equation gives $x^2 = 36$, so $x=6$ or $x=-6$, so the positive difference between the two solutions is $\boxed{12}$.
Let Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages be $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively
We have the equations \begin{align*} \tag{1}
\frac{a+b+c}{3}=9 \Rightarrow a+b+c&=27 \\ \tag{2}
c-4&=a\\ \tag{3}
b+3&=\frac{2}{3}(a+3)
\end{align*} From Equation (3), we have $b=\frac{2}{3}(a+3)-3$
We substitute Equation (2) into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, to get $b=\frac{2}{3}(c-1)-3$
Substituting this last equation and Equation (2) into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$ and $b$, we have  \[[c-4]+[\frac{2}{3}(c-1)-3]+c=27\] Solving for $c$, we find that $c=13$
Thus, Chris's age is $\boxed{13}$.
We see that $-2$ is in the range of $f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c$ if and only if the equation $x^2+3x+c=-2$ has a real root
We can re-write this equation as $x^2 + 3x + (c + 2) = 0$
The discriminant of this quadratic is $3^2 - 4(c + 2) = 1 - 4c$
The quadratic has a real root if and only if the discriminant is nonnegative, so $1 - 4c \ge 0$
Then $c \le 1/4$, so the largest possible value of $c$ is $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
Using the formulas for arithmetic sequences, we see that the $20^{\text{th}}$ number for the north side is $3+6(20-1)=117$ and the $20^{\text{th}}$ number for the south side is $4+6(20-1)=118$
Also, we see that a north side house number is always 3 more than a multiple of 6, and a south side house number is always 4 more than a multiple of 6
We can then distribute the house numbers for the north and south sides into 3 groups each by the number of digits: \[\text{North side:}\qquad\{3, 9\},\qquad\{15, \ldots, 99\},\qquad\{105, 111, 117\}\] \[\text{South side:}\qquad\{4\},\qquad\{10, \ldots, 94\},\qquad\{100, \ldots, 118\}\] The north side has 2 houses with one digit house numbers, and 3 houses with three digit house numbers, so it must have $20-2-3=15$ houses with two digit house numbers.
The south side has 1 house with one digit house numbers, and 4 houses with three digits house numbers, so it must have $20-1-4=15$ houses with two digit address
Thus, the total cost is \[(1\times2+2\times15+3\times3)+(1\times1+2\times15+3\times4) = \boxed{84}\] dollars.
By definition, we see that $[-1.2] \leq -1.2$
The largest integer fitting the bill is $\boxed{-2}$.
We have $2r^2s^2 = (r^4 + 2r^2s^2 + s^4) - (r^4 + s^4) = (r^2 + s^2)^2 - (r^4 + s^4) = (1)^2 - \frac{7}{8} = \frac{1}{8}$, so $r^2s^2 = \frac{1}{16}$
This means that $rs = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
Simplifying the term $(c+2(3-c))$ gives $c+6-2c=6-c$
Distributing the negative sign over the first term gives $-(3-c)=c-3$
So our product is $$(c-3)(6-c)=6c-c^2-18+3c=-c^2+9c-18.$$ The sum of the coefficients is $(-1)+(9)+(-18)=\boxed{-10}$.
The common difference $d$ is $85-88 = -3$, so the $n^{\text{th}}$ term in the arithmetic sequence is $88 - 3(n - 1) = 91 - 3n$
If $91 - 3n = -17$, then $3n = (91 + 17) = 108$, so $n = 108/3 = 36$
Hence, $-17$ is the $36^{\text{th}}$ term in this arithmetic sequence, which means that $36 - 1 = \boxed{35}$ terms appear before $-17$ does.
Since 2, 3, and 7 are all primes, the denominator is in simplest radical form and we can't simplify it further
We attack this problem by getting rid of the square roots one step at a time
First we group the first two terms, and multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate: \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) + \sqrt{7}} & = \frac{1}{(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) + \sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) - \sqrt{7}}{(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) - \sqrt{7}} \\
& = \frac{(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) - \sqrt{7}}{(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})^2 - (\sqrt{7})^2} \\
& = \frac{(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) - \sqrt{7}}{2 + 2\sqrt{6} + 3 - 7} \\
& = \frac{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{7}}{-2 + 2\sqrt{6}}
\end{align*}Now this is in a form we know how to deal with, and we can just multiply by the conjugate as usual: \begin{align*}
\frac{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{7}}{-2 + 2\sqrt{6}} & = \frac{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{7}}{-2 + 2\sqrt{6}} \cdot \frac{-2 - 2\sqrt{6}}{-2 - 2\sqrt{6}} \\
& = \frac{-2\sqrt{2} - 2\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{12} - 2\sqrt{18} + 2\sqrt{42}}{-20} \\
& = \frac{4\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{42}}{10}.
\end{align*}This gives $A + B + C + D + E + F = 4 + 3 - 1 - 1 + 42 + 10 = \boxed{57}$.
We can apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to each of the equations
Indeed, re-arranging,  \begin{align*}
xy + 2x + 3y &= 6,\\
yz + 4y + 2z &= 6 ,\\
xz + 4x + 3z &= 30 ,
\end{align*}Adding $6$, $8$, and $12$ to both sides of each equation, respectively, yields  \begin{align*}
xy + 2x + 3y + 6 = (x+3)(y+2) &= 12,\\
yz + 4y + 2z + 8 = (y+2)(z+4) &= 14,\\
xz + 4x + 3z + 12 = (x+3)(z+4) &= 42 ,
\end{align*}At this point, we can substitute and solve by elimination
Even simpler, notice that if we take the product of all three equations, we obtain $$[(x+3)(y+2)(z+4)]^2 = 12 \cdot 14 \cdot 42 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7^2,$$so $$(x+3)(y+2)(z+4) = \pm 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7.$$We can now substitute that $(y+2)(z+4) = 14$ to find that $$(x+3)(y+2)(z+4) = 14(x+3) = \pm 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7.$$Hence, $x+3 = \pm 6,$ so $x$ is $3$ or $-9.$ The positive root is thus $x = \boxed{3}$.
We can begin by multiplying the second equation by two, giving us the following system of equations \begin{align*} 4u-5v&=23
\\ 4u+8v&=-16
\end{align*}From here we simply subtract the second equation from the first
This gives us $(4u-5v)-(4u+8v)=23-(-16)$, which simplifies to $-13v=39$ or $v=-3$
We now know the value of $v$, so we can just plug this into the first equation in order to solve for $u$
This gives us $4u-5(-3)=23$, or $4u=8$ and $u=2$
Since $v=-3$ and $u=2$, $u+v=2+(-3)=\boxed{-1}$.
Let the number of girls at HMS be $g$ and the number of boys be $b$
Thus, the total number of students implies $g + b = 1200$ and the attendance figures imply $\frac{2}{3} g + \frac{1}{2} b = 730$
Multiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting that from the second equation multiplied by 6, we get $g = 780$
And, the number of girls who attended the picnic is $\frac{2}{3} \cdot 780 = \boxed{520}$.
For the first six months, the (simple) interest rate is $12/2 = 6$ percent
Therefore, the investment grows to $10000 \cdot 1.06 = 10600$.
Let the annual interest rate of the second certificate be $r$ percent
Then the interest rate for six months is $r/2$, so the investment grows to $10600 \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{r/2}{100} \right)$
Therefore, \[10600 \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{r/2}{100} \right) = 11130.\] Then \[1 + \frac{r/2}{100} = \frac{11130}{10600} = 1.05,\] so $r/200 = 0.05$, which means $r = \boxed{10}$.
Here we take advantage of the relationship between the sum and product of the roots of a polynomial and the coefficients of the polynomial.
If $\alpha,\beta$ are the roots of the equation, then $k = \alpha + \beta$ and $\alpha\beta = -12$
Knowing that $\alpha\beta = -12$ and $\alpha,\beta$ are integers, we can make a list of possible values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$
\begin{align*}
(1,-12), (-1,12) \\
(2,-6),(-2,6) \\
(3,-4),(4,-3)
\end{align*} The possible values for $k$ are $1 - 12 = -11$, $12 - 1 = 11$, $2 -6 = -4$, $6 - 2 = 4$, $3 - 4 = -1$, $ 4 - 3 = 1$.
Adding up the positive values of $k$, we get $11 + 4 + 1 = \boxed{16}$.
If the graphs intersect at $(a,b)$, then we have $$h(a) = h(a-3) \qquad(= b).$$Thus, $(a,b)$ and $(a-3,b)$ are both on the original graph of $y=h(x)$
Looking for two points on the original graph which are separated by $3$ units horizontally, we find $(-2,3)$ and $(1,3)$
Thus $a-3=-2,$ $a=1,$ and $b=3;$ the graphs of $y=h(x)$ and $y=h(x-3)$ intersect at $(1,3),$ the sum of whose coordinates is $\boxed{4}$.
We factor the denominator in the left-hand side to get \[\frac{5x+2}{(x-10)(x+3)}= \frac{A}{x - 10} + \frac{B}{x + 3}.\]We then multiply both sides by $(x - 10)(x + 3)$, to get \[5x + 2 = A(x + 3) + B(x - 10).\]We can solve for $A$ and $B$ by substituting suitable values of $x$
For example, setting $x = 10$, the equation becomes $52 = 13A$, so $A = 4$
Setting $x = -3$, the equation becomes $-13 = -13B$, so $B = 1$
Therefore, $(A,B) = \boxed{(4,1)}$.
Dividing both sides by 3, we quickly note that $ 9 = 9^{x-1} \rightarrow 1 = x-1 \rightarrow x = \boxed{2}$.
Applying the difference of squares factorization, we see that any such point satisfies $(x+y)(x-y)=47$
Both factors are integers
The only pairs of factors of $47$ are $(47,1)$ and $(-47,-1)$
Thus we have that the coordinates satisfy one of the following four systems: (i) $x+y=47$, $x-y=1$; (ii)  $x+y=-47$, $x-y=-1$; (iii) $x+y=1$, $x-y=47$; (iv) $x+y=-1$, $x-y=-47$
Solving each of these $4$ systems individually gives exactly one solution in each integers for each system
Thus there are $\boxed{4}$ lattice points on the graph.
First we have \[
(1 \star 2) = \frac{1 + 2}{1 - 2} = -3.
\]Then \[
((1 \star 2) \star 3) = (-3 \star 3) = \frac{-3 + 3}{-3 - 3} = \frac{0}{-6} = \boxed{0}.
The common denominator desired is $\sqrt{5}\cdot\sqrt{7} = \sqrt{35}$
So, this expression becomes \[\frac{\sqrt{5}\cdot(\sqrt{5}\cdot\sqrt{7})+1\cdot\sqrt{7}+\sqrt{7}\cdot(\sqrt{5}\cdot\sqrt{7})+1\cdot\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{35}}.\]Simplifying this gives \[\frac{5\sqrt{7}+\sqrt{7}+7\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{35}} = \frac{6\sqrt{7}+8\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{35}}.\]To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{35}$ to get \[\frac{6\sqrt{7}\sqrt{35}+8\sqrt{5}\sqrt{35}}{35}.\]Simplifying yields ${\frac{42\sqrt{5}+40\sqrt{7}}{35}}$, so the desired sum is $42+40+35=\boxed{117}$.
Let $x = \log_\frac{1}{3}9$
Then, we must have $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^x = 9$, so $x=\boxed{-2}$.
Since the amount Kimberly owes is multiplied by 1.05 each month, we want the least integer $t$ for which $1.05^t>2$
Trying some integer values of $t$, we find that $\boxed{15}$ is the smallest that satisfies this condition.
Let the sum be $S$
This series looks almost geometric, but not quite
We can turn it into a geometric series as follows: \begin{align*}
S &= \frac{1}{2^1} +\frac{2}{2^2} + \frac{3}{2^3} + \frac{4}{2^4} + \cdots \\
\frac{1}{2}S &= \hspace{0.9 cm} \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{2}{2^3} + \frac{3}{2^4} + \cdots
\end{align*}We subtract the second from the first to obtain $$\frac{1}{2}S = \frac{1}{2^1} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{2^3} + \frac{1}{2^4} + \cdots$$Now, we do have a geometric series, so we can find $\frac{1}{2}S = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 1$, and $S = \boxed{2}$.
Letting $x= \!\sqrt{12 +\!\sqrt{12 + \!\sqrt{12 + \!\sqrt{12 + \cdots}}}}$, we have $x = \!\sqrt{12 + x}$
Squaring both sides gives $x^2 = 12+x$, so $x^2 -x-12 = 0$
Factoring the left side gives $(x-4)(x+3) = 0$
Therefore, $x=4$ or $x=-3$
Clearly $x$ must be positive, so we have $x= \boxed{4}$.
The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$
The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \boxed{408.04}$ dollars.
Each increase multiples the bill by $1+1\%=1.01$
Therefore, her final bill is $\$400(1.01)^2=\$408.04$.
The $x+5$ and $(x-3)^2$ in the denominators suggest that these might be factors of $x^3-x^2-21x+45$
Indeed, we find that this polynomial equals $(x+5)(x-3)^2$
Clearing denominators, we find that
\[1=A(x-3)^2+ B(x + 5)(x - 3) + C(x + 5).\]Thus, when we substitute $x=-5$, we find that $(-5-3)^2A=64A=1$, so $A = \boxed{\frac{1}{64}}$.
We multiply out using the distributive property:
\begin{align*}
&\phantom{==}(3x+2y+1)(x+4y+5)\\
&=3x(x+4y+5)+2y(x+4y+5)+1(x+4y+5)\\
&=3x^2+12xy+15x+2xy+8y^2+10y+x+4y+5\\
&=3x^2+14xy+16x+8y^2+14y+5.
\end{align*}Those terms which contain some power of $y$ are $14xy$, $8y^2$, and $14y$, and the sum of the coefficients is $14+8+14=\boxed{36}$.
We may find Cedric's balance by simply finding $\$12,\!000(1 + 0.05)^{15} \approx \$24,\!947.14.$
We may find Daniel balance by finding $\$12,\!000(1 + 15 \cdot 0.07) \approx \$24,\!600.$
Therefore, the difference between their balances is roughly $\$24,\!947.14 - \$24,\!600 \approx \boxed{\$347}.$
Notice that $(x-a)(x-b)(x-c) = x^3 - (a+b+c)x^2 + (ab+ac+bc)x -abc = x^3-x^2-4x+4$
Thus by finding the roots of this polynomial, we will determine the set $\{a,b,c\}$
But these are seen by factoring to be $x = 1,2,-2$, so we see that $a^3+b^3+c^3 = 1+8-8 = \boxed{1}$.
Let $t$ be the number of days that has passed
Darren's balance, in clams, is $100(1 + 0.10t) = 100 + 10t,$ whereas Fergie's balance, in clams, is $150(1 + 0.05t) = 150 + 7.5t$
Setting them equal to each other, we have $100 + 10t = 150 + 7.5t.$ Collecting like terms, we have $2.5t = 50,$ so $t = \boxed{20\text{ days}}.$
First, we combine like terms in the expression: \begin{align*}
(9x^5&+25x^3-4)-(x^5-3x^3-4)\\
&=9x^5+25x^3-4-x^5+3x^3+4\\
&=8x^5+28x^3.
\end{align*} We can factor out a $4x^3$ from the expression, to get \[8x^5+28x^3=\boxed{4x^3(2x^2+7)}.\]
The leading coefficient is the coefficient of the term with the highest power of $x$, which in this case is $x^4$
The coefficient of $x^4$ in $-3(x^4 - x^3 + x) + 7(x^4 + 2) - 4(2x^4 + 2x^2 + 1)$ is $-3 + 7 - 4 \cdot 2 = \boxed{-4}$.
Since I earned two dollars more than Andrew, we know that $$(t+1) (3t-3) = (3t-5)(t+2) + 2 \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad 3t^2-3 = 3t^2 + t -8 .$$Simplifying gives $t = \boxed{5}$.
We are asked to calculate $9+18+27+\cdots+63$
Factor out 9 and use the identity $1+2+3+\cdots+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ to find that $9+18+\cdots+63=9(1+2+\dots+7)= 9 \cdot \frac{7 \cdot 8}{2} = \boxed{252}$.
The number of toothpicks in each stage form an arithmetic sequence
The first term in this arithmetic sequence is 4, and the common difference is 3 (the number of toothpicks added to get to the next stage), so the number of toothpicks used in the 250th stage is $4 + 3 \cdot 249 = \boxed{751}$.
The square of a binomial $(a+b)^2$ is $a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$
In this problem we see that we are subtracting off the two square terms from the expansion of $(37 + 12)^2$, so we are left with $2 \cdot 37 \cdot 12 = \boxed{888}$.
Since the difference of the first two terms is $-2y$, the third and fourth terms of the sequence must be $x-3y$ and $x-5y$
Thus \[
x-3y = xy \quad\text{and}\quad x-5y = \frac{x}{y},
\]so $xy - 5y^{2} = x.$ Combining these equations we obtain \[
(x - 3y) - 5y^{2}= x\quad\text{and, therefore, }\quad -3y - 5y^{2} = 0.
\]Since $y$ cannot be 0, we have $y = -\frac{3}{5}$, and it follows that $x = -\frac{9}{8}$
The fifth term in the sequence is $x - 7y
= \boxed{\frac{123}{40}}$.
Since they are perpendicular, their slopes must multiply to -1
The first line has slope $-\frac12$ and the second $-\frac{a}{2}$, so $\frac{a}{4}=-1$ and $a=\boxed{-4}$.
Let the popularity of a toaster (or the number of customers who buy the appliance) equal $p$, and let the cost of the toaster equal $c$
According to Daniel's theory, $p$ and $c$ are inversely proportional
Thus, $(p)(c)=k$ for some constant value $k$
If $p=12$ when $c=500$, then $k=(12)(500)=6000$
So when $c=750$, \begin{align*} (p)(c)&=k
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (p)(750)&=6000
\\\Rightarrow\qquad p&=\frac{6000}{750}
\\ &=\boxed{8}.
\end{align*}According to Daniel's theory, 8 customers would buy the $\$750$ toaster.
We multiply both the top and bottom by the conjugate of the denominator: $$\frac{5}{2+\sqrt{6}} \cdot \frac{2-\sqrt{6}}{2-\sqrt{6}}=\frac{10-5\sqrt{6}}{4-6}=\frac{5\sqrt{6}-10}{2}$$Therefore, $A+B+C+D=5+6-10+2=\boxed{3}$.
Since the expression $\lfloor{\sqrt{x}}\rfloor$ stands for the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $x$, the smallest possible value of $x$ that could satisfy the equation is $6^2$, or $36$
The next integer greater than $6$ is $7$, so the smallest integer (greater than $36$) that would not satisfy $\lfloor{\sqrt{x}}\rfloor=6$ must be $7^2$, or $49$
Therefore, any integer that is in the range $36\le{x}<49$ could be considered a possible integer value of $x$
Since there are 13 numbers in this range, our final solution is $\boxed{13}$.
If $a$ is inversely proportional to $b$, then the product $ab$ is a constant
For $a_1$ and $a_2$ this implies: $$a_1\cdot b_1=a_2\cdot b_2$$We can divide both sides of this equation by $b_1\cdot a_2$ to find: \begin{align*}
\frac{a_1\cdot b_1}{b_1\cdot a_2}&=\frac{a_2\cdot b_2}{b_1\cdot a_2}\\
\Rightarrow\qquad \frac{2}{3}=\frac{a_1}{a_2}&=\frac{b_2}{b_1}\\
\Rightarrow\qquad \boxed{\frac{3}{2}}&=\frac{b_1}{b_2}
\end{align*}
We have $3 \text{ Y } 2 = 3^2-2(2)(3)+2^2 = 9+4-12 = \boxed{1}$.
Alternatively, you could notice that $a^2-2ab+b^2=(a-b)^2$, so the answer is simply $(3-2)^2 = 1^2 = \boxed{1}$.
Expanding the product on the left gives $0.03n + 0.08\cdot 20 + 0.08n = 12.6$
Simplifying the left side gives $0.11n + 1.6 = 12.6$
Subtracting 1.6 from both sides gives $0.11n = 11$, and dividing by 0.11 gives $n = \boxed{100}$.
The equation $f^{-1}(x)=0$ is equivalent to $x=f(0)$
If we substitute this into the original definition of $f$ we get  \[x=f(0)=\frac1{a\cdot0+b}=\boxed{\frac1b}.\]
A $y$-intercept is a point on the graph that lies on the $y$-axis, so $x = 0$
Hence, the number of $y$-intercepts corresponds to the number of real solutions of the quadratic equation $2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$
The discriminant of this quadratic equation is $(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 7 = -47$, which is negative, so the quadratic has no real roots
Therefore, the number of $y$-intercepts is $\boxed{0}$.

If $10$ of $15$ students received an $A$, then the ratio of students receiving an $A$ to students not receiving an $A$ is $\frac{10}{15}$, or $\frac{2}{3}$
Let $x$ be the number of students in Mrs
Berkeley's class who received an $A$
Since the ratio is consistent across the two classes, $\frac{2}{3} = \frac{x}{24}$
Cross-multiplying yields $x = \frac{24\cdot 2}{3}$, so, by simplification, we can see that $\boxed{16}$ of Mrs
Berkeley's students must have received an $A$.
We have that $A + B + C + D = 64$
Substituting everything in terms of $C$, we find that $(3C - 3) + (3C + 3) + C + (9C) = 64$, which means that $C = 4$
Thus $A = 9$, $B = 15$, and $D = 36$
Therefore our desired answer is $9\cdot 15\cdot 4\cdot 36 = \boxed{19440}$.
First substitute $y=\frac{4x-16}{3x-4}$ to find  \[
y^2+y=12,
\] which gives $y=3,-4$
Setting $\frac{4x-16}{3x-4}$ equal to 3, we find $4x-16=9x-12$ which implies $x=-4/5$
Setting $\frac{4x-16}{3x-4}$ equal to $-4$, we find $4x-16=16-12x$ which implies $x=\boxed{2}$.
Squaring both sides of the equation yields $\frac 2x + 2 = \frac 94$
Subtracting $2$ from both sides gives $\frac 2x = \frac 14$, so $x = \boxed{8}$.
We have $f(2) = 2^2 + 2\sqrt{2} = 4 + 2\sqrt{2}$ so $2f(2) = 8 + 4\sqrt{2}$
We also have $f(8) = 8^2 + 2\sqrt{8} = 64 + 2 \cdot 2\sqrt{2} = 64 + 4\sqrt{2}$
We subtract $8 + 4\sqrt{2} - (64 + 4\sqrt{2}) = 8 + 4\sqrt{2} - 64 - 4\sqrt{2} = \boxed{-56}$.
Let $x$ be the number of dollars Susie Q invested at the Pretty Penny Bank
Then she invested $1000 - x$ at the Five and Dime Bank
After two years, her account at the Pretty Penny Bank has grown to $x \cdot 1.03^2$, and her account at the Five and Dime Bank has grown to $(1000 - x) \cdot 1.05^2$
Therefore, \[x \cdot 1.03^2 + (1000 - x) \cdot 1.05^2 = 1090.02.\]We see that $x \cdot 1.03^2 + (1000 - x) \cdot 1.05^2 = 1.0609x + 1102.5 - 1.1025x = 1102.5 - 0.0416x$, so \[1102.5 - 0.0416x = 1090.02.\]Then \[x = \frac{1102.5 - 1090.02}{0.0416} = \boxed{300}.\]
$f(-1)=(-1)^2-2(-1)=1+2=\boxed{3}$.
The slope between the first two points must be the same as the slope between the second two points, because all three points lie on the same line
We thus have the equation $\frac{k-6}{6-(-1)}=\frac{3-k}{20-6}$
Solving for $k$ yields $k=\boxed{5}$.
If 12 centimeters represents 72 kilometers, then 1 centimeter represents 6 kilometers
So 17 centimeters represents $17 \times 6 = \boxed{102}$ kilometers.
On the first day, $1+2=3$ students know the secret
On the second day, $1+2+4=7$ students know the secret
On the third day, $1+2+4+8=15$ students know the secret
Notice that each of these sums is one less than the next power of 2
Therefore, on the $n$th day, $1+2+\cdots+2^n=2^{n+1}-1$ students know the secret
Setting $2^{n+1}-1=1023$, we find $2^{n+1}=1024\implies n+1=10\implies n=9$
We counted Monday as the first day, so the eighth day is Monday and the ninth day is $\boxed{\text{Tuesday}}$.
Note: To show that $1+2+\cdots+2^n=2^{n+1}-1$, define the sum to be $s$ and multiply both sides of   \[
s=1+2+\cdots+2^n,
\]by 2 to find \[
2s=2+4+\cdots+2^{n+1}.
\]Subtract the first equation from the second to obtain $s=2^{n+1}-1$.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives $y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3$, which is in slope-intercept form
The coefficient of $x$ is the desired slope, $\boxed{-\frac32}$.
We distribute and simplify: \begin{align*}
& (2y-1)\cdot(4y^{10}+2y^9+4y^8+2y^7)\\
=& 2y\cdot(4y^{10}+2y^9+4y^8+2y^7)-(4y^{10}+2y^9+4y^8+2y^7)\\
=& 8y^{11}+4y^{10}+8y^9+4y^8\\
&-4y^{10}-2y^9-4y^8-2y^7.
\end{align*}We are left with $\boxed{8y^{11}+6y^9-2y^7}$.
Multiplying the first equation by 5 and the second equation by $-2$ gives
\begin{align*}
10x-15y&=-25,\\
-10x + 4y &=-8.\\
\end{align*}Adding the two equations gives $-11y = -33$, so $y=3$
Substituting $y=3$ in the first original equation gives $2x - 9 = -5$, so $2x = 4$ and $x = 2$
Therefore, the solution is $(x,y) = \boxed{(2,3)}$.
All three factors equal to 2, so the product is $2\cdot2\cdot2=\boxed{8}$.
Since $\sqrt{64}<\sqrt{80}<\sqrt{81}$, $\sqrt{80}$ must be a number between $8$ and $9$
Therefore, the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $\sqrt{80}$ is $\boxed{8}$.
If the quadratic equation has exactly one solution, then the discriminant, $5^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot k = 25 - 8k$, must be equal to zero
Thus, $25 - 8k = 0 \Longrightarrow k = \boxed{\frac{25}{8}}$.
We have $x=\frac{1}{2}\left((x-y)+(x+y)\right)=\frac{1}{2}(6+12)=\boxed{9}$.
Let $p$ and $q$ be the solutions the the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$
We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively, so $p+q = m/10$ and $pq = 420/10 = 42$
Since $m = 10(p+q)$, we minimize $m$ by minimizing the sum $p+q$
Since $p$ and $q$ are integers and multiply to 42, the possible values of $(p,q)$ are $(1,42),(2,21),(3,14),(6,7),(7,6),(14,3),(21,2),(42,1)$
(Note that if $p$ and $q$ are both negative, then $p+q$ is negative, so $m$ would be negative, which is excluded by the problem.) The sum $p+q$ is minimized when $(p,q) = (6,7)$ or $(7,6)$
In either case, $m = 10(p+q) = 10(6+7) = \boxed{130}.$
We have \[\displaystyle \frac{66,\!666^4}{22,\!222^4} = \left(\frac{66,\!666}{22,\!222}\right)^4 = 3^4 = \boxed{81}.\]
Completing the square, we get $x^2 + 8x = (x^2 + 8x + 16) - 16 = (x + 4)^2 - 16,$ so the smallest possible value is $\boxed{-16}.$
This is a geometric sequence with first term 3 and common ratio 2
Thus, any term in this sequence can be represented as $3\cdot2^k$ for some non-negative integer $k$, where $k+1$ represents the term number (for example, when $k=0$, $3\cdot2^k = 3$, which is the $k+1=1^\text{st}$ term of the sequence)
We need to find the smallest $k$ such that $3\cdot2^k>100$
Using trial and error, we find that $k=6$, which means that the $6+1=7^\text{th}$ day is the the one on which Jasmine has more than 100 paperclips, or $\boxed{\text{Sunday}}$.
First we find that $f(g(1)) = A(B \cdot 1) - 2B^2 = AB - 2B^2.$ Therefore, we have that $AB - 2B^2 = B(A - 2B) = 0.$ Since $B \neq 0$, we have that $A - 2B = 0,$ and $A = \boxed{2B}.$
The greatest common factor of $37a^2$ and $111a$ is $37a$
We factor $37a$ out of both terms to get\begin{align*}
37a^2 + 111a &= 37a \cdot a+ 37a \cdot 3\\
&=\boxed{37a(a+3)}
\end{align*}
From the information given, we have $x^2 = 2x + 48$
Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$, which we can factor as $(x+6)(x-8) = 0$
Therefore, $x = -6\text{ or }8$
Since we want the lesser, $\boxed{-6}$ is our answer.
First, simplify $\sqrt[3]{16}=\sqrt[3]{2^3\cdot2}=2\sqrt[3]{2}$
Substituting this, the fraction becomes: $$\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2}+2\sqrt[3]{2}}=\frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{2}}$$ To rationalize this, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by something that will eliminate the cube root in the denominator
If we multiply $\sqrt[3]{2}$, by $\sqrt[3]{4}$, then the result will be $\sqrt[3]{2}\cdot\sqrt[3]{4}=\sqrt[3]{2\cdot4}=\sqrt[3]{8}=2$
So, multiply the expression above by $\dfrac{\sqrt[3]{4}}{\sqrt[3]{4}}$
$$\frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{2}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt[3]{4}}{\sqrt[3]{4}}=\frac{\sqrt[3]{4}}{3\sqrt[3]{8}}=\boxed{\frac{\sqrt[3]{4}}{6}}$$
We can find $x$ by taking four times the second equation plus the first:
$4(7x+y)+(9x-4y)=28x+9x=37x=4(17)+6=74\implies x=2$.
Substituting into the second equation, we can find $y$:
$7x+y=17\implies y=17-7x=17-7(2)=3$.
Thus our answer is $\boxed{(2,3)}$.
Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this polynomial
Therefore, $r_1+r_2=13$ and $r_1r_2=4$
Notice that $r_1^2+2r_1r_2+r_2^2=169$
This means that the sum of the squares of the roots can be obtained by subtracting the term containing the product of $r_1$ and $r_2$, so $r_1^2+r_2^2=169-2(4)=\boxed{161}$.
Let $m$ denote the number of male members and $f$ the number of female members
The sum of the ages of the female members is $40f$ and the sum of the ages of the male members is $25m$
The sum of the ages of all the members is $40f+25m$, and the total number of members is $f+m$
Since the average age for all the members is $30$, we have \[
\frac{40f+25m}{f+m}=30.
\] Multiply both sides by $f+m$ to get \[
40f+25m=30f+30m.
\] Collecting like terms we find $10f=5m$ so $f/m=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
Either 4 or 5 is closest to $\sqrt[3]{100}$, since $4^3=64$ and $5^3=125$
Since $4.5^3=91.125<100$, $\sqrt[3]{100}$ is closer to $\boxed{5}$ than to 4.
Writing everything in terms of prime factorizations, the given expression is \[\sqrt{7 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 3\cdot 7 \cdot x^3} = \sqrt{(2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7^2 \cdot x^2) \cdot (5 \cdot x)} = \boxed{42x\sqrt{5x}}.\]
Expanding the product on the right, we have $x^2 + 4x + 3 = -(x^2 + 8x + 15),$ so $x^2 + 4x + 3 + (x^2 + 8x + 15) = 0$
Simplifying the left side gives $2x^2 + 12x + 18 = 0.$ Dividing by 2, we have $x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0$, so $(x + 3)(x + 3) = 0.$ The only solution for $x$ is $\boxed{-3}.$
If Marika is 8 years old, and her father is four times her age, then her father is $4\cdot 8 = 32$ years old
So now $x$ years after 2004, Marika will be $8+x$ years old and her father will be $32+x$ years old
If the father's age is three times Marika's age then: \begin{align*}
32+x &= 3(8+x)\\
32+x &= 24+3x\\
2x &= 8\\
\end{align*}So the year is $2004+4 = \boxed{2008}$.
Because the constant terms of both polynomials in the product are positive, are the same, and multiply to 4, they must each equal $\sqrt{4} = \boxed{2}$.
Cubing both sides of the equation $1\text{ yd.}=3\text{ ft.}$, we find that $1\text{ yd.}^3=27\text{ ft.}^3$
Therefore, there are $27\cdot5$ cubic feet in 5 cubic yards
Multiplying the number of cubic feet by the cost per cubic foot, we find that the total cost is $27\cdot5\cdot6=27\cdot30=\boxed{810}$ dollars.
The train travels 1 mile in 1 minute 30 seconds
Then it will travel 2 miles in 3 minutes
Since 60 minutes contains 20 groups of 3 minutes, the train will travel $20 \times 2 = \boxed{40}$ miles in 1 hour.
We use the distance formula: $\sqrt{((-1) - 2)^2 + ((-1) - 2)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \boxed{3\sqrt{2}}$.
- OR -
We note that the points $(2, 2)$, $(-1, -1)$, and $(2, -1)$ form an isosceles right triangle (a 45-45-90 triangle) with legs of length 3
Therefore, the hypotenuse has length $\boxed{3\sqrt{2}}$.
First, solve the inequality so that only the absolute value quantity is on the left and the constant value is on the right.
\begin{align*}
2|x| + 7&< 17\\
2|x|&<10\\
|x|&<5
\end{align*}To solve the inequality which has an absolute value in it, we must turn this into two different inequalities, one as normal, one with a reversed sign and opposite resulting value
Both will have the absolute value removed.
\begin{align*}
x &< 5 \\
x &> -5
\end{align*}Since we need the least integer value of $x$, and $x$ has to be $\textbf{greater than }$ -5, the next smallest integer is $\boxed{-4}$.
We know that $4\oslash x = (\sqrt{2(4)+x})^3=27$
Taking the cube root of both sides, we have $\sqrt{8+x}=3$
Squaring both sides, we have $8+x=9$, to give us our answer of $x=\boxed{1}$.
Using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{ - b \pm \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac} }{2a}$, we can find the roots of the quadratic
We find that $x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25-4c}}{2}$
Thus, setting our two expressions for $x$ equal to each other, we find that  \begin{align*}
\frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25-4c}}{2} &= \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{c}}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \\
25 - 4c &= c \quad \Rightarrow \\
c &= \boxed{5}.
\end{align*}
Annie and Barbara will be meeting up at the midpoint of $(6,-20)$ and $(1, 14)$
We only need to find the $y$-coordinate of the midpoint since the problem says they only walk upwards from the midpoint to get to Charlie's location
(If you want, you can verify that the $x$-coordinate of the midpoint equals $7/2$.) The $y$-coordinate of the midpoint is $\frac{-20+14}{2}=-3$
To get to Charlie at $y=2$, the girls walk $2-(-3)=\boxed{5}$ units upward.
$\frac{1}{25}$ is equal to $5^{-2}$, so we have $5^{2n+1}=5^{-2}$
This gives us $2n+1=-2$
Solving for $n$ gives us $n=\boxed{-\frac{3}{2}}$.
We multiply both sides of the equation by $10x$ to clear the fractions, leaving us with $2x^2 + 2 = 5x$
Rearranging the terms, we have $2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0$
We can now solve for $x$ by factoring: $(2x - 1)(x - 2) = 0$
We could also use the quadratic formula:  $$x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(2)(2)}}{4}.$$Either way, we find that $x = 1/2$ or $x = 2$
Since we want the largest value of $x$, our answer is $\boxed 2$.
$\textbf{Solution 1}$: Let the three numbers be $a$, $b$, and $c$, and WLOG assume that $a\le b \le c$
We have the three equations \begin{align*}
a+b+c&=67\\
c-b&=7\\
b-a&=3
\end{align*} From the second equation, we have $c=b+7$
Substituting this into the first equation to eliminate $c$, we have $a+b+(b+7)=67\Rightarrow a+2b=60$
Adding this last equation to the third equation, we have $a+2b+b-a=60+3\Rightarrow b=21$
Substituting this value into the second equation to find $c$, we get $c=b+7=28$
Thus, the largest number is $\boxed{28}$.
$\textbf{Solution 2}$: Let the middle number be $x.$ Then, the largest number is $x+7$ and the smallest number is $x-3.$ The numbers have a sum of $67,$ so we have the equation $$(x-3) + (x) + (x+7) = 67.$$ Simplifying, we get $$3x + 4 = 67$$ $$\implies x = 21.$$ So, the largest number is $x+7 = 21+7 = \boxed{28}.$
On Monday, David produces $w\ \frac{\text{widgets}}{\text{hour}} \cdot t\ \text{hours} = wt\ \text{widgets}$.
On Tuesday, David produces $(w+4)\ \frac{\text{widgets}}{\text{hour}} \cdot (t-2)\ \text{hours} = (w+4)(t-2)\ \text{widgets}$.
Substituting $w = 2t$, the difference in output between Monday and Tuesday is  \begin{align*}wt - (w+4)(t-2) &= (2t)t - ((2t) + 4)(t-2) \\ &= 2t^2 - (2t^2 + 4t - 4t - 8) \\&= \boxed{8}
\end{align*}widgets.
We complete the square
First, we factor 3 out of the terms $3x^2 - 6x$ to get $3(x^2 - 2x)$
We can square $x - 1$ to get $x^2 - 2x + 1$, so $3(x^2 - 2x) = 3[(x - 1)^2 - 1] = 3(x - 1)^2 - 3$, and \[3(x^2 - 2x) - 2 = 3(x - 1)^2 - 3 - 2 = 3(x - 1)^2 - 5.\]We see that $a = 3$, $h = 1$, and $k = -5$, so $a + h + k = 3 + 1 + (-5) = \boxed{-1}$.
Consider the expression $P(a) = (a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3$ as a polynomial in $a$
It follows that $P(-b) = (b -b + c)^3 - (-b)^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 0$, so $a+b$ is a factor of the polynomial $P(a)$
By symmetry, $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)$ divides into the expression $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3$; as both expressions are of degree $3$ in their variables, it follows that $$(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = k(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 150 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 5,$$ where we can determine that $k = 3$ by examining what the expansion of $(a+b+c)^3$ will look like
Since $a,b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a+b$, $b+c$, and $c+a$ must all be greater than $1$, so it follows that $\{a+b, b+c, c+a\} = \{2,5,5\}$
Summing all three, we obtain that $$(a+b) + (b+c) + (c+a) = 2(a+b+c) = 2 + 5 + 5 = 12,$$ so $a+b+c = \boxed{6}$.
We have $f(3) = 2(3^2) - 4\cdot 3 + 9 = 18 - 12 + 9 = 15$ and $f(-3) = 2(-3)^2 - 4(-3) + 9 = 18 +12+9 = 39$
So, we have $2f(3)+3f(-3) = 2(15) + 3(39) = 30 + 117 = \boxed{147}$.
Since $(4, -3)$ lies on the line, we plug $x = 4$ and $y = -3$ into the equation to get $1 - 4k = -3\cdot -3 \Rightarrow k = \boxed{-2}$.
The laws of exponents give us $5^65^w=5^{6+w}$
And, because $25=5^2$, we have $5^{6+w}=5^2$
It follows that $6+w=2$
Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us $w=\boxed{-4}$.
The slope of the given line is $-\frac23$, and the line through the points must have the same slope
This means that \[
\frac{17-(-9)}{j-2}=-\frac23
\] We can multiply out denominators to get $3(26)=-2(j-2)$, or $-39=j-2$ and $j=\boxed{-37}$.
The smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $-2.4$ is $-2$
Therefore, $\lceil-2.4\rceil=\boxed{-2}$.
We solve the equation $f(x) = 0$ on the domains $x \le 1$ and $x > 1.$
If $x \le 1,$ then $f(x) = -x - 3,$ so we want to solve $-x - 3 = 0.$ The solution is $x = -3,$ which satisfies $x \le 1.$
If $x > 1,$ then $f(x) = \frac{x}{2} + 1,$ so we want to solve $\frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0.$ The solution is $x = -2,$ but this value does not satisfy $x > 1.$
Therefore, the only solution is $x = \boxed{-3}.$
The degree of the polynomial is the degree of the highest term
Since the degree of $3x^2 +11$ is 2 and since $(x^a)^{12} = x^{12a}$ for any positive constant $a$, the answer is $2 \cdot 12 = \boxed{24}$.
Factor the radicand, to yield $\sqrt[3]{24a^4b^6c^{11}} = \sqrt[3]{(2^3a^3b^6c^9)3ac^2} = 2ab^2c^3\sqrt[3]{3ac^2}$
The sum of the exponents of $a$, $b$, and $c$ outside the radical is $1+2+3=\boxed{6}$.
We can see that $(x - 5x + 12)^2$ must be nonnegative
Thus $(x - 5x + 12)^2 + 1 > 0$
But clearly, $-|x|$ is nonpositive
Thus there are $\boxed{0}$ solutions to the given equation.
Let the sequence be denoted  \[a, ar, ar^2, ar^3,\dots\]with $ar = 2$ and $ar^3 = 6$
Then $r^2 = 3$ and $r = \sqrt{3}$ or $r = -\sqrt{3}$
Therefore  $a = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$ or $a =
-\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$, which is choice $\boxed{B}$.
Plugging in the given values yields $-a-b^3+ab=-(-3)-2^3+(-3)(2)=3-8-6=\boxed{-11}$.
Let the rate that hose $A$ fills the pool be equal to $A$, and similarly for hoses $B$ and $C$
Then, let $P$ be equal to the volume of the pool
From the given information, we can write the equation $P=4(A+B)$, which just says the pool volume is equal to the rate it is being filled, multiplied by the time taken to fill it
We can rewrite this as $\frac{P}{4}=A+B$
Doing this with the rest of the given information, we can write three equations: $$\frac{P}{4}=A+B$$ $$\frac{P}{5}=A+C$$ $$\frac{P}{6}=B+C$$ Adding these three equations, we can simplify as shown: \begin{align*}
\frac{P}{4}+\frac{P}{5}+\frac{P}{6}&=(A+B)+(A+C)+(B+C)\\
\Rightarrow\qquad \frac{15P}{60}+\frac{12P}{60}+\frac{10P}{60}&=2(A+B+C)\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 37P&=120(A+B+C)\\
\Rightarrow\qquad P&=\frac{120}{37}(A+B+C)
\end{align*} Looking carefully at the final expression here, we can see that $A+B+C$ is the rate that the pool would be filled with all three hoses working together
So, $\frac{120}{37}\approx \boxed{3.24}$ is equal to the number of hours it would take all three hoses to fill the pool.
Substituting $x = a+7$ gives $x-a + 3 = (a+7) - a + 3 = a-a + 7+3 = \boxed{10}$.
We first deal with the denominator of this fraction by multiplying $6$ by $\frac{5}{5}$ and then subtracting $\frac{2}{5}$ from the resulting fraction to get: $$x = \dfrac{35}{6-\frac{2}{5}}= \dfrac{35}{\frac{30}{5}-\frac{2}{5}} = \dfrac{35}{\frac{28}{5}}.$$  Since dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, we have that $$x=\dfrac{35}{\frac{28}{5}}=35 \cdot \frac{5}{28} = 5 \cdot \frac{5}{4} = \boxed{\frac{25}{4}}.$$
Because \[
1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2},
\]$1+2+ \cdots + n$ divides the positive integer $6n$ if and only if \[
\frac{6n}{n(n+1)/2} = \frac{12}{n+1}\ \text{is an integer.}
\]There are  $\boxed{5}$ such positive values of $n$, namely,  1, 2, 3, 5,  and 11.
We have $y=\frac{1}{2}\left((x+y)-(x-y)\right)=\frac{1}{2}(6-12)=\boxed{-3}$.
We begin by writing $-4z^2+20z-6$ as $-(4z^2-20z+6)$
We then complete the square for $4z^2-20z+6$.
We know that the binomial to be squared will be in terms of $2z+b$ because $(2z)^2=4z^2$
By expanding $(2z+b)^2$, we get $4z^2+4bz+b^2$
We get that $4bz=-20z$, so $b=-5$, which gives us $(2z-5)^2=4z^2-20z+25$.
Therefore, $-(4z^2-20z+6)=-(4z^2-20z+25-19)=-[(2z-5)^2-19]=-(2z-5)^2+19$.
Since $(2z-5)^2$ is at least zero because it is a square of a real number, $-(2z-5)^2$ is at most 0
Therefore, the maximum value of $-4z^2+20z-6$ is $\boxed{19}$.
We have $g(2) = 2(2^2) + 2(2) - 1 = 8+4-1=11$, so \[g(g(2)) = g(11) = 2(11)^2 +2(11) -1 = 242 +22 -1 =\boxed{263}.\]
We can make use of the fact that the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$
Choosing $a$, $b$, and $c$ so that $-b/a=11/12$ and $c/a=1/6$, we find that the fractions are the solutions to $12x^2 - 11x + 2=0$
Factoring this, we get \[ 12x^2 - 11x + 2 = (3x - 2)(4x - 1)
\] Therefore, the solutions of $12x^2 - 11x + 2=0$ are $x=\frac{1}{4}$ and $x=\frac{2}{3}$
The smaller of these fractions is $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
An alternative way to obtain the equation $12x^2 - 11x + 2=0$ is to begin with the given equations $x+y=\frac{11}{12}$ and $xy=\frac{1}{6}$
Solve the first equation for $y$ and substitute $y=\frac{11}{12}-x$ into the second equation
Distributing, clearing denominators, and rearranging gives $12x^2 - 11x + 2=0$
Then we proceed as before.
We have $m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2-x_1} = \dfrac{-5-5}{2-(-3)} = \dfrac{-10}{5} = \boxed{-2}$.
We are summing up $2+4+6+\cdots+60$
Factoring out a 2 and simplifying, we have $2(1+2+3+\cdots+30)=2\cdot\frac{30\cdot31}{2}=\boxed{930}$.
Let $a$ denote the leftmost digit of $N$ and let $x$ denote the three-digit number obtained by removing $a$
Then $N=1000a+x=9x$ and it follows that $1000a=8x$
Dividing both sides by 8 yields $125a=x$
All the values of $a$ in the range 1 to 7 result in three-digit numbers, hence there are $\boxed{7}$ values for $N$.
Without loss of generality, let $x_1$ be the smaller root
In the quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$, the roots sum to $\frac{-b}{a}$ and multiply to $\frac{c}{a}$
Therefore, $x_1x_2=\frac{24}{1}=24$ and $x_1+x_2=m$
Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ must be integers, there are only 4 positive integer pairs of $(x_1,x_2)$ such that the two multiply to 24 -- $(1,24), (2,12), (3,8), (4,6)$ -- and the 4 corresponding negations of those values
Note that for each of these $(x_1,x_2)$, each $m=x_1+x_2$ is distinct
Because $x_1+x_2=x_2+x_1$, the value of $m$ does not change if the order of the roots are reversed, so there are only $4+4=\boxed{8}$ possible values of $m$.
In this particular case, the fraction will be undefined only if its denominator is equal to zero
Because of this, we can ignore the numerator
We start by setting the binomial in the denominator equal to 0: \begin{align*} 8x^2-65x+8=0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (8x-1)(x-8)=0
\end{align*} We find that the two possible values for $x$ are $\frac18$ and $8$
Since the question asks for the largest value, the final solution is $\boxed{8}$.
The price of all the shirts without sales tax and the entrance fee must be at most $(130-2)/1.05=121.91$ dollars
Since Alec must buy 14 shirts, and since $121.91/14\approx8.71$, the most each shirt can cost is $\boxed{8}$ dollars.
Since both lines intersect at the point $(-4,-7)$, line $n$ must pass through this point
We can substitute these coordinates into the equation $y=kx-7$ and solve for $k$ as shown: \begin{align*}
-7&=k(-4)-7\\
\Rightarrow\qquad -7&=-4k-7\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 0&=-4k\\
\Rightarrow\qquad \boxed{0}&=k
\end{align*}
Completing the square gives us $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - 4 = 0$
Rearranging terms, we have $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 4$
It follows that the square of the radius is 4, so the radius must be $\boxed{2}$.
We have $g(-5) = 5(-5) + 2(-5)^2 = -25 + 50 = 25$, so $f(g(-5)) = f(25) = 3 - \!\sqrt{25} = 3-5=\boxed{-2}$.
We have $2 \star 10 = \frac{2+10}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4$
Then $4 \star 5 = \frac{4+5}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = \boxed{3}$.
Notice that multiplying all three of the original equations together tells us that $(a^2b^2c^2)/(abc) = 6$, which implies $abc=6$
Rewriting the first and third equations as $b = a^2$ and $c = \sqrt{3a}$ and plugging these into $abc=6$ yields $a \cdot a^2\cdot \sqrt{3a} = 6$
By squaring both sides of the equation, we obtain $3a^7 = 36 \Rightarrow a = \boxed{12^{1/7}}$.
The points of intersection of the line $y = 5$ and $y = x^2 + 3x + 2$ are found when $x^2 + 3x + 2 = 5$
Thus we have the quadratic  $x^2 + 3x -3=0$
By the quadratic formula,  $$x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot -3}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{21}}{2}$$We want to find the difference of these roots to find the difference of the x-coordinates of the points of intersection, which will give a side length of the square
The difference is $2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{2} = \sqrt{21}$.
Therefore, the area of the square is the square of the side length, which is $(\sqrt{21})^2 = \boxed{21}$.
We make $a+\sqrt{d}=\sqrt{53+20\sqrt{7}}$
Squaring both sides, we get: \begin{align*}
a^2+2a\sqrt{d}+d=(a^2+d)+\sqrt{4a^2 \cdot d}=53+20\sqrt{7}=53+\sqrt{2800}\\
\end{align*}We set the terms with radicals equal to each other, and ones without radicals equal
From this, we get that $a^2+d=53$ and $\sqrt{4a^2 \cdot d}=\sqrt{2800}$, so $4a^2 \cdot d =2800$
Solving, we get that $a=5$, and $d=28$.
Therefore, $\sqrt{53+20\sqrt{7}}=5+\sqrt{28}=5+2\sqrt{7}$
$a=5$, $b=2$, and $c=7$
$a+b+c=5+2+7=\boxed{14}$.
We can write the equation as
\[x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + 34 = 0.\]Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0.\]Hence, $x = 5$ and $y = -3,$ so $x + y = \boxed{2}.$
We will herein give the weight of each color ball a variable determined by the first letter of the color
We have $3G=6B\implies 1G=2B$, $2Y=5B\implies 1Y=2.5B$, and $6B=4W\implies 1W=1.5B$
Thus $4G+2Y+2W=4(2B)+2(2.5B)+2(1.5B)=8B+5B+3B=16B$, and our answer is $\boxed{16}$.
We'll start with rods
The first row has 3 rods, the second row has 6 rods, and continuing down, we see that the next rows have 9, 12, 15, and so on rods
So the total number of rods in an eight-row triangle is $$
3 + 6 + 9 + \cdots + 24 = 3(1+2+3+\cdots+8) = 3(36) = 108.
$$For the connectors, note that in an $n$-row triangle, the connectors form a triangle which has $n+1$ rows
For example, a two-row triangle has three rows of connectors, and $1+2+3 = 6$ connectors
So an eight-row triangle has $1+2+3+\cdots+9 = 45$ connectors
We have a total of $108+45 = \boxed{153}$ pieces.
First, we move all terms to one side to get $5x^2 - 3x - 5 = 0.$ Seeing that factoring will not work, we apply the Quadratic Formula: \begin{align*}
x &= \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(5)(-5)}}{2 (5)}\\
&= \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 100}}{10} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{109}}{10}.
\end{align*}Now we see that $10x = 3 \pm \sqrt{109}$, so $(10x - 3)^2 = \boxed{109}.$
Alternatively, from the equation $5x^2 - 3x - 5 = 0$, $5x^2 - 3x = 5$
Then $(10x - 3)^2 = 100x^2 - 60x + 9 = 20(5x^2 - 3x) + 9 = 20 \cdot 5 + 9 = \boxed{109}$.
The smallest sum that can be obtained from $n$ consecutive positive integers is $1 + 2 + \dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so we want to find the largest $n$ such that $n(n + 1)/2 < 400$.
Testing, we find that when $n = 27$, $n(n + 1)/2 = 27 \cdot 28/2 = 378$, and when $n = 28$, $n(n + 1)/2 = 28 \cdot 29/2 = 406$, so the largest such $n$ is $n = \boxed{27}$.
We add up the fractions of non-red bows and get $\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{10}=\frac{2+5+1}{10}=\frac{8}{10}=\frac{4}{5}$
So the 30 bows make up $1-\frac{4}{5}=\frac{1}{5}$ of the total bows, and the total number of bows is $5\times30=150$
The green bows are $\frac{1}{10}$ of the total, and $\frac{1}{10}\times150=15$, so there are $\boxed{15}$ green bows.
Plot the four points to find a pair of adjacent vertices
Line segment $AB$ is one of the sides of the square, so the area of the square is $AB^2$
By the Pythagorean theorem, $AB^2=(-5-0)^2+(-1-0)^2=\boxed{26}$ square units.

Since the seventh term is halfway between the first term and thirteenth term, it is simply the average of these terms, or \[\frac{7/9 + 4/5}{2} = \boxed{\frac{71}{90}}.\]
Let $x$ equal the number of hours that you felt good riding
Then, $x$ hours were spent traveling at 20 mph, and $8-x$ hours were spent traveling at 12 mph
During this time, a total of 122 miles was traveled
Remembering that $d=r\cdot t$, we can add the two distances, set this equal to 122 miles, and solve for $x$ as shown: \begin{align*}
20(x)+12(8-x)&=122\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 20x+96-12x&=122\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 8x&=26\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x&=26/8=\boxed{\frac{13}{4}}
\end{align*}
Let $\log_{3}{81}=a$
Then $3^a=81=3^4$, so $a=4$
Let $\log_{3}{\frac{1}{9}}=b$
Then $\frac{1}{9}=3^b$
Express $\frac{1}{9}$ as a power of $3$: $\frac{1}{9}=\frac{1}{3^2}=3^{-2}$
Thus $3^b=3^{-2}$ and $b=-2$
We want to find $\log_{3}{81}-\log_{3}{\frac{1}{9}}=a-b=(4)-(-2)=\boxed{6}$.
Factoring, we find that $x^2 + 15x + 54 = (x + 9)(x + 6)$ and $x^2 - 17x + 72 = (x - 9)(x - 8)$
We can see that $b = 9$, therefore $a = 6$ and $c = 8$, and $a + b + c = \boxed{23}.$
Since both of these points lie on the line, plugging them into the equation of the line will produce a true statement
Thus $(-3, 5)$ gives us $5 = -3m + b$ and $(0, -4)$ gives us $-4 = b$
So we now know what $b$ is and can plug it back into the first equation to get $5 = -3m - 4$
So $m = -3$ and $m + b = \boxed{-7}$.
The givens tell us that $\frac{x+y}{2}=18$ and $\sqrt{xy}=\sqrt{92}$, or $x+y=36$ and $xy=92$
$(x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2$, so  \[
x^2+y^2=(x+y)^2-2xy=36^2-2\cdot92=1296-184=\boxed{1112}
Combining the fractions on the left gives $\dfrac{n+3}{n+1} = 3$
Multiplying both sides by $n+1$ gives $n+3 = 3(n+1)$
Expanding the right side gives $n+3 = 3n+3$
Subtracting $n$ and 3 from both sides gives $0=2n$, so $n=\boxed{0}$.
$\frac{3+x(3+x)-3^2}{x-3+x^2}=\frac{3+(-2)(3+(-2))-3^2}{-2-3+(-2)^2}=\frac{-8}{-1}=\boxed{8}$
By the distance formula,  \begin{align*}
AP &= \sqrt{(4-0)^2 + (2-0)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4} = 2\sqrt{5} \\
BP &= \sqrt{(4-10)^2 + (2-0)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 4} = 2\sqrt{10} \\
CP &= \sqrt{(4-3)^2 + (2-5)^2} = \sqrt{1+9} = \sqrt{10}
\end{align*}Hence, $AP + BP + CP = 2\sqrt{5} + 3\sqrt{10}$, and $m+n = \boxed{5}$.
We have $\frac{4}{x^2} = \frac{x}{16}$
Cross-multiplying gives $x^3 = 64$, or $x=\boxed{4}$.
Not wanting to multiply out a product with 46 factors, we first see what happens when we square $(1+i)/\sqrt{2}$
We have  \[
\left(\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 =\frac{1+2i+i^2}{(\sqrt{2})^2}= \frac{1+2i-1}{2} = i.
\] So $\left(\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{46}=\left(\left(\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2\right)^{23}=i^{23}=(i^{20})(i^3)=i^3=\boxed{-i}$.
Rewrite the left-hand side of the equation as $3\cdot 9^4=3\cdot (3^2)^4=3\cdot 3^8=3^9$
Solving $3^9=3^x$, we find $x=\boxed{9}$.
Begin by assigning variables
Let $p$=the cost of the pen and $i$=the cost of the ink
From what we are given,
\begin{align*}
p+i&=1.10,\\
p&=1+i.
\end{align*} Substituting for $p$ in the first equation, we find: $1+i+i=1.10$, so $2i=.10$ and $i=.05$
Therefore, $p=1+i=\boxed{1.05}$ dollars.
We start by finding the inverse function of $f$
By definition, we know that $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$, so $$\frac{f^{-1}(x)-3}{f^{-1}(x)-4} = x.$$We can solve this equation for $f^{-1}(x)$
First we multiply both sides by $f^{-1}(x)-4$: $$f^{-1}(x)-3 = x\cdot(f^{-1}(x)-4).$$Then we expand: $$f^{-1}(x)-3 = x\cdot f^{-1}(x)-4x.$$Then we rearrange so as to group all terms involving $f^{-1}(x)$ on the left side: $$f^{-1}(x)-x\cdot f^{-1}(x) = 3-4x.$$We can factor on the left side: $$f^{-1}(x)\cdot (1-x) = 3-4x.$$Finally, we divide both sides by $1-x$ to obtain our inverse function, $$f^{-1}(x) = \frac{3-4x}{1-x}.$$This function is defined for all $x$ except $\boxed{1}$.
Since the axis of symmetry is vertical and the vertex is $(3,2)$, the parabola may also be written as  \[y=a(x-3)^2+2\]for some value of $a$
Plugging the point $(1,0)$ into this expression gives  \[0=a(1-3)^2+2=4a+2.\]This tells us $a=-\frac12$.
Our equation is  \[y=-\frac12(x-3)^2+2.\]Putting it into $y=ax^2+bx+c$ form requires expanding the square, so we get  \[y=-\frac12(x^2-6x+9)+2=-\frac12 x^2+3x-\frac52.\]Our answer is $(a, b, c) = \boxed{\left(-\frac{1}{2}, 3, -\frac{5}{2}\right)}.$
In order to use $g(2x-5) = 3x + 9$ to evaluate $g(1)$, we find the value of $x$ such that $2x-5 =1$
Solving this equation gives $x=3$, so letting $x=3$ in $g(2x-5) = 3x+9$ gives $g(1) = \boxed{18}$.
The number of people painting the house and the amount of time it takes are inversely proportional
This means that if we let $n$ be the number of people, and $t$ be the time taken, the product $nt$ is a constant
Since 4 people can paint the house in 6 hours, $nt=(4)(6)=24$
Therefore, if three people were painting the same house, $nt=3t=24$, and $t=\boxed{8}$.
We know that when $a+b=24$, $a-b=6$
Adding these two equations gives $2a=30$, or $a=15$, and subtracting the second from the first gives $2b=18$, or $b=9$
Since $a$ and $b$ are inversely proportional, the product $ab$ is always the same
Call this product $C$
From the values of $a$ and $b$ we were given, we know that $C=ab=(15)(9)=135$
To find the value of $b$ when $a=5$, we solve the equation $(5)(b)=135$
This gives $b=\boxed{27}$.
If $d \neq 0$, the value of the expression can be increased by interchanging 0 with the value of $d$
Therefore the maximum value must occur when $d=0$
If $a = 1$, the value is $c$, which is 2 or 3
If $b=1$, the value is $c \cdot a = 6$
If $c=1$, the value is $a^b$, which is $2^3 = 8$ or $3^2 = 9$
Thus the maximum value is $\boxed{9}$.
There are $n+1$ terms in the sequence $x, x+2, x+4, \ldots, x+2n$, and either all of them are even or all of them are odd
If they were all even, then their cubes would be even and the sum of their cubes would be even
Therefore, all the terms are odd.
If the sequence contains both positive and negative terms, then it contains more negative terms than positive terms, since the sum of the cubes of the terms is $-1197$
Also, all of the positive terms will be additive opposites of the first several negative terms, so we may first look for consecutive negative odd numbers whose cubes sum to $-1197$
If we add cubes until we pass $-1197$, we find that  \[
(-1)^3+(-3)^3+(-5)^3+(-7)^3+(-9)^3=-1225.
\] Since 1197 is 28 less than 1225, we would like to drop two terms than sum to $-28$
We find that first two terms sum to $-28$, which gives \[
(-9)^3+(-7)^3+(-5)^3=-1197.
\] Filling in negative and positive terms that sum to 0, we find that the possibilities for the original arithmetic sequence are  \begin{align*}
-9, &-7, -5, \text{ and} \\
-9, &-7, -5, -3, -1, 1, 3.
\end{align*} The number of terms is $n + 1$, and $n > 3$, so $n + 1 = 7$, or $n = \boxed{6}$.
We want to find the common difference, say $d$
We observe that \begin{align*}
a_{101}& + a_{102} + \dots + a_{200} \\
&= (a_1 + 100d)
+ (a_2+ 100d) + \ldots + (a_{100} + 100d) \\
&= a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_{100} + 10000d.
\end{align*}Thus $200=100+10000d$  and  $d=\frac{100}{10000}=\boxed{\frac{1}{100}}$.
Let the number of lollipops Joann ate on the first day be $a-12$, so she ate $a-6$ lollipops on the second day, $a$ on the third, and so on, eating $(a-12)+(5-1)\cdot 6=a+12$ lollipops on the last day
The total number of lollipops is $5a$, which we are told is 100
Thus, $5a=100$ and $a=20$
Since $a$ is the number of lollipops Joann ate on the third day, our answer is $\boxed{20}$ lollipops.
We could cross-multiply, but that looks terrifying
Instead, we start by factoring each of the quadratics, hoping that we'll get some convenient cancellation
Factoring each of the 4 quadratics gives  \[\frac{(r-4)(r-1)}{(r-7)(r-1)} = \frac{(r-5)(r+3)}{(r-5)(r+4)}.\]Canceling the common factors on each side gives us  \[\frac{r-4}{r-7} = \frac{r+3}{r+4}.\]Cross-multiplying gives $(r-4)(r+4) = (r+3)(r-7)$
Expanding both sides gives $r^2 - 16 = r^2 - 4r - 21$
Solving for $r$ gives $r=\boxed{-5/4}$.
Let the smallest integer be $x$
Then the others are $3x$ and $4x$, and the sum of the three is $8x$
So $x=\frac{72}{8}=\boxed{9}$.
In order to find $\log_{11} x$, we must first find the value of $x$
We begin by writing $\log_5 (x+4)=3$ in exponential form, which gives us $5^3=x+4$
Solving for $x$, we find that $x=5^3-4=125-4=121$
After plugging this value of $x$ into the second expression, we now need to find $\log_{11} 121$
Since we know that $11^2=121$, $\log_{11} 121=\boxed{2}$.
$$(-1)\Diamond 6=(-1)6^2-6+1=\boxed{-41}$$
Combining like terms, the given expression is equal to $(2+8-14)+(-4x+10x+16x)+(-6x^2-12x^2+18x^2)=\boxed{22x-4}$.
If we complete the square after bringing the $x$ and $y$ terms to the other side, we get \[(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 0.\]Squares of real numbers are nonnegative, so we need both $(x-5)^2$ and $(y+3)^2$ to be $0.$  This only happens when $x = 5$ and $y = -3.$ Thus, $x+y = 5 + (-3) = \boxed{2}.$
The graphs of $f(x),g(x),h(x)$ are all lines, and we have a segment of each, so we can extend these segments to form the superimposed graphs of $f(x),$ $g(x),$ and $h(x)$ on one set of axes:
size(150);
real ticklen=3;

We are given that $x(x+1) = 506$, so $x^2 + x = 506$, which means $x^2 + x - 506 =0$
The prime factorization of $506$ is $2\cdot 11 \cdot 23$, so we see that the quadratic factors as $(x + 23)(x-22)=0$
The positive solution is $x=22$, so the two numbers are 22 and 23
Their sum is $22+23 = \boxed{45}$.
We have $(\sqrt{x})^3=64$ and solve for $x$
$$x^\frac{3}{2}=64\qquad\Rightarrow x=64^\frac{2}{3}=(64^\frac{1}{3})^2=4^2=16$$The value of $x$ is $\boxed{16}$.
$\left( \frac{1}{2k} \right)^{-2} \cdot (-k)^3 = (2k)^2 \cdot (-k)^3 = 4k^2 \cdot (-k^3) = \boxed{-4k^5}$.
We have $4 \Delta 13 = 4^2-13=16-13=3$ and $3 \Delta 5 = 3^2-5 = 9-5=4$
Thus we are looking for $(2^3) \Delta (3^4) = 2^6-3^4 = 64-81 = \boxed{-17}$.
Note that $\frac{2^{n+4} - 2(2^n)}{2(2^{n+3})} = \frac{2^n}{2^n}\cdot\frac{2^4 - 2}{2(2^3)} = \boxed{\frac{7}{8}}$.
Let $c$ and $b$ be the number of pounds of corn and beans Shea buys, respectively
We can turn the givens into a two-variable, linear system: \begin{align*}
b+c&=24\\
45b+99c&=1809
\end{align*} We can multiply the first equation by 45 and subtract it from the second to get $(99-45)c=1809-45(24)$, which reduces to $54c=729$ or $c=13.5$
So Shea buys $\boxed{13.5\text{ pounds}}$ of corn.
We have  \[\dfrac{\sqrt[3]{5}}{\sqrt[5]{5}} = \dfrac{5^{\frac13}}{5^{\frac15}} = 5^{\frac13-\frac15} = 5^{\frac{2}{15}}.\]So, the expression equals 5 raised to the $\boxed{2/15}$ power.
If $(x,y)$ lies on the circle, so does $(x,-y),$ $(-x,-y),$ and $(-x,-y),$ (which all give the same value of $|x| + |y|$), so we can assume that $x \ge 0$ and $y \ge 0.$
Then $|x| + |y| = x + y.$  Squaring, we get
\[(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1 + 2xy.\]Note that $(x - y)^2 \ge 0.$  Expanding, we get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \ge 0,$ so $2xy \le x^2 + y^2 = 1.$  Hence,
\[1 + 2xy \le 2,\]which means $x + y \le \sqrt{2}.$  Equality occurs when $x = y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ so the maximum value of $|x| + |y|$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{2}}.$
We can multiply the second equation by 5, so that our equations are \begin{align*}
5j -42k &=1\text{, and} \\
-5j +10k &=15
\end{align*}Summing these equations gives $-32k=16$, so $k=-16/32=-1/2$
We substitute this value for $k$ into one of the equations to solve for $j$: \begin{align*}
2\left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)-j&=3 \quad \Rightarrow \\ j &= -4.
\end{align*}So the solution is $\boxed{(-4,-\frac{1}{2})}$.
Since $g(x)=\sqrt[3]{\frac{x+3}{4}}$, we know that $g(2x)=\sqrt[3]{\frac{2x+3}{4}}$
Similarly, we see that $2(g(x))=2\sqrt[3]{\frac{x+3}{4}}$
This gives us the equation \begin{align*} \sqrt[3]{\frac{2x+3}{4}}&=2\sqrt[3]{\frac{x+3}{4}}
\\\Rightarrow\qquad\left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{2x+3}{4}}\right)^3&=\left(2\sqrt[3]{\frac{x+3}{4}}\right)^3
\\\Rightarrow\qquad \frac{2x+3}{4}&=\frac{8(x+3)}{4}
\\\Rightarrow\qquad\frac{2x+3}{4}&=\frac{8x+24}{4}
\\\Rightarrow\qquad 2x+3&=8x+24
\\\Rightarrow\qquad-6x&=21
\\\Rightarrow\qquad x&=\boxed{-\frac{7}{2}}
\end{align*}
To start, note that $\frac{x}{x^{2/3}}=x^{1-\frac{2}{3}}=x^{1/3}$
Also note that we can rewrite the cube root with a fractional exponent, so $\sqrt[3]{x}=x^{1/3}$
Using these pieces of information, rewrite the given equation as: $$4x^{1/3}-2x^{1/3}=7+x^{1/3}$$ Move all $x^{1/3}$ terms to one side and simplify: \begin{align*}
2x^{1/3}-x^{1/3}&=7\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x^{1/3}&=7\\
\Rightarrow\qquad (x^{1/3})^3&=7^3\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x&=\boxed{343}
\end{align*}
Simply back up from $11$
Since $11$ is the fifth term, the first term will be $11 - 4 \cdot 1 = 7$, and the second term will be $11 - 3\cdot 1 = 8$
So the answer is $7 \cdot 8 = \boxed{56}$.
We don't know $g(x)$, so we don't have an expression we can simply stick $8$ in to get an answer
We do, however, know that $g(f(x)) =2x +3$
So, if we can figure out what to put into $f(x)$ such that $8$ is output, we can use our expression for $g(f(x))$ to find $g(8)$.
If $f(x) = 8$, then we have $x^2 -7x +18 = 8$, so $x^2 -7x +10 = 0$, so $(x-2)(x-5)=0$ which means $x=2$ or $x=5$
Since $x$ could be $2$ or $5$, we could have $g(8) = g(f(2))$ or $g(8) = g(f(5))$
Using the given expression for $g(f(x))$, the two possible values of $g(8)$ are  $g(f(2)) = 2\cdot2 +3 = 7$ and $g(f(5)) = 2\cdot5+3 = 13$
The sum of these is $7+13=\boxed{20}$.
We have $(2^2)^3 = 2^{2\cdot 3} = 2^6 = \boxed{64}$.
Since $a$ varies inversely with $b^2$, $(a)(b^2)=k$ for some constant $k$
If $a=9$ when $b=2$, then $k=(9)(2^2)=(9)(4)=36$
So if $b=3$, \begin{align*} (a)(3^2)&=36
\\ 9a&=36
\\\Rightarrow\qquad a&=\boxed{4}
\end{align*}
Let $h$ be the amount of sleep the mathematician gets and $g$ be the number of gallons of coffee he drinks
Since $g$ and $h$ are inversely proportional, that means that $gh=k$ for some constant k
From what we know about Monday, we can conclude that $k=9\cdot2=18$
Consequently, for Tuesday we have $6g=18$, so $g=\boxed{3}$.
Let $a_k$ denote the number of people in year $k$ (with initially $k=0$)
One might notice that after the leaders are kicked out, there are $a_k-5$ regular members
Then, there are $3(a_k-5)$ regular members after the new regular members join
Finally, after the new leaders are elected, we have a grand total of $3(a_k-5)+5 = 3a_k-10$ people the next year
One might wish to solve this recursion with $a_0=15$
But there is an easier way.
Notice that the number of leaders stays the same each year, and the number of regular members triples
Thus the number of regular members follows a geometric sequence
In the beginning, there are $15-5=10$ regular members
Therefore, five years later, there will be $(3^5)(10)=2430$ regular members
The total number of people will be $5+2430=\boxed{2435}$.
Let $x$ be the given number, so that $x = 2 + \frac{4}{1 + \frac{4}{\left(2 + \frac{4}{1 + \cdots}\right)}}$
The term in the parentheses is exactly the definition of $x$, so it follows that $$x = 2+\frac{4}{1 + \frac{4}{x}} = 2+\frac{4x}{x + 4}.$$ Multiplying by $(x+4)$ on both sides and simplifying gives $x(x+4) = 2(x+4) + 4x \Longrightarrow x^2 + 4x = 2x + 8 + 4x.$ Thus, we have the quadratic equation $$x^2 - 2x - 8 = (x - 4)(x+2) = 0,$$ and it follows that $x = -2, 4$
Since the given number is positive, the answer is $\boxed{4}$.
We may find Angela's balance by simply finding $\$8,\!000(1 + 0.06)^{20} \approx \$25,\!657.08.$
We may find Bob's balance by finding $\$10,\!000(1 + 20 \cdot 0.07) \approx \$24,\!000.$
Therefore, the difference between their balances is roughly $\$25,\!657.08 - \$24,\!000 \approx \boxed{\$1,\!657}.$
Call the number of one dollar bills $x$ and the number of two dollar bills $y$
We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \begin{align*}
x + y &= 49, \\
1x + 2y &= 66
\end{align*}The first equation represents the total number of dollar bills in the piggy bank, and the second equation represents how much money is in the piggy bank
Solving for $x$ in the first equation gives $x = 49 - y$
Substituting for $x$ in the second equation yields $49 - y + 2y = 66$, or $y = 17$
But $y$ is the number of two dollar bills, and the question asks for the number of one dollar bills, so solve for $x$: $x = 49 - 17$
Thus, there are $\boxed{32}$ one dollar bills.
We can rewrite the given equation as $y = -\frac{1}{2}x - \frac{17}4$
Since all lines parallel to a given one have the same slope as the given line, our answer is $\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}$.
Using the associative property and simplifying gives \begin{align*}
(15x^2) \cdot (6x) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{(3x)^2}\right)
&= (15 \cdot 6) \cdot (x^2 \cdot x) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{9x^2}\right)\\
&= \frac{90x^3}{9x^2}\\
&= 10x^{3-2} = \boxed{10x}.
\end{align*}
Recall that two lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is $-1$
The first equation is already in slope-intercept form, so we can see that its slope is 2
Subtract $ax$ and divide by 6 in the second equation to get it in slope-intercept form as well: $y=-\frac{a}{6}x+1$
The negative reciprocal of 2 is $-1/2$, so setting $-a/6=-1/2$ we find that $a=\boxed{3}$ is the value for which the two lines are perpendicular.
We have \begin{align*}
&(x^5+x^4+x+10)-(x^5+2x^4-x^3+12)\\
&=(1-1)x^5+(1-2)x^4+(0-(-1))x^3+(1-0)x+(10-12)\\
&=\boxed{-x^4+x^3+x-2}
\end{align*}
To generate the next 2-digit number on this list, we just increment the tens digit of the current one and decrement the ones
Thus the 8th number on the list will be 92
The first 3-digit number is 119, which is the 9th number in the list
Continuing the earlier pattern, the 10th is 128, and the 11th is $\boxed{137}$.
We have $$(2x)^4 + (3x)(x^3) = (2^4 \cdot x^4) + 3(x^{1+3}) = 16x^4 + 3x^4 = \boxed{19x^4}.$$
Let the two integers be $x$ and $1998-x$
The product which needs to be maximized is $1998x-x^2$
Completing the square results in $-(x-999)^2+999^2$
Since $-(x-999)^2\le 0$, the expression is maximized when $x=999$, which results in a value of $999^2=\boxed{998001}$.
The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$ is $\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)$.
Thus, the midpoint of this line segment is $\left(\frac{2+8}{2}, \frac{3+15}{2} \right)$, which simplifies to $(5,9)$
Thus, the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint is $\boxed{14}$.
The common ratio is $\frac{64}{32} = 2$
Therefore, the first term is $\frac{32}{2^3} = \frac{32}{8} = \boxed{4}$.
The slope of a line is $\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$
In this case, there is no vertical difference between points $A$ and $B$, so the line is simply a horizontal line with a slope of 0
Since the line is a horizontal line, its $y$-intercept equals the $y$-coordinate of all the other points on the line, 13
So, the sum of the slope and the $y$-intercept is $\boxed{13}$.
We have \[\text{{J}}(2,12, 9)=\frac{2}{12} + \frac{12}{9} + \frac{9}{2} =
\frac{1}{6} + \frac{4}{3} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1 + 8 + 27}{6} = \frac{36}{6} = \boxed{6}.\]
In order for the equation to have to real roots, its discriminant, $b^2-4ac=(-7)^2-4(1)(-c)=49+4c$ must be greater than zero
So we have \begin{align*}
49+4c&>0\quad\Rightarrow\\
4c&>-49\quad\Rightarrow\\
c&>\frac{-49}{4}=-12.25.
\end{align*}Since $c$ must be an integer, we have $c\ge -12$.
Now we must ensure that the roots are rational
The roots are of the form $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
Since $a$, $b$ and $c$ are integers, the roots are rational so long as $\sqrt{b^2-4ac}$ is rational, so we must have $b^2-4ac$ is a perfect square
Plugging in the values from our quadratic, we have $49+4c$ is a perfect square
Since $-12\le c \le 25$, we have $-48\le 4c\le 100$, so $1\le 49+4c\le 149$
There are $12$ possible squares between $1$ and $149$ inclusive, so we only need to check those $12$ squares to see if $c$ is an integer
But we can narrow this down further: the value of $49+4c$ must be odd, so it can only be the square of an odd integer
Thus the possible values for $49+4c$ are the squares of the odd numbers from $1$ to $11$
We solve:
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
$49+4c=1$&$\Rightarrow$&$4c=-48$&$\Rightarrow$&$c=-12$\\
$49+4c=9$&$\Rightarrow$&$4c=-40$&$\Rightarrow$&$c=-10$\\
$49+4c=25$&$\Rightarrow$&$4c=-24$&$\Rightarrow$&$c=-6$\\
$49+4c=49$&$\Rightarrow$&$4c=0$&$\Rightarrow$&$c=0$\\
$49+4c=81$&$\Rightarrow$&$4c=32$&$\Rightarrow$&$c=8$\\
$49+4c=121$&$\Rightarrow$&$4c=72$&$\Rightarrow$&$c=18$
\end{tabular}All of the values work! Their sum is $(-12)+(-10)+(-6)+0+8+18=\boxed{-2}$.
Let the side length of the equilateral triangle be $d$
$15/3=5$ Joules of energy are stored when two charges are at distance $d$, so $2\cdot5=10$ Joules are stored when they are at distance $d/2$, because energy is inversely proportional to distance
This means that in the second configuration, the pair $(A,C)$ and $(B,C)$ store 10 Joules each, and since $(A,B)$ still stores 5 Joules, the final configuration stores a total of $10+10+5=25$ Joules, which is $25-15=\boxed{10}$ Joules more than the initial configuration

If Anthony makes $2/3$ of his next $24$ attempts, he will make another $16$ free throws
Then he will have $5 + 16 = 21$ successful throws in $12 + 24 = 36$ attempts
That's a success rate of $21/36 = 7/12$, which is $58.3\%$
His success rate before was $5/12$, which is $41.6\%$
The increase is $58.3 - 41.6 = 16.7$, or $\boxed{17\%}$ to the nearest whole number.
Because the three points are on the same line, the slope between the first and second equals the slope between the first and the third
This gives us the equation: \begin{align*}
\frac{3-(-5)}{(-a+2) -3} &= \frac{2- (-5)}{(2a+3) - 3} \\
\frac{8}{-a-1} &= \frac{7}{2a} \\
8(2a) &= 7(-a-1) \\
23a &= -7 \\
&a = \boxed{\frac{-7}{23}}.
\end{align*}
Since we both earned the same amount, \begin{align*}
(t-6) (2t-5) &= (2t-8)(t-5) \\
\Rightarrow \qquad 2t^2-17t+30 &= 2t^2 - 18t+ 40.
\end{align*}Simplifying gives $t = \boxed{10}$.
Expanding, we have $45x^2 +45x + 50 = 9x^2 - 40x.$ Hence, we see that $36x^2 + 85x + 50 = (4x+5)(9x+10) = 0.$ Therefore, $x = -\dfrac{5}{4}$ or $x = -\dfrac{10}{9}.$ Of these, the greater value for $x$ is $x = \boxed{-\dfrac{10}{9}}.$
If we cube both sides of the first equation, we find that $x^3+3x^2y+3xy^2+y^3=729$, so $x^3+y^3=729-(3x^2y+3xy^2)$
Since $3x^2y+3xy^2=3(xy)(x+y)=3(10)(9)$, we see that $x^3+y^3=729-(3x^2y+3xy^2)=729-270=\boxed{459}$.
We use the distance formula to find the length of each side.
The distance from $(0, 1)$ to $(3, 4)$ is $\sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (4 - 1)^2} = 3\sqrt{2}$.
The distance from $(3, 4)$ to $(4, 3)$ is $\sqrt{(4 - 3)^2 + (3 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{2}$.
The distance from $(4, 3)$ to $(3, 0)$ is $\sqrt{(3 - 4)^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{10}$.
The distance from $(3, 0)$ to $(0, 1)$ is $\sqrt{(0 - 3)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{10}$.
Adding all of these side lengths, we find that the perimeter is $4\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{10}$
Thus, our final answer is $4 + 2 = \boxed{6}$.
The area of the room is $(12\text{ ft.}) (6\text{ ft.})=72$ square feet
Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, 1 square yard equals 9 square feet
Therefore, $72/9=\boxed{8}$ square yards are needed to cover the floor.
If the line $x+y=b$ is the perpendicular bisector of the segment from $(0,3)$ to $(6,9)$, it must pass through the midpoint of this segment
The midpoint is: $$\left(\frac{0+6}{2},\frac{3+9}{2}\right)=(3,6)$$This point lies on the line $x+y=b$, so we must have $3+6=b\Rightarrow b=\boxed{9}$.
We begin by expressing both sides of the equation in terms of the base 2: $(2^2)^6=(2^3)^n$, which simplifies to $2^{12}=2^{3n}$
Setting the exponents equal to each other, $12=3n$, or $n=\frac{12}{3}=\boxed{4}$.
We can have $\log_{10}10000=4$ and $\log_{10}100000=5$
Since $\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\log_{10}10000<\log_{10}28471<\log_{10}100000$, meaning $4<\log_{10}28471<5$
Thus, the desired sum is $4+5=\boxed{9}$.
Let $x$ be the positive integer
The problem implies that $(3x)^2 - x = 2010$, or re-arranging, that $9x^2 - x - 2010 = 0$
Suppose this factors as $9x^2 - x - 2010 = (ax+b)(cx+d) = acx^2 + (bc + ad)x + bd$
We can factor $2010 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 67$
If both $a$ and $c$ are divisible by $3$, then $bc + ad$ is also divisible by $3$, which is not the case
Thus, one of $a$ and $c$ is equal to $9$, and the other is equal to $1$; we will choose $a = 9$
Then $b + 9d = -1$ and $bd = 2010$; after a bit of experimentation, we find that $b= 2 \cdot 67, d = 3 \cdot 5$ works
Thus, $$9x^2 - x - 2010 = (9x + 134)(x - 15) = 0,$$ and since $x$ is a positive integer, then $x = \boxed{15}$.
First let's solve $|n-3|<9$
The absolute value of a quantity is less than 9 if and only if the quantity is between $-9$ and 9, so solve \[
\begin{array}{r@{\;\;<\;\;}c@{\;\;<\;\;}lc}
-9 & n-3 & 9 &\quad \implies \\
-9+3 & n & 9+3 &\quad \implies \\
-6 & n & 12.
\end{array}
\] Now consider $|n|<|n-3|$
The distance from $n$ to 0 is $|n|$, and the distance from $n$ to 3 is $|n-3|$
Therefore, this inequality is satisfied by the numbers that are closer to 0 than to 3
These are the numbers less than $1.5$
So the integer solutions of $|n|<|n-3|<9$ are $-5$, $-4$, $-3$, $-2$, $-1$, 0, and 1, and their sum is $-5-4-3-2=\boxed{-14}$.
We have \begin{align*}
(n-1) \cdot n &\cdot (n+1) \cdot (n+2) \cdot (n+3)\\
&= (2-1) \cdot 2 \cdot (2+1) \cdot (2+2) \cdot (2+3) \\
&= 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5,
\end{align*} which is equal to $5!$, or $\boxed{120}$.
We could also multiply the last expression out by hand: \begin{align*}
(1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 &= 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \\
&= 6 \cdot 20 \\
&= 120 .
\end{align*}
We use the distance formula:  $$\sqrt{(7 - 3)^2 + (5 - (-2))^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{16 + 49} = \boxed{\sqrt{65}}.$$
We first find the equations of the lines $l$ and $m.$ Since $l$ passes through $(0,5)$ and $(3,0),$ its slope is $$\frac{0 - 5}{3 - 0} = -\frac{5}{3}.$$Since it passes through $(0,5),$ its $y$-intercept is $(0,5)$ so $l$'s equation is $y = -\frac{5}{3}x + 5.$
Since $m$ passes through $(0,2)$ and $(7,0)$, it has slope $$\frac{0 - 2}{7 - 0} = -\frac{2}{7}.$$Since $m\text{'s}$ $y$-intercept is $(0,2),$ its equation is $y = -\frac{2}{7}x + 2.$
Now we find the $x\text{'s}$ at which $m$ and $l$ reach $y = 15.$ Setting $y = 15$ in both equations, we solve: $$y = 15 = -\frac{5}{3}x + 5.$$Subtracting $5$ and multiplying by $-\frac{3}{5}$ for both sides, we get $x = -6.$ Thus, $l$ reaches $y = 15$ when $x = -6.$ Now we solve $$y = 15 = -\frac{2}{7}x + 2.$$Subtracting $2$ and multiplying by $-\frac{7}{2}$ for both sides, we get $x = -45.5.$ Thus, $m$ reaches $y = 15$ when $x = -45.5.$
Thus, $(-6) - (-45.5) = \boxed{39.5},$ which is our answer.
The first equality implies that $ab+c-bc-a = b(a-c)-(a-c) = 0 \Rightarrow (b-1)(a-c) = 0$
By symmetry, we have: \begin{align*}
(b-1)(a-c) &= 0 \\
(c-1)(b-a) &= 0 \\
(a-1)(c-b) &= 0
\end{align*} By inspection, at least one of the following is true: $a=b$, $b=c$, or $c=a$
Without loss of generality, assume $a=b$
Substituting this into the first of our original equations, we obtain $a^2+c = ac+a \Rightarrow a^2+c = a(c+1)=41$
Since $41$ is prime and $a$ and $c$ are positive integers, either $a=1$ or $a=41$
Note that if $a=41$, then $c+1 = 1 \Rightarrow c=0$, a contradiction with the fact that $c$ is positive
Thus, $a=b=1 \Rightarrow c+1=41 \Rightarrow c=40$
Therefore $a+b+c = \boxed{42}$
Since $\left(\frac{1}{4}, -6\right)$ lies on the line, we plug $x = \frac{1}{4}$ and $y = -6$ into the equation to get  \begin{align*}
-\frac{1}{2} - \frac{k}{2} &= 5(-6)\\
\Rightarrow\qquad -1-k = -60\\
\Rightarrow\qquad k=\boxed{59}.
\end{align*}
We see that $(x + y)^2 = (x^2 + y^2) + 2xy = 1$
We want to find $x^2 + y^2$ and are given $xy = -4$
So, $x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = x^2 + y^2 + 2(-4) = 1$
It follows that $x^2 + y^2 = \boxed 9$.
The discriminant of the quadratic polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c $ is given by $b^2 - 4ac$
Substituting, the answer is $\left(3 + \frac 13\right)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot \frac 13 = 3^2 + 2 + \frac 1{3^2} - 4 = 3^2 - 2 + \frac 1{3^2} = \left(3 - \frac 13\right)^2 = \boxed{\frac{64}{9}}$.
$\frac{1}{10}$ of $60$ boys is $60/10=6$ students, while $\frac{1}{3}$ of $45$ girls is $45/3=15$ students, so $21$ students were absent that day
Since we know that $\frac{21}{105}=\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{1}{5}$ is equal to $20\%$, we know that $\boxed{20 \%}$ of the total student population was absent.
The series has first term $\frac{1}{3}$ and common ratio $\frac{1}{2}$, so the formula yields: $\cfrac{\frac{1}{3}}{1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}=\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
For the compounded interest, we use the formula $A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the end balance, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the number of years, and $n$ is the number of times compounded in a year.
First we find out how much he would owe in $5$ years, which is $$\$10,\!000\left(1+\frac{0.1}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5} \approx \$16,\!386.16$$
He pays off half of it in $5$ years, which is $\frac{\$16,\!386.16}{2}=\$8193.08$ He has $\$8193.08$ left to be compounded over the next $5$ years
This then becomes $$\$8193.08\left(1+\frac{0.1}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5} \approx \$13,\!425.32$$
He has to pay back a total of $\$8193.08+\$13,\!425.32=\$21,\!618.40$ in ten years if he chooses the compounding interest.
For the simple interest, he would have to pay $0.12 \cdot 10000=1200$ dollars per year
This means he would have to pay a total of $10000+10 \cdot 1200=22000$ dollars in ten years.
Therefore, he should choose the compounded interest and save $\$22000-\$21618.40=\$381.6 \approx \boxed{382 \text{ dollars}}$.
We see that $39^2 = (40 - 1)^2 = 40^2 - 2\cdot 40 \cdot 1 +1 = 40^2 - 79$
Therefore, David subtracts $\boxed{79}$.
The area of the frame is equal to  \begin{align*}
(2x + 3) \cdot (y+2) - x \cdot y &= 2xy + 4x + 3y + 6 - xy \\
&= xy + 4x + 3y + 6 \\
&= 34.
\end{align*}To apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we add $6$ to both sides of the equation: $$xy + 4x + 3y + 12 = 40,$$so $$(x + 3)(y+4) = 40.$$Considering the factor pairs of 40, we see that the ordered pair $(x+3, y+4)$ must be among $$(1,40),(2,20),(4,10),(5,8),(8,5),(10,4),(20,2),(40,1).$$Solving for $x$ and $y$ for each pair of factors, we find that $(x,y)$ must be among the pairs $$(-2,36), (-1,16), (1,6), (2,4), (5,1), (7,0), (17,-2), (37,-3).$$Of these, only $(x,y) = (2,4)$ satisfy the condition that both $x$ and $y$ are greater than $1$
The area of the picture is thus $x \times y = \boxed{8}$ square inches.
Writing $13.5$ as $\frac{27}{2}$, we get \[\sqrt[3]{4\div 13.5} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4}{27/2}} = \sqrt[3]{4\cdot \frac{2}{27}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{8}{27}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{2^3}{3^3}} = \boxed{\frac23}.\]
From $A$ to $B$, the $x$-coordinate increases by $12$ and the $y$-coordinate increases by $6$
If we continue on for $\frac{1}{3}$ of this distance, we will add $\frac{1}{3}12=4$ to the $x$-coordinate and $\frac{1}{3}6=2$ to the $y$-coordinate, to get $C=(14+4,4+2)=\boxed{(18,6)}$.
First, we recognize that $\frac{4}{3x^{-3}}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{4x^3}{3}$
Thus, we have  \begin{align*}
\frac{4}{3x^{-3}} \cdot \frac{3x^{2}}{2} & = \frac{4x^3}{3} \cdot \frac{3x^2}{2} \\
& = \frac{(4 \cdot 3)(x^3 \cdot x^2)}{3 \cdot 2} \\
& = 2x^{3+2} \\
& = \boxed{2x^5}.
\end{align*}
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer
We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)
Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.
Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer
Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.
Now, suppose $n$ is even
For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.
More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1
Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2
We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on
Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.
Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64.
We have $\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^{-1}=8=2^3$, so we can write the given equation as $$(m-4)^3=2^3.$$ Therefore, $m-4 = 2$, so $m=\boxed{6}$.
This is a geometric sequence with a first term of $3$ and a common ratio of $2$
At the end of the eighth day, we are at the 5th term of this sequence, so there are $3\cdot2^4=\boxed{48}$ cells then.
The sum is equal to \[\frac{1 + 2 + \dots + 10}{5}.\] For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so \[\frac{1 + 2 + \dots + 10}{5} = \frac{10 \cdot 11/2}{5} = \boxed{11}.\]
First we can factor out an $x$
That gives us the equation $x(4x^2 + 5x - 8) = 0$
This product is equal to zero when $x = 0$ or when $(4x^2 + 5x - 8) = 0$
This root of zero contributes nothing to the sum of the roots
Now we don't actually need to factor $4x^2 + 5x - 8 = 0$ into the product of two binomials to find the sum of the roots
(It doesn't factor nicely.) If we divide both sides of this equation by 4, we get $x^2
+ (5/4)x - 2 = 0$
The coefficient of the middle term (5/4) is the opposite of the sum of the roots, so our answer is $\boxed{-1.25}$.
Setting $y$ to zero, we get the quadratic
\[-4.9t^2 + 3.5t + 5 = 0.\]Multiplying both sides by $-10,$ we get
\[49t^2 - 35t - 50 = 0.\]This quadratic factors as $(7t - 10)(7t + 5) = 0.$  As $t$ must be positive, we can see that $t = \boxed{\frac{10}{7}}.$
The equation, $8^n\cdot8^n\cdot8^n=64^3$, can be written as $8^{3n}=64^3$
We also know that $64=8^2$, so we can rewrite the equation as $8^{3n}=8^{2(3)}$
Solving for $n$ gives $n=\boxed{2}$.
We want the smaller numbers to be in the tens places, so 6 and 7 go on the left and 8 and 9 go on the right
We now have two possibilities: $68\times79=5372$ and $69\times78=5382$
The smaller of these is $\boxed{5372}$, our answer.
The area of the large rectangle is $(x+7)(x+5)$, and the area of the hole is $(2x-3)(x-2)$
To get our answer, we subtract the area of the hole from the area of the large rectangle
\begin{align*}
(x&+7)(x+5)-(2x-3)(x-2)\\
&=x(x+5)+7(x+5)-2x(x-2)+3(x-2)\\
&=x^2+5x+7x+35-2x^2+4x+3x-6\\
&=\boxed{-x^2+19x+29}.
\end{align*}
First, we factor the denominators, to get \[\frac{G}{x + 5} + \frac{H}{x(x - 4)} = \frac{x^2 - 2x + 10}{x(x + 5)(x - 4)}.\]We then multiply both sides by $x(x + 5)(x - 4)$, to get \[Gx(x - 4) + H(x + 5) = x^2 - 2x + 10.\]We can solve for $G$ and $H$ by substituting suitable values of $x$
For example, setting $x = -5$, we get $45G = 45$, so $G = 1$
Setting $x = 0$, we get $5H = 10$, so $H = 2$
(This may not seem legitimate, because we are told that the given equation holds for all $x$ except $-5$, 0, and 4
This tells us that the equation $Gx(x - 4) + H(x + 5) = x^2 - 2x + 10$ holds for all $x$, except possibly $-5$, 0, and 4
However, both sides of this equation are polynomials, and if two polynomials are equal for an infinite number of values of $x$, then the two polynomials are equal for all values of $x$
Hence, we can substitute any value we wish to into this equation.)
Therefore, $H/G = 2/1 = \boxed{2}$.
Let Ted's age be $t$ and Sally's age be $s$
We are trying to find the value of $t$
We can write a system of two equations to represent the given information
Here are our two equations:
\begin{align*}
t &= 2s - 15 \\
t + s &= 54 \\
\end{align*}The first equation represents the statement ``Ted's age is 15 years less than twice Sally's age.'' The second equation represents the statement ``The sum of their ages is 54.'' We are solving for $t$, so we want to eliminate $s$
From the second equation, we get that $s=54-t$
Substituting that into the first equation to get rid of $s$, we have $t=2(54-t)-15$, from which we get that $t=31$
Thus, Ted's age is $\boxed{31}$ years old.
Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of $x^2+px+m=0.$ Since the roots of $x^2+mx+n=0$ are $2r_1$ and $2r_2,$ we have the following relationships: \[
m=r_1 r_2,\quad n=4r_1 r_2,\quad p=-(r_1+r_2), \quad\text{and}\quad
m=-2(r_1+r_2).
\] So \[
n = 4m, \quad p = \frac{1}{2}m,
\quad\text{and}\quad
\frac{n}{p}=\frac{4m}{\frac{1}{2}m}=\boxed{8}.
Alternatively, the roots of \[
\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 + p\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + m = 0
\] are twice those of $x^2 + px + m = 0.$ Since the first equation is equivalent to $x^2 + 2px + 4m = 0,$ we have \[
m = 2p \quad\text{and}\quad n = 4m, \quad\text{so}\quad \frac{n}{p} = \boxed{8}.\]
Since $6^4=6\cdot6\cdot6\cdot6=36\cdot6\cdot6=216\cdot6=1296$, and $10^4=10000$, we have $60^4=6^4\cdot10^4=12960000$ and $$\sqrt[4]{12960000}=\boxed{60}.$$
This is an infinite geometric series with first term $1$ and common ratio $1/5$
Thus, the sum is $\frac{1}{1-\frac15} = \boxed{\frac{5}{4}}$.
We expand the left side to get $(abx^2+(a^2+b^2)x+ab)=26x^2+\Box\cdot x+26$
The coefficients of like terms must be equal, so that means $ab=26$
The only possibilities for $(a,b)$ are $(2,13)$, $(-2,-13)$, $(13,2)$, $(-13,-2)$, $(1,26)$, $(26,1)$, $(-1,-26)$, or $(-26,-1)$
Since we're looking for $\Box=a^2+b^2$, we just compute $1^2+26^2 = 677$ and $2^2+13^2=173$, the minimum of which is $\boxed{173}$.
Since $\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $\beta$, by definition $\alpha\beta = k$ for some constant $k$
Plugging in, we see that $(-3)\cdot (-6) = k$, so $k = 18$
So when $\beta = 8$, we have that $8\alpha = 18$, or $\alpha = \boxed{\frac{9}{4}}$.
We have that $ax^2 + bx + c = 2(x - 4)^2 + 8$
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get \[3ax^2 + 3bx + 3c = 6(x - 4)^2 + 24.\]The value of $h$, namely $\boxed{4}$, remains exactly the same.
The cost of renting for four days is $25\times4=100$ and the cost of driving $400$ miles is $.20\times400=\frac{400}{5}=80$
He has to pay $100+80=\boxed{\$180}$.
Let $x$ be the number of blue marbles and $y$ the number of yellow marbles before I added more
We are given that the ratio of blue to yellow is 8:5, so $\dfrac{x}{y}=\dfrac{8}{5}$
Additionally, after we remove blue marbles and add yellow marbles the total number of blue marbles and yellow marbles will be $x-12$ and $y+21$ respectively
We're given that at this point the ratio will be $1:3$, so $\dfrac{x-12}{y+21}=\dfrac{1}{3}$
Cross multiplying the first equation gives $5x=8y$ and cross multiplying the second gives $3(x-12)=1(y+21)$
Solving two linear equations on two variables is routine; we get the solution $y=15$, $x=24$
Since $x$ represents the number of blue marbles before some were removed, the answer to the problem is just $\boxed{24}$.
Because the quadratic has two distinct integer roots, we know that it can be factored as  \[(x+r)(x+s),\] where $r$ and $s$ are positive integers
Expanding this product gives  $x^2 + (r+s)x + rs$, and comparing this to the given quadratic tells us that $rs = 36$
So, we consider all the pairs of distinct integers that multiply to 36, and we compute their sum in each case: \[\begin{array}{cc|c}
r&s&r+s\\\hline
1&36&37\\
2&18&20\\
3&12&15\\
4&9&13\end{array}\] Summing the entries in the final column gives us a total of $\boxed{85}$.
The largest common factor of $9x^2$ and $3x$ is $3x$
We factor $3x$ out of each term to get\begin{align*}
9x^2+3x &= 3x\cdot 3x + 3x \cdot 1\\
&= \boxed{3x(3x+1)}.
\end{align*}
Solving $2y + x + 3 = 0$ for $y$ gives $ y = \frac{-1}{2}x - \frac{3}{2},$ so the slope of this line is $-\frac{1}{2}.$
Solving $3y + ax + 2 = 0$ for $y$ gives $ y = \frac{-a}{3}x - \frac{2}{3},$ so the slope of this line is $- \frac{a}{3}.$
In order for these lines to be perpendicular, we must have $$\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{a}{3}\right) = -1.$$Solving for $a$ gives $a = \boxed{-6}.$
The geometric series involving the odd powers of $r$ is $ar+ar^3+ar^5+\cdots = 5.$ Note that if we subtract this from the original series, the series involving the even powers of $r$ is  \[12-5=7= a+ar^2+ar^4+\cdots =\frac{1}{r}(ar+ar^3+ar^5+\cdots).\]However, the series involving even powers of $r$ is just $\frac{1}{r}$ times the series involving odd powers of $r,$ as shown above
Thus, substituting in our values for both those series, $7=\frac{1}{r}(5) \implies r=\boxed{\frac{5}{7}}.$
To find the intersection, we must find the point satisfying both equations
Hence we must solve the system \begin{align*}
2y&=-x+3, \\
-y&=5x+1.
\end{align*}Adding two times the second equation to the first, we get $2y+2(-y)=-x+3+2(5x+1)$, which simplifies to $0=9x+5$
Solving for $x$, we find that $x=-\frac{5}{9}$
Plugging this into the second equation above, we obtain $-y=5\cdot -\frac{5}{9}+1=-\frac{16}{9}$
So the intersection is $\boxed{\left(-\frac{5}{9}, \frac{16}{9}\right)}$.
It follows that the common ratio of the geometric sequence is equal to $\frac 53$
Thus, $D = \frac 53 \cdot C = \frac 53 \cdot \frac 53 \cdot B = \frac{25B}{9}$
Since $D$ is an integer, it follows that $B$ must be divisible by $9$
The lowest possible value of $B$ is $B = 9$, which yields a value of $C = 15$ and $D = 25$
The common difference between the first three terms is thus $15 - 9 = 6$, so it follows that $A = B - 6 = 3$
The sum $A+B+C+D = 3+9+15+25 = \boxed{52}$.
If $B = 9k$ for $k > 1$, then $C = \frac 53 \cdot B = 15k$ and $D = \frac 53 \cdot C = 25k$
Then, $A+B+C+D > B+C+D \ge 49k \ge 98$, so it follows that $52$ is indeed the smallest possible value of $A+B+C+D$.
At the end of distributing the coins, Paul has $x$ coins, and Pete has four times as many, or $4x$ coins
We can also write the number of coins Pete has as $1+2+3+ \dots +x = x(x + 1)/2$
Therefore, \[\frac{x(x + 1)}{2} = 4x.\] Solving for $x$, we find $x = 7$, so the total number of coins they have is $x+4x=5x=5(7)=\boxed{35}$.
First we find Jill's speed in miles per hour by dividing total distance by time, in which we can cancel a common factor: \begin{align*}
\text{Jill's speed}&=\frac{x^2-3x-54}{x+6}\quad\Rightarrow\\
&=\frac{(x-9)(x+6)}{x+6}\quad\Rightarrow\\
&=(x-9).
\end{align*}Now we set the two speeds equal to each other and solve for $x$: \begin{align*}
x-9&=x^2-11x-22\quad\Rightarrow\\
0&=x^2-12x-13\quad\Rightarrow\\
0&=(x+1)(x-13).
\end{align*}If $x=-1$, we'd get a speed of $-1-9=-10$ miles per hour, which isn't possible
That means $x=13$, so their speed was $13-9=\boxed{4}$ miles per hour.
Writing the equation in exponential form gives us $2x-7 = 9^{\frac{3}{2}} = (9^{\frac{1}{2}})^3 = 3^3 = 27$
Solving $2x-7=27$ gives us $x = \boxed{17}$
We look for a binomial $ax+b$ whose square agrees with $49x^2+56x-64$, except possibly at the constant term
First we note that $a$ must be $7$ or $-7$, since the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(ax+b)^2$ is $a^2$, and we need this to equal $49$
Since we are given that $a>0$, we reject $-7$ and select $a=7$.
Now we want $49x^2+56x-64$ to have the same coefficient of $x$ as $(7x+b)^2$
Since the coefficient of $x$ in $(7x+b)^2$ is $14b$, we solve $56 = 14b$ to obtain $b=4$
Therefore, $49x^2+56x-64$ agrees with $(7x+4)^2$, except that the constant term is different
Specifically, $(7x+4)^2 = 49x^2+56x+16$.
Now we can rewrite Po's original equation as follows: \begin{align*}
49x^2+56x-64 &= 0\\
49x^2+56x+16 &= 80\\
(7x+4)^2 &= 80.
\end{align*}This gives $a + b + c = 7 + 4 + 80 = \boxed{91}.$
The vertex of the parabola is $(3,2)$, so the equation of the parabola is of the form \[x = a(y - 2)^2 + 3.\] The parabola passes through the point $(1,4)$
Substituting these values into the equation above, we get \[1 = a(4 - 2)^2 + 3.\] Solving for $a$, we find $a = -1/2$
Hence, the equation of the parabola is given by \[x = -\frac{1}{2} (y - 2)^2 + 3 = -\frac{1}{2} (y^2 - 4y + 4) + 3 = -\frac{1}{2} y^2 + 2y + 1.\] The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
Alternatively, the value of $x = ay^2 + by + c$ is $c$ when $y = 0$
The parabola passes through the point $(1,0)$, so $c = \boxed{1}$.
Lisa wants to minimize the number of marbles she gives to her friends without giving any two of them the same number of marbles
The minimum number of marbles she can give to a friend is 1
She then gives 2 marbles to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 10
The total number of marbles Lisa has given away is $1+2+3+\cdots+10 = \frac{10 \cdot 11}{2}=55$.
Thus, Lisa needs $55-34=\boxed{21}$ more marbles.
Let $s$ be the number of stools in the room and $t$ be the number of tables
We are looking for the value of $t$
We can set up a system of equations to represent the given information, as follows:
\begin{align*}
s &= 6t \\
3s + 4t &= 484 \\
\end{align*}To solve for $t$, we need to eliminate $s$ from the equations above
Substitute the first equation into the second to eliminate $s$, to get $3(6t)+4t=484$, or $t=22$
Thus, there are $\boxed{22}$ tables in the room.
Note that $\sqrt[3]{x-3}$ is defined for all $x$
The only restriction is due to the $\sqrt{x-2}$ term, which is defined only if $x-2$ is nonnegative
Thus, the domain of $w(x)$ is $\boxed{[2,\infty)}$.
Let $c$ equal the cost of a bouquet of 39 roses (in dollars)
Since we know that the price of a bouquet is directly proportional to the number of roses it contains, we can set up the following proportion \begin{align*} \frac{c}{39}&=\frac{20}{12}
\\\Rightarrow \qquad c&=\left(\frac{20}{12}\right)(39)
\\\Rightarrow \qquad c&=\boxed{65}
\end{align*}
Call the second term $a$, and the difference between any two consecutive terms $x$
So, the third term is $a+x$, and the fourth term is $a+2x$
Adding the second and fourth terms gives $2a+2x$, which is simply twice the third term
So the third term is $\frac{6}{2} = \boxed{3}$.
Simplifying, we have: \begin{align*}
2a(2a^2 + a) - a^2 &= 2a(2a^2) + 2a(a) - a^2 \\
&= 4a^3 + 2a^2 - a^2 = \boxed{4a^3 + a^2}.
\end{align*}
Since $46=2\cdot23$ and $115=5\cdot23$, we can factor a $23x^3$ from the expression, to get \[46x^3-115x^7=23x^3(2-5x^4)=\boxed{-23x^3(5x^4-2)},\] which is our answer.
First we begin by solving the system of equations \begin{align*}
5a+2b&=0, \\
b-2&=a.
\end{align*}Making the substitution for $a$ from the second equation to the first, we get $5(b-2)+2b=0$, which simplifies to $7b-10=0$
Solving for $b$, we find that $b=\frac{10}{7}$
Hence $7b=7\cdot \frac{10}{7}=\boxed{10}$.
Let's call the length of the rectangle $l$, and the width $w$
In general, the perimeter of a rectangle can be expressed as the sum of all four sides
Thus, it is equal to $2l+2w$
Similarly, we can express the area of the rectangle as $lw$
Since we know that Wendy uses all the fencing, the perimeter of the rectangle she encloses must be 180 feet
The area, which is 10 times that, comes out to 1800 feet
This gives us a system of two equations:  \begin{align*} 2l+2w& =180
\\lw& =1800
\end{align*}If we solve for $l$ in terms of $w$ using the first equation, we find that $180-2w=2l$, or $l=90-w$
We can plug this expression back into the the second equation, giving us  \begin{align*} (90-w)(w)& =1800
\\ 90w-w^2& =1800
\\ \Rightarrow\qquad w^2-90w+1800& =0
\\ \Rightarrow\qquad (w-60)(w-30)& =0 \end{align*}Thus, the two possible values of $w$ are 60 feet and 30 feet
Since $l=90-w$, the possible values of $l$ must be 30 feet or 60 feet (respectively)
Since the problem asks for the largest side, the answer is ultimately $\boxed{60}$.
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$
We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$
So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$
It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$.
We need $-10x^2-11x+6\geq 0$
The quadratic factors as $$(2x+3)(-5x+2) \ge 0.$$ Thus the zeroes of the quadratic are at $-\frac{3}{2}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$
Since the quadratic opens downward, it is nonnegative between the zeroes
So the domain is $x \in \boxed{\left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right]}$.
We use the given information to set up a quadratic that relates the area of the field to $m$: \begin{align*}
(2m+7)(m-2)&=51\\
2m^2+3m-14 &= 51\\
2m^2+3m-65 &= 0\\
(2m+13)(m-5)&=0
\end{align*}The two possible solutions are $m=-\frac{13}{2}$ and $m=5$
Of these, only $m = \boxed{5}$ is valid.
The perpendicular bisector of $AB$ must meet $AB$ at its midpoint, so $C$ is the midpoint of $AB$
We use the midpoint formula to find that $C = \left(\frac{24 + 3}{2}, \frac{7 + 4}{2} \right) = \left(\frac{27}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right).$ Therefore, $2x - 4y = 27 - 22 = \boxed{5}.$
If the number is $x$, we set up the equation $\frac{25}{100}x=\frac{20}{100}(30)$, which means $\frac14x=\frac15(30)=6$
So $x=6\cdot4=24$
The number is $\boxed{24}$.
We can make our work easier by rewriting all fractions in the inequality so that they have a common denominator of $48$: $$\frac{10}{48} + \left|x-\frac{11}{48}\right| < \frac{15}{48}$$Then we subtract $\frac{10}{48}$ from both sides: $$\left|x-\frac{11}{48}\right| < \frac{5}{48}$$The expression on the left side is the positive difference between $x$ and $\frac{11}{48}$
So, the inequality says that $x$ is strictly between $\frac{11}{48}-\frac{5}{48}$ and $\frac{11}{48}+\frac{5}{48}$
Simplifying these expressions and writing our answer in interval notation, we have $x\in\boxed{\left(\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{3}\right)}$.
The quadratic factors as $(2x + 3)(x - 4 + x - 6) = (2x + 3)(2x - 10) = 2(2x + 3)(x - 5).$  Thus, the roots are $-\frac{3}{2}$ and 5, and their sum is $\boxed{\frac{7}{2}}.$
Write $ab+bc+cd+da = (a+c)b + (c+a)d = (a+c)(b+d)$, so $a+c = \frac{ab+bc+cd+da}{b+d} = \frac{30}{5} = \boxed{6}$.
We will complete the square for $y^2 + 10y + 33.$
The binomial to be squared will be of the form $y+a$ because the coefficient of $y^2$ is 1
By squaring the binomial, we get $y^2+2ay+a^2$
We want $2ay$ to be equal to $10y$, therefore $a=5$
$(y+5)^2=y^2+10y+25$.
$y^2+10y+33=(y^2+10y+25)+8=(y+5)^2+8$
Therefore, the binomial is $y+5$ and the integer is $\boxed{8}$.
In $3\frac{1}{2}$ hours, Joann covers $\left(3\frac{1}{2}\text{ hours}\right)(12\text{ mph})=42$ miles
If Fran's average speed in miles per hour is $s$, then Fran covers $3s$ miles in $3$ hours
Solving $3s=42$ we find $s=\boxed{14}$ miles per hour.
First, we multiply a degree-$1$ term and a degree-$2$ term, so we have a degree-$3$ polynomial
We subtract a constant times a degree-$3$ polynomial, so we can have at most a degree-$3$ polynomial, so at most $4$ terms
However, we are unsure if any of the terms will subtract to zero, so we must multiply out the polynomials:  \begin{align*}
&(x+4)(2x^2+3x+9)-3(x^3-2x^2+7x)\\
&\qquad=x(2x^2+3x+9)+4(2x^2+3x+9)-(3x^3-6x^2+21x)\\
&\qquad=2x^3+3x^2+9x+8x^2+12x+36-(3x^3-6x^2+21x)\\
&\qquad=2x^3+11x^2+21x+36-(3x^3-6x^2+21x)\\
&\qquad=2x^3-3x^3+11x^2+6x^2+21x-21x+36\\
&\qquad=-x^3+17x^2+36.
\end{align*}As we can see, the linear term drops out, and we are left with $\boxed{3}$ terms.
$$\begin{array}{crrrrrrr}

We have  \begin{align*}
(a^b)^a - (b^a)^b &= (2^3)^2 - (3^2)^3\\
&=8^2 - 9^3\\
&=64-729\\
&=\boxed{-665}.
\end{align*}
The given equations are equivalent, respectively, to \[
3^a=3^{4(b+2)}\quad\text{and}\quad 5^{3b}=5^{a-3}.
\] Therefore $a=4(b+2)$ and $3b=a-3$
The solution of this system is $a=-12$ and $b=-5$, so $ab=\boxed{60}$.
A point lies above $y=2x+7$ if its $y$-coordinate is greater than 2 times its $x$-coordinate plus 7
Checking the given points, we find that $(6,20)$, $(12,35)$, and $(20,50)$ satisfy this condition
The sum of the $x$-coordinates of these points is $6+12+20=\boxed{38}$.
If $x$ is the number, then moving the decimal point four places to the right is the same as multiplying $x$ by $10{,}000$
That is, $10{,}000x = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$, which is equivalent to $x^2 = 4/10{,}000$
Since $x$ is positive, it follows that $x = 2/100 = \boxed{0.02}$.
If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\cdot 12\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight
If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\cdot15\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight
Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$: \begin{align*}
30n&=480\\
\Rightarrow\qquad n&=480/30=\boxed{16}
\end{align*}
Expanding the first given equation using the distributive property, we have \begin{align*}
&18=(x+y+z)(xy+xz+yz)\\
&=x\cdot(xy+xz+yz)+y\cdot(xy+xz+yz)+z\cdot(xy+xz+yz)\\
&=x^2y+x^2z+xyz+xy^2+xyz+y^2z+xyz+xz^2+yz^2\\
&=3xyz+x^2y+x^2z+xy^2+y^2z+xz^2+yz^2
\end{align*}Expanding the second given equation using the distributive property, we have \begin{align*}
6&=x^2(y+z)+y^2(x+z)+z^2(x+y)\\
&=x^2y+x^2z+xy^2+y^2z+xz^2+yz^2.\end{align*}We substitute the equation $$6=x^2y+x^2z+xy^2+y^2z+xz^2+yz^2$$into the expanded form of the first given equation to get \[18=3xyz+6\]or $xyz=\boxed{4}$.
First, we simplify the left side, and we have \[2^x+2^x+2^x+2^x = 4\cdot 2^x = 2^2\cdot 2^x = 2^{x+2}.\]Noting that $128 = 2^7$, our equation now is $2^{x+2} = 2^7$, so $x+2 = 7$
Therefore, $x=5$, and $(x+1)(x-1) = (6)(4) = \boxed{24}$.
Let the price of a pen be $x$ and the price of a pencil be $y$, in cents
We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given: \begin{align*}
4x + 3y &= 224, \\
2x + 5y &= 154
\end{align*}We can subtract the first equation from twice the second equation to obtain $7y = 84$, so $y = 12$
Therefore, the cost of a pencil is $\boxed{12}$ cents.
Multiply both sides of the first equation by $y$ and both sides of the second equation by $z$ to obtain \begin{align*}
xy+1 &= y \\
yz+1 &= z.
\end{align*} Substituting $xy+1$ for $y$ in the second equation, we find \[
(xy+1)z+1=z,
\] which simplifies to \[
xyz+z+1=z.
\] Subtracting $z+1$ from both sides, we find that $xyz=z-(z+1)=\boxed{-1}.$
$252^2-248^2$ can also be expressed as $(252+248)(252-248)$
Simpifying, we obtain $500\cdot4 = \boxed{2000}$.
We look at the coefficient of $x$ in the expansion of the product on the left
We get an $x$ term when we multiply $(+7)(+tx)$ and when we multiply $(-6x)(+10)$ in the expansion
So, on the left the $x$ term is $7tx -60x$
Since this term must equal $-102x$, we have $7tx -60x = -102x$, so $t = \boxed{-6}$.
We can check our answer (and check that it is indeed possible to find a solution to this problem) by multiplying out the left when $t=-6$: \begin{align*} &(5x^2-6x+7)(4x^2-6x+10)\\
&\qquad= 5x^2(4x^2-6x+10) -6x(4x^2-6x+10) \\
&\qquad\qquad+ 7(4x^2-6x+10)\\ &\qquad=20x^4 -54x^3 +114x^2 -102x +70
\end{align*}This matches the polynomial given in the problem, so our answer is correct.
Setting $y$ to zero, we find the following:
\begin{align*}
-6t^2 - 10t + 56 &= 0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad 6t^2 + 10t - 56 &= 0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad 3t^2 + 5t - 28 &= 0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad (3t-7)(t+4) &= 0.
\end{align*}As $t$ must be positive, we can see that $t = \frac{7}{3} \approx \boxed{2.33}.$
Two lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal
The slope of a line whose equation is $y = mx + b$ is $m$
Thus $8 = 2c \Rightarrow c = \boxed{4}$.
One can find this by multiplying the two polynomials and computing the coefficients
Alternatively, we notice that the desired expression is simply the value of $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ evaluated at the point $x=2$: $a(2)^3 + b(2)^2 + c(2) + d = 8a + 4b + 2c + d$
Since $(3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)$ and  $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ are equivalent expressions, they are equal for all real values of $x$
In particular, they are equal when $x=2$
So $8a+4b+2c+d=(3 \cdot (2)^2 - 5 \cdot (2) + 4)(7 - 2 \cdot (2)) = 6 \cdot 3 = \boxed{18}.$
We know that $x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)$
Substituting, we see that $x^2 - y^2 = \frac{7}{13}\cdot\frac{1}{91} = \boxed{\frac{1}{169}}$.
We can rearrange the equation as $x^2 + 4x = 0$
Factoring gives $x(x+4)=0$, which has solutions $x=0$ and $x=-4$
Only $\boxed{1}$ of these solutions is nonnegative.
Let the other endpoint be $(x, y)$
We know that $\frac{4 + x}{2} + \frac{3 + y}{2} = 2 + 9 = 11$
Thus, $7 + x + y = 22$, and $x + y = \boxed{15}$.
Writing the equation $\log_{81} (2r-1) = -1/2$ in exponential notation gives $2r-1 = 81^{-1/2} = (9^2)^{-1/2} = 9^{-1} = 1/9$
Solving $2r-1 = 1/9$ gives $r = \boxed{\frac{5}{9}}$.
The numerator factors as $(1622-1615)(1622+1615)=7(3237)$.
The denominator factors as $(1629-1608)(1629+1608)=21(3237)$.
Thus the fraction is equal to
$$\frac{7(3237)}{21(3237)}=\frac{7}{21}=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$$
If $4x^2 + 14x + a$  is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $2x +b$ for some number $b$, because $(2x)^2 = 4x^2$
So, we compare $(2x+b)^2$ to $4x^2 + 14x + a$
Expanding $(2x+b)^2$ gives \[(2x+b)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)(b) + b^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.\] Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $4x^2+14x+a$, we have $4bx=14x$, so $b=\frac{14}{4}=\frac{7}{2}$
Squaring the binomial gives $\left(2x+\frac{7}{2}\right)^2=4x^2+14x+\frac{49}{4}$
Therefore, $a=\boxed{\frac{49}{4}}$.
The number $\pi$ is between $3.14$ and $3.15$, so $-8\pi$ is between $-8(3.15) = 25.2$ and $-8(3.14) = 25.12$
Likewise, $10\pi$ is between $31.4$ and $31.5$
This suffices to establish that the integers $n$ between $-8\pi$ and $10\pi$ are precisely $$-25, -24, -23, -22, \ldots, 28, 29, 30, 31.$$ There are $25$ negative integers in this list, $31$ positive integers, and one more integer ($0$), making $\boxed{57}$ integers in total.
The cube root of 1000 is 10; the cube root of any number smaller than 1000 is less than 10
So, the whole numbers from 1 to 999 are the only positive whole numbers with cube roots less than 10
There are $\boxed{999}$ such numbers.
We find the average words per hour by dividing the total words by the total hours
$$\frac{40,\!000\text{ words}}{80\text{ hours}}=\frac{4,\!000}{8}=\frac{40\cdot100}{8}=5\cdot100=\boxed{500} \text{ words per hour}$$
First we try factoring the left side to simplify it: $$\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=\frac{4(x-3)}{(x-3)(x+5)}=\frac{4}{x+5}.$$Now we can multiply both sides by $(x+5)$ and solve for $x$: \begin{align*}
\frac{4}{x+5}&=x+2\quad\Rightarrow\\
4&=(x+5)(x+2)\quad\Rightarrow\\
&=x^2+7x+10\quad\Rightarrow\\
0&=x^2+7x+6\quad\Rightarrow\\
&=(x+6)(x+1).
\end{align*}So $p=-1$ and $q=-6$, making $p-q=\boxed{5}$.
If $x^2+100x+c$ is the square of a binomial, then because the coefficient of $x^2$ is $1$, the binomial must be of the form $x+a$ for some $a$.
Expanding, we have $(x+a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$
For this to be equal to $x^2+100x+c$, the coefficients of $x$ must agree, so $2a$ must be equal to $100$
This gives $a=50$, and so the constant term $a^2$ is $\boxed{2500}$.
Joe has 2 ounces  of cream in his cup
JoAnn has drunk 2 ounces  of the 14 ounces  of coffee-cream mixture in her cup, so she has only $12/14 = 6/7$ of her 2 ounces  of cream in her cup
Therefore the ratio of the amount of cream in Joe's coffee to that in JoAnn's coffee is \[
\frac{2}{\frac{6}{7}\cdot2} = \boxed{\frac{7}{6}}.
Simplifying, we have $x^2+30x+216=0$
Factoring, we get $(x + 12)(x + 18) = 0$
Hence, the roots are $-12$ and $-18$ and the nonnegative difference between them is $(-12) - (-18) = \boxed{6}.$
Writing everything in terms of prime factorizations, the given expression is  \begin{align*}
\sqrt{2 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot p^7} &= \sqrt{(2^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot p^6) \cdot (3 \cdot p)} \\
&= \boxed{10p^3 \sqrt{3p}}.
\end{align*}
The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\frac{16}{12} = \frac{4}{3}$
Thus, the $n^{\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence
Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2 = 12$
Solving, we have $a\left(\frac{16}{9}\right) = 12 \Rightarrow a = 12\left(\frac{9}{16}\right) = \boxed{\frac{27}{4}}$.
The common difference of this arithmetic sequence is $6-2=4$
Since every two consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence differ by this value, $y=26-4=22$ and $x=26-2 \cdot 4 = 18$
Hence, $x+y=22+18=\boxed{40}$.
Putting the equation in exponential form, we have $b^{-\frac{3}{2}}=343$
Take the cube root of both sides (since $343=7^3$) to find $b^{-\frac{1}{2}}=7$
Square both sides, to find $b^{-1}=7^2=49$
Thus $\frac{1}{b}=49$ and $\boxed{b=\frac{1}{49}}$.
By inspection, upon expanding the terms of the product $(x^4 - 3x + 2)(x^4 - 3x + 2)(x^4 - 3x + 2)$, the only term that has a degree of $3$ will be the term found by multiplying together the three linear terms
Thus, the desired coefficient is the coefficient is $(-3)(-3)(-3)=\boxed{-27}$.
The number of people mowing and the time required to mow are inversely proportional
Letting $n$ be the number of people and $t$ be the amount of time, we have $nt = (4)(6)= 24$ because 4 people can mow a lawn in 6 hours
If $m$ people can mow the lawn in 4 hours, then we must have $m(4) = 24$, so $m=6$
Therefore, we need $6-4 = \boxed{2}$ more people to complete the job in 4 hours.
Let the first term be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$
Then the four positive integers are $a$, $a + d$, $a + 2d$, and $a + 3d$
The sum of these four positive integers is $4a + 6d = 46$, so $2a + 3d = 23$
Solving for $d$, we find $d = (23 - 2a)/3$.
The third term is \[a + 2d = a + 2 \cdot \frac{23 - 2a}{3} = \frac{46 - a}{3}.\] Thus, to maximize this expression, we should minimize $a$
Since $a$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $a$ is 1
Furthermore, when $a = 1$, $d = (23 - 2)/3 = 7$, which gives us the arithmetic sequence 1, 8, 15, 22
Therefore, the greatest possible third term is $\boxed{15}$.
When $x\in \left(-\frac{7}{3},2\right)$, we have $x\cdot(3x+1)-c<0$
This means that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ at $x=-\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$
We now know that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ is a quadratic equation with roots at $x=-\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$, and we want to use these roots to find a quadratic of the same form as the problem
$x=-\frac{7}{3}$ gives us $(3x+7)=0$ and $x=2$ gives us $(x-2)=0$
\begin{align*}
x(3x+1)-c&=(3x+7)(x-2)\\
&=3x^2+x-14\\
&=x(3x+1)-14.
\end{align*} So, $c=\boxed{14}$.
We work from the inside out
Since $1+i$ is not real, $f(1+i)=(1+i)^2=1+2i-1=2i$
So $f(f(f(f(1+i))))=f(f(f(2i)))$
Since $2i$ is also non-real, $f(2i)=(2i)^2=-4$
So $f(f(f(2i)))=f(f(-4))$
Since $-4$ is real, $f(-4)=-(-4)^2=-16$
So $f(f(-4))=f(-16)$
Since $-16$ is real, $f(-16)=\boxed{-256}$.
We can find this answer by plugging 5 into the function: \begin{align*} f(5)& = \dfrac{5+1}{3(5)-4}
\\ & = \dfrac{6}{15-4}
\\ & = \boxed{\dfrac{6}{11}}
\end{align*}
If the clever shopper takes $4 off followed by $20\%$ off, the book will cost $0.8 \times (\$25 - \$4) = 0.8 \times \$21 = \$16.80$
If she takes $20\%$ off followed by $4 off, it will cost $(0.8 \times \$25) - \$4 = \$20 - \$4 = \$16.00$
She will save $\$16.80 - 16.00 = \$0.80 = \boxed{80\text{ cents}}$ by taking the better-valued approach.
We have  \[\sqrt[4]{2^7\cdot3^3} = \sqrt[4]{2^4}\sqrt[4]{2^3\cdot3^3} = 2\sqrt[4]{8\cdot27} = 2\sqrt[4]{216}.\] Therefore, $a+b = \boxed{218}$.
Applying the midpoint formula gives $$\left(\frac{1+9}{2},\frac{6-2}{2}\right)=\boxed{(5,2)}.$$
Since there were $20$ males last year, there are $1.05 \cdot 20 =21$ males this year.
We set the number of females last year as $x$
This means that there are $1.2x$ females this year.
In total, there were $20+x$ people in the league last year, and $1.1 \cdot (20+x)$ this year
We then have: \begin{align*}
22+1.1x &= 21+1.2x \\
1 &= 0.1x \\
x &= 10.
\end{align*} Therefore, there were $10$ girls last year
This means there are $1.2 \cdot 10 =12$ girls this year
So there are $\frac{12}{12+21}=\frac{12}{33}=\boxed{\frac{4}{11}}$ girls out of the participants this year.
$MATH$ is 35 points, and $H$ is 10 points, so $MAT$ is 25 points
$TEAM = E + MAT$, so $E = 42 - 25 = 17$ points
$MEET$ is 38 points, and $E$ is 17 points, so $MT = 38 - 2 \cdot 17 = 4$ points
Finally, because $TEAM = E + MT + A$, we can solve for $A$: $17 + 4 + A = 42$, so $A= 42 - 17 - 4 = \boxed{21}$ points.
The first 10 positive odd integers are 1, 3, $\dots$, 19
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum of the first 10 positive odd integers is \[\frac{1 + 19}{2} \cdot 10 = \boxed{100}.\]
First, we would like to find where $y = 5x + 3$ and $y = -2x - 25$ intersect
We can represent this geometric intersection by setting the $y$'s equal to each other, giving $5x+3 = -2x - 25$
Solving this yields $x = -4$, so $y = 5\cdot (-4) + 3$, or $y = -17$
Now, we can plug $x$ and $y$ into the last equation to solve for $k$: $-17 = -12 + k$, so $k = \boxed{-5}$.
We note that if $a^2 < n \leq (a+1)^2$ for some integer $a$, then $a < \sqrt{x} \leq a+1$, so $a$ is the least integer greater than or equal to $x$
Consequently, we break up our sum into the blocks of integers between consecutive perfect squares:
For $5\leq n \leq 9$, $\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil=3$
There are $5$ values of $3$ in this range.
For $10\leq n\leq 16$, $\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil=4$
There are $7$ values of $4$ in this range.
For $17\leq n \leq 25$, $\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil=5$
There are $9$ values of $5$ in this range.
For $26\leq n \leq 29$, $\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil=6$
There are $4$ values of $6$ in this range.
Consequently, our total sum is $5\cdot3+7\cdot4+9\cdot5+4\cdot 6= \boxed{112}$.
Because $h(x) = f(x)\cdot g(x)$, the constant term of $h$ equals the product of the constant terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$
We are told that the constant terms of $h(x)$ and $f(x)$ are 3 and $-4$, respectively
Let the constant term of $g(x)$ be $c$
When we evaluate $g(0)$, all terms with $x$ in them equal 0, so we are left with the constant term, $c$
Therefore, $g(0) = c$
So, we must have $3 = (-4)\cdot c$, from which we find $c=\boxed{-\frac{3}{4}}$.
Call the two positive integers $x$ and $y$
Without loss of generality, assume $x > y$
We can write a system of equations to represent the information given in the problem:  \begin{align*}
x - y &= 2 \\
x \cdot y &= 120
\end{align*} Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = y + 2$.
Substituting this into the second equation gives $(y + 2) \cdot y = 120$, or $y^2 + 2y - 120 = 0$.
This quadratic equation factors into $(y + 12)(y-10) = 0$, so $y = 10$.
Given $y$, we can solve for $x$ to get $x = 12$, so $x + y = \boxed{22}$.
We see that $16x^2-106x-105 = (8x + 7)(2x - 15)$, thus $a = 7$ and $b = -15$ and $a + 2b = \boxed{-23}.$
Let such a real number be $x$
We have the property that $x+\frac{1}{x}=2x$, or $x=\frac{1}{x} \Rightarrow x^2-1=0$
Thus, the product of the (both real) solutions is $-1\cdot 1=\boxed{-1}$.
Adding all four equations together results in $3w+3x+3y+3z = 33 \Rightarrow w+x+y+z = 11$
Subtracting the four original equations from this sum gives: $z = 11-(-2) = 13$, $y = 11-4 = 7$, $x = 11-19 = -8$, and $w = 11-12 = -1$, respectively
Therefore, $wx + yz = -1\cdot-8 + 7\cdot13 = 8+91 = \boxed{99}$
We can rewrite the equation $x^2+2y-9=-y^2+18x+9$ as $x^2-18x+y^2+2y=18$
Completing the square, we have $(x-9)^2-81+(y+1)^2-1=18$, or $(x-9)^2+(y+1)^2=100$
This is the equation of a circle of radius $r=10$ and with center $(a,b)=(9,-1)$
Therefore, $a+b+r=9+-1+10=\boxed{18}$.
To determine the horizontal asymptotes, we consider what happens as $x$ becomes very large
It appears that, as $x$ becomes very large, the rational function becomes more and more like  \[y\approx\frac{5x^2}{3x^2},\]so it should become closer and closer to $\frac53$.
We can see this explicitly by dividing both the numerator and denominator by $x^2$
This gives  \[y=\frac{5-\frac{9}{x^2}}{3+\frac{5}{x}+\frac{2}{x^2}}.\]Indeed, as $x$ gets larger, all of the terms other than 5 in the numerator and 3 in the denominator become very small, so the horizontal asymptote is $y=\boxed{\frac53}$.
To find the $y$-coordinates of the intersections, substitute $y^4$ for $x$ in $x+y^2=1$ and solve for $y$, resulting in  \begin{align*}
y^4+y^2&=1 \\
\Rightarrow \qquad y^4+y^2-1&=0 \\
\Rightarrow \qquad y^2&=\frac{-1\pm\sqrt{1+4}}2=\frac{-1\pm\sqrt5}2\\
\end{align*}But $y^2$ is positive, so we reject $\frac{-1-\sqrt5}2$
Therefore $y=\pm\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt5-1}2}$.
Using each of these coordinates to solve for $x$ gives us the intersections at  $\left(\frac{3-\sqrt5}2,\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt5-1}2}\right)$ and  $\left(\frac{3-\sqrt5}2,-\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt5-1}2}\right)$
Using the distance formula, we have
\begin{align*}
&\sqrt{ \left(\frac{3-\sqrt5}2-\frac{3-\sqrt5}2\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt5-1}2}+\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt5-1}2}\right)^2 }\\
&\qquad=\sqrt{\left(2\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt5-1}2}\right)^2}\\
&\qquad=2\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt5-1}{2} }\\
&\qquad=\sqrt{2\sqrt5-2}.
\end{align*}So, $(u,v)=\boxed{(-2,2)}.$
Since $81 = 3^4$, we have  \[3^m = (81)^{\frac12} = (3^4)^{\frac12} = 3^{4\cdot \frac12} = 3^2,\] which means $m=\boxed{2}$.
Let $d$ be the original denominator
After adding 5 to both numerator and denominator, the fraction becomes $\frac{7}{d+5}$
If a fraction with 7 in the numerator is equivalent to $\frac{1}{2}$, then the denominator is 14
Solving $d+5=14$, we find $d=\boxed{9}$.
Suppose that $B = x$
Then $A = 2x$ and $C = 4x$
Thus $(3A + 2B)\div (4C - A) = \frac{8x}{14x} = \frac{8}{14}=\boxed{\frac{4}{7}}$.
$x^2 - y^2$ factors into $(x+y)(x-y)$, so, to obtain the value of $x^2 - y^2$, simply multiply $\frac{7}{12}\cdot \frac{1}{12}$ to get $\boxed{\frac{7}{144}}$.
We use the distance formula to find that the distance is  $$\sqrt{(3-(-2))^2+(-8-4)^2}=\sqrt{25+144}=\sqrt{169}=\boxed{13}.$$
Expanding the left square, we see that the given expression equals $25^2 + 2\cdot25\cdot8 + 8^2 - 8^2 - 25^2 = 2\cdot25\cdot8 = \boxed{400}$.
Sum the first two equations to find $c+o+n=t.$ Solve the third equation for $c$ to find $c=s-t,$ and substitute $s-t$ for $c$ in $c+o+n=t$ to find $o+n+s-t=t\implies o+n+s=2t.$ Substitute $12$ for $o+n+s$ to find $t=12/2=\boxed{6}.$
We have $a = 1\frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$
When $a=\frac{3}{2}$, we find $2a-3=2\cdot\frac{3}{2} - 3 = 3-3=0$, so the given expression equals $5a^2 -13a+4$ times 0, which is $\boxed{0}$.
Dave rode a total of $40$ miles
The $30$ mile segment took $\frac{30}{10}=3$ hours, while the $10$ mile segment took $\frac{10}{30}=\frac{1}{3}$ hours, so the full ride took $3+\frac{1}{3}=\frac{10}{3}$ hours.
So the average speed was  $\frac{40}{\frac{10}{3}}=\boxed{12}$ miles per hour.
x^2+5x-6=(-1)^2+5(-1)-6=1-5-6=\boxed{-10}.
From the defined function, we know that $5\ast 2 = 3(5)+4(2)-(5)(2)=15+8-10=\boxed{13}$.
Letting the original number be $x$, we must have $$1+\frac{1}{x}=\frac{7}{3}.$$ Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $$\dfrac{1}{x} = \dfrac{4}{3}.$$ Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives  $x=\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.$
From the information given, we can set up the following equation: $pt = (2p-4)(t-2)$
Simplifying this, we get $pt - 4p - 4t = -8$
Now, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $16$ to both sides to get $pt - 4p - 4t + 16 = 8$
This factors to $$(p-4)(t-4)=8$$Since $p>10$, the only possible combination of $p$ and $t$ is $p=12$ and $t=5$
Thus, I did a total of $12 \cdot 5 = \boxed{60}$ problems.
After doing so twice, he gets $25$
He then divides $25$ by $2$ to get $12.5$, and then takes the greatest integer to get $12$
He now divides by $2$ twice to get $3$
Finally, he divides by $2$ to get $1.5$ and takes the greatest integer to get $1$
This is a total of $\boxed{6}$ times.
Let $n, n+1, \dots , n+17$ be the 18 consecutive integers
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is \[\frac{n + (n + 17)}{2} \cdot 18 = 9(2n + 17).\]Since 9 is a perfect square, $2n+17$ must also be a perfect square
The smallest value of $n$ for which this occurs is  $n = 4$, so  $9(2n+17) = 9\cdot 25 = \boxed{225}$.
We could substitute $(-21-\sqrt{301})/10$ for $x$ in the equation, but the quadratic formula suggests a quicker approach
Substituting $5$, $21$, and $v$ into the quadratic formula gives  \[
\frac{-(21)\pm\sqrt{(21)^2-4(5)(v)}}{2(5)}= \frac{-21\pm\sqrt{441-20v}}{10}.
\]Setting $(-21+\sqrt{441-20v})/10$ and $(-21-\sqrt{441-20v})/10$ equal to $(-21-\sqrt{301})/10$, we find no solution in the first case and $441-20v=301$ in the second case
Solving yields $v=(301-441)/(-20)=(-140)/(-20)=\boxed{7}$.
We have $\frac{6^2 + 6^2}{6} = \frac{6^2}{6} + \frac{6^2}{6} = 6 + 6 = 12$ and $\frac{6^2 \times 6^2}{6} = \frac{6^2}{6}\times 6^2 = 6\times 6^2 = 6\times 36 = 216$, so the positive difference between the two is $216 - 12 = \boxed{204}$.
$t^3\cdot t^4 = t^{3+4} = \boxed{t^7}$.
Squaring both sides, $$1 + \sqrt{2y-3} = \left(\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{2y-3}}\right)^2 = \left(\sqrt{6}\right)^2 = 6.$$Hence, $\sqrt{2y-3} = 5$
If we square this equation again, then $$2y - 3 = \left(\sqrt{2y-3}\right)^2 = 5^2 = 25 \Longrightarrow y = \frac{25+3}{2} = \boxed{14}.$$
An $x$-intercept is a point on the graph that lies on the $x$-axis, so $y = 0$
When $y = 0$, $x = 3$, so $a = 3$.
A $y$-intercept is a point on the graph that lies on the $y$-axis, so $x = 0$
Hence, the $y$-intercepts correspond to the real roots of the quadratic equation $2y^2 - 6y + 3 = 0$
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this quadratic is $6/2 = 3$, so $b + c = 3$.
Therefore, $a + b + c = 3 + 3 = \boxed{6}$.

We can find $x$ by adding twice the first equation to five times the second
From \begin{align*}
2(3x-5y)+5(7x+2y)&=6x+35x\\&=41x,
\end{align*}and \begin{align*}
2(3x-5y)+5(7x+2y)&=2(-11)+5(-12)\\&=-22-60\\&=-82,
\end{align*}we find that $41x = -82$, or $x=-2.$
Substituting into the second equation, we can find $y:$ \begin{align*}
7x+2y&=-12 \\ \implies y&=\frac{1}{2}(-12-7(-2))\\&=\frac{1}{2}(-12+14)\\&=\frac{1}{2}(2)\\&=1.
\end{align*}Thus our answer is $\boxed{(-2,1)}.$
Taking the product of the equations gives  \begin{align*}
xy\cdot xz\cdot yz &= 20\sqrt[3]{2} \cdot 35\sqrt[3]{2} \cdot 14\sqrt[3]{2}\\
(xyz)^2 &= 2^4\cdot5^2\cdot7^2\\
xyz &= 2^2\cdot5\cdot7 = \pm 140
\end{align*} Since we were given that $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive, we can conclude that $xyz = \boxed{140}$.
Multiplying top and bottom by the conjugate, we have $\frac{\sqrt{8}+\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}} = \frac{(\sqrt{8}+\sqrt{3})(\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3})}{(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})(\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3})}$
Simplifying, we obtain $\frac{\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{24}+\sqrt{6}-\sqrt{9}}{\sqrt{4}-\sqrt{9}} = \frac{1-\sqrt{6}}{-1} = \boxed{\sqrt{6}-1}$.
We substitute the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ to get $$(-3)^2+(5)^2-(-4)^2+2(-3)(5)=9+25-16-30=34-46=\boxed{-12}.$$
Evaluating the first term, $\frac {12}7 \cdot \frac{-29}{3} = \frac{-116}{7}$
Since $$-17 = \frac{-119}{7} < \frac{-116}{7} < \frac{-112}{7} = -16,$$ the ceiling of $\frac{-116}{7}$ is $-16$.
In the second term, since $$-10 = \frac{-30}{3} < \frac{-29}{3} < \frac{-27}{3} = -9,$$ then the floor of $\frac{-29}3$ is $-10$
The product of this with $\frac{12}{7}$ is $\frac{-120}{7}$
Since $$-18 = \frac{-126}{7} < \frac{-120}{7} < \frac{-119}{7} = -17,$$ the floor of $\frac{-120}{7}$ is $-18$
Hence, the answer is $-16 - (-18) = \boxed{2}$.
We want to evaluate the arithmetic series $4+5+\dots+11$.
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms
The number of terms is $11 - 4 + 1 = 8$, so the sum is $(4 + 11)/2 \cdot 8 = \boxed{60}$.
To find the area, we must first find the length of the radius, $PQ$
Using the distance formula, we have the radius is $\sqrt{(-3-9)^2+(4-(-3))^2}=\sqrt{193}$.
Now that we know the radius has length $\sqrt{193}$, the area is $\pi \cdot (\sqrt{193})^2=\boxed{193\pi}$.
Let $b$ be the weight of one bowling ball and $c$ be the weight of one canoe
We have that $7b=3c$
Multiplying both sides by $\frac{2}{3}$, we have $\frac{2}{3} \cdot 7b=\frac{2}{3} \cdot 3c \Rightarrow \frac{14}{3}b=2c=56$
Solving this last equation for $b$, we have that one bowling ball weighs $\boxed{12}$ pounds.
Call the two numbers $x$ and $y$
We are given that $x+y = 6$ and $x^2 - y^2 = 12$
Because $x^2 - y^2$ factors into $(x+y)(x-y)$, we can substitute in for $x+y$, giving $6(x-y) = 12$, or $x-y = \boxed{2}$.
We see that
$$1\nabla 2=2+2^1=4$$
$$4\nabla 3=2+3^4=83$$
So the answer is $\boxed{83}$.
We can simplify: $$\ell(y) = \frac{1}{2y-10}.$$ The fraction $\frac{1}{2y-10}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero
This occurs when $y$ is the solution of the equation $$2y-10=0,$$ which is $y=5$
Thus the domain of $\ell(y)$ is $\boxed{(-\infty,5)\cup (5,\infty)}$.
We apply the distributive property repeatedly:
\begin{align*}
(x+10)(2y+10) &= x(2y+10) + 10(2y+10)\\
&= x\cdot 2y + x\cdot 10 + 10\cdot 2y + 10\cdot 10\\
&= \boxed{2xy + 10x + 20y + 100}.
\end{align*}
Because $5\ge -3$, we use the second case to determine that $f(5) = 7-4(5) = \boxed{-13}$.
We begin by examining the quantity $|\pi - 7|$
Since $\pi$ is less than 4, clearly $\pi-7$ will be negative
Hence we must negate this quantity to obtain its absolute value, which is always positive
In other words, \[ |\pi - 7| = -(\pi - 7) = 7- \pi
\]Continuing, we next consider the expression $\pi-|\pi - 7|$, which reduces to $2\pi - 7$ in light of the above computation
Since $\pi$ is less than 3.5, this quantity is also negative
Hence we must negate it just as before when taking absolute value, leading to our final answer of $\boxed{7-2\pi}.$
Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$
Then the third term is $a + 2d = 17$, and the fifth term is $a + 4d = 39$
Subtracting these equations, we get $2d = 22$.
Then the seventh term is $a + 6d = (a + 4d) + 2d = 39 + 22 = \boxed{61}$.
Multiplying all three gives equations gives us \[\frac{a}{b} \cdot\frac{b}{c}\cdot \frac{c}{d} = 4\cdot \frac{1}{3}\cdot 6,\]so \[\frac{a}{d}= 8.\] Taking the reciprocal of both sides of this equation gives $d/a = \boxed{\frac{1}{8}}$.
To start, we solve Lauren's equation
If $x-5$ is positive, then: $$|x-5|=x-5=2$$ $$x=7$$ On the other hand, if $x-5$ is negative, then: $$|x-5|=5-x=2$$ $$x=3$$ Jane's quadratic equation must have roots of 7 and 3
In factored form , this quadratic will look like: $$(x-3)(x-7)=0$$ Expanding, we find Jane's equation is: $$x^2-10x+21=0$$ The ordered pair is $\boxed{(-10,21)}$.
As shown by the graph, there are $3$ values of $x$ for which $f(x) = 3$: when $x = -3$, $1$, or $5$
If $f(f(x)) = 3$, it follows then that $f(x) = -3, 1, 5$
There are no values of $x$ such that $f(x) = -3$
There is exactly one value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 1$ and $5$, namely $x = -1$ and $3$, respectively
Thus, there are $\boxed{2}$ possible values of $x$.
Note that we have a difference of squares: $(722)(724) = (723 - 1)(723 + 1) = 723^2 - 1^2$
Thus, this expression evaluates to $(723)(723) - (722)(724) = 723^2 - (723^2 - 1^2) = 1^2 = \boxed{1}$.
Notice that $501^2 - 499^2$ can also be expressed as $(501+499)(501-499)$
This is the same as $1000 \cdot 2$, so our answer is $\boxed{2000}$.
In the equation $\frac{12\star2}{9*3}=2$, the numerator of the fraction in the left hand side must be double the denominator
By trial and error, there are two ways to do this
In the first way, the $\star$ operation is multiplication and the $*$ operation is addition, in which case the equation becomes $\frac{12\cdot2}{9+3}=\frac{24}{12}=2$
Thus, the value of the given expression is $\frac{7\cdot3}{12+6}=\frac{21}{18}=7/6$
In the second way, the $\star$ operation is division and the $*$ operation is also division, in which case the equation becomes $\frac{12/2}{9/3}=\frac{6}{3}=2$
Thus, the value of the given expression is $\frac{7/3}{12/6}=\frac{7/3}{2}=7/6$, which is the same as in the first case
In either case, our answer is $\boxed{\frac{7}{6}}$.
We see that $-4$ is not in the range of $f(x) = x^2 + bx + 12$ if and only if the equation $x^2 + bx + 12 = -4$ has no real roots
We can re-write this equation as $x^2 + bx + 16 = 0$
The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \cdot 16 = b^2 - 64$
The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 64 < 0$, or $b^2 < 64$
The greatest integer $b$ that satisfies this inequality is $b = \boxed{7}$.
The fraction $\frac{1}{(t-1)^2+(t+1)^2}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero
But $(t-1)^2$ and $(t+1)^2$ are both nonnegative for all $t$, and are never simultaneously $0$, so their sum is always positive (and, specifically, nonzero)
Therefore, the domain of $f(t)$ is all real numbers or, in interval notation, $\boxed{(-\infty,\infty)}$.
We have $8=2^3$ or $8^{\frac13}=2$, so $\log_8 2=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$
If Tom can mow a lawn in $5$ hours, then in one hour, he can mow $1/5$ of the lawn
Since he mows for $2$ hours, he finished mowing $2 \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{5}$ of the lawn
This leaves $1 - \frac{2}{5} = \boxed{\frac{3}{5}}$ of the lawn left to be mowed.
Let the first term be $a$
Because the sum of the series is 60, we have  $$60= \frac{a}{1-(1/8)} = \frac{a}{7/8} = \frac{8a}{7}.$$Therefore, $a=\frac{7}{8}\cdot60=\boxed{\frac{105}{2}}$.
To start, we can find the $y$-intercept of each of these lines
Using this, we can calculate the length of that side of the triangle, and use it as a base
Letting $x=0$ in the first equation gives $y=-2$ as a $y$-intercept
Letting $x=0$ in the second equation gives $3y=12\Rightarrow y=4$ as a $y$-intercept
Therefore, the triangle has a length of $4-(-2)=6$ on the $y$-axis.
The height of the triangle will be equal to the $x$-coordinate of the intersection of the two lines
So, we need to solve for $x$ in the system: \begin{align*}
y-3x&=-2\\
3y+x&=12
\end{align*}Multiply the first equation by 3, then subtract the second equation as shown: \begin{tabular}{ r c c c l}
$3y$&-&$9x$&=&-6\\
-($3y$&+&$x$&=&12)\\ \hline
&-&$10x$&=&-18\\
\end{tabular}Therefore, $x=\frac{18}{10}=\frac{9}{5}$
This is equal to the height of the triangle
The area will be $\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{9}{5}\cdot 6=\boxed{\frac{27}{5}}$
The line $x = k$ intersects the graph of the parabola $x = -2y^2 - 3y + 5$ at exactly one point if and only if the equation $-2y^2 - 3y + 5 = k$ has exactly one real solution
This equation is equivalent to \[2y^2 + 3y + (k - 5) = 0,\] and this equation has exactly one real solution if and only if the discriminant is 0
The discriminant of this quadratic is $3^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (k - 5)$
Setting this equal to 0 and solving for $k$, we find $k = \boxed{\frac{49}{8}}$
(Note that this is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola.)

We have $ 27\sqrt3 = (3^3)(3^\frac12)=3^{(3+\frac12)}=3^{\frac72}$
Therefore, $\log_3 27\sqrt3=\boxed{\frac72}$.
Since $y$ and $\sqrt{x}$ are inversely proportional, this means that $y\sqrt{x}=k$ for some constant $k$
Substituting the given values, when $x=2$ and $y=4$, we find that $4\sqrt{2}=k$
Therefore, when $y=1$, we can solve for $x$: \begin{align*}
1\cdot\sqrt{x}&=4\sqrt{2}\\
\Rightarrow\qquad (\sqrt{x})^2&=(4\sqrt{2})^2\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x&=16\cdot2=\boxed{32}
\end{align*}
Multiplying out that entire polynomial would be pretty ugly, so let's see if there's a faster way
The degree of $(2x^4+3x^3+x-14)(3x^{10}-9x^7+9x^4+30)$ is the highest possible power of $x$, which occurs when we multiply $(2x^4)(3x^{10})$
This gives $6x^{14}$ so the degree of the first part is $14$
To find the degree of $(x^2+5)^7$, we need to find the highest possible power of $x$
This product is equivalent to multiplying $(x^2+5)$ by itself $7$ times, and each term is created by choosing either $x^2$ or $5$ from each of the seven factors
To get the largest power of $x$, we should choose $x^2$ from all seven factors, to find $(x^2)^7=x^{14}$ as the highest power of $x$, so the second part is also a degree-$14$ polynomial
Thus we have a degree-$14$ polynomial minus a degree-$14$ polynomial, which will give us another degree-$14$ polynomial..
unless the $x^{14}$ terms cancel out
We must check this
In the first part, the coefficient on $x^{14}$ was $6$, and in the second part the coefficient was $1$
So our expression will look like $(6x^{14}+\ldots)-(x^{14}+\ldots)$ where all the other terms have degree less than $14$, so when simplified the expression will be $5x^{14}+\ldots$
Thus the coefficient on the $x^{14}$ term is not zero, and the polynomial has degree $\boxed{14}$.
Suppose Betty buys $f$ pounds of flour and $s$ pounds of sugar
From the problem, we have $f \ge 6+s/2$ and $f \le 2s$
Putting these together, we have $2s \ge f \ge 6 +s/2$
The expression on the left end of this inequality chain must therefore be greater than or equal to the $6+s/2$ on the right, so \[2s \ge 6 + s/2 \implies 3s/2 \ge 6 \implies s\ge \boxed{4}.\]
The line $x=k$ intersects $y=x^2+6x+5$ at the point $(k, k^2+6k+5)$ and the line $y=mx+b$ at the point $(k,mk+b)$
Since these two points have the same $x$-coordinate, the distance between them is the difference of their $y$-coordinates, so we have $$|(k^2+6k+5)-(mk+b)|=5.$$ Simplifying, this gives us two quadratic equations: $k^2+(6-m)k+5-b=5$ and $k^2+(6-m)k+5-b=-5$
We can express these as  \begin{align*}
k^2+(6-m)k-b=0&\quad(1)\\
k^2+(6-m)k+10-b=0.&\quad(2)
\end{align*} We know that all solutions to both of these equations will be places where the line $y=mx+b$ is a vertical distance of $5$ from the parabola, but we know there can only be one such solution! Thus there must be exactly $1$ solution to one of the equations, and no solutions to the other equation
We find the discriminants ($b^2-4ac$) of the equations, so for equation $(1)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(-b)=(6-m)^2+4b$
For equation $(2)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(10-b)=(6-m)^2+4b-40$
One of these equations must equal zero, and one must be less than zero
Since $-40<0$, adding $(6-m)^2+4b$ to both sides doesn't change the inequality and $(6-m)^2+4b-40<(6-m)^2+4b$, so the greater value must be equal to zero so that the lesser value is always less than zero
Thus we have $(6-m)^2+4b=0$.
We are also given that the line $y=mx+b$ passes through the point $(1,6)$, so substituting $x=1$ and $y=6$ gives $6=(1)m+b$ or $m+b=6$
This means that $6-m=b$, so we can substitute in the above equation: \begin{align*}
(6-m)^2+4b&=0\quad\Rightarrow\\
(b)^2+4b&=0\quad\Rightarrow\\
b(b+4)&=0.
\end{align*} We are given that $b\neq 0$, so the only solution is $b=-4$
When we plug this into the equation $m+b=6$, we find $m-4=6$ so $m=10$
Thus the equation of the line is $y=mx+b$ or $\boxed{y=10x-4}$.
Work from the inside out: \begin{align*}
2\,\spadesuit\,(4\,\spadesuit\, 7)&=2\,\spadesuit\,(|4-7|) \\
&=2\,\spadesuit\,|-3|\\
&=2\,\spadesuit\, 3 \\
&= |2-3| \\
&= \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
Multiplying the first equation by $2$ gives $10u = -14 - 4v$
Adding this to the second equation gives $13u = -39$, so $ u= -3$
Substituting this into $5u=-7-2v$ gives $-15=-7-2v$, so $v = 4$ and our solution is $(u,v) =\boxed{(-3,4)}$.
Call the two integers $x$ and $y$
Without loss of generality, let $x$ be the larger of the two
We are given that $x+y = 50$ and $x-y = 12$, and we are asked for $x^2 - y^2$
Because $x^2 - y^2$ factors into $(x+y)(x-y)$, we can simply substitute in to get $x^2 - y^2 = 50 \cdot 12 = \boxed{600}$.
Since $100 = 10^2$, we have \[10^x = 100^3 = (10^2)^3 = 10^{2\cdot 3} = 10^6,\] so $x = \boxed{6}$.
Observe that for a natural number $n$ we have $\lfloor -n -.5 \rfloor \cdot \lceil n +.5 \rceil = -(n+1)^2$
Hence, the expression in question reduces to $(-5^2)(-4^2) (-3^2) (-2^2) (-1^2) = - (5!)^2 = \boxed{-14400}$.
Because $\sqrt{27} = 27^{\frac{1}{2}} = (3^3)^\frac{1}{2} = 3^{\frac{3}{2}}$, we have $3^{2x}=3^{\frac{3}{2}}$
This gives us $2x=\frac{3}{2}$, so $x=\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.
Let the first odd integer be $a$
Let the rest of the odd integers be $a+2, a+4, a+6, \dots , a+ 2(n-1)$, for a total of $n$ integers
The arithmetic mean of these integers is equal to their sum divided by the number of integers, so we have  \[ y = \frac{na + (2+4+6+\dots + 2(n-1))}{n}\] Notice that $2+4+6+\dots + 2(n-1) = 2(1+2+3+\dots + n-1) = 2\frac{(n-1)(n-1+1)}{2} = n(n-1)$
Substituting and multiplying both sides by $n$ yields \[ yn = na + n(n-1)\] Dividing both sides by $n$, we have  \[ y = a+ n-1\] The sum of the smallest and largest integers is $a + a+ 2(n-1)$, or $2a+2(n-1)=2(a+n-1)=2y$.
Hence the answer is $\boxed{2y}$.
We proceed as follows: \begin{align*}
(2b + 5)(b - 1) &= 6b\\
2b^2 + 3b - 5 &= 6b\\
2b^2 - 3b - 5 &= 0\\
(2b - 5)(b + 1) &= 0.
\end{align*}This gives us $b = \frac{5}{2}$ or $b = -1.$ Of these, $\boxed{\frac{5}{2}}$ is the larger possible value of $b.$
The coefficient of $x^2$ in $4(x - x^3) - 3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) + 2(4x^2 - x^9)$ is $-3 + 2 \cdot 4 = \boxed{5}$.
$$\frac{18^2-16^2}{2}=\frac{(18-16)(18+16)}{2}=\frac{(2)(34)}{2}=\boxed{34}$$
Since $v$ appears in the first row, first column, and on diagonal, the sum of the remaining two numbers in each of these lines must be the same
Thus, $$25+18 = 24 +w = 21+x,$$ so $w = 19$ and $x=22$
now 25,22, and 19 form a diagonal with a sum of 66, so we can find $v=23$, $y=26$, and $z=20$
Hence $y+z=\boxed{46}$.
Let $k = x+\frac 1x$
Notice that $k^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac 1{x^2}$, so $x^2 + \frac 1{x^2} = k^2-2$
Substituting this into the equation gives $(k^2-2) + 3 \cdot (k) = 26$, or $k^2 + 3k - 28 = (k+7)(k-4) = 0$
Since $x$ is positive, then $k > 0$, so $k = 4$
Substituting back, $x + \frac 1x = 4 \Longrightarrow x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 \Longrightarrow x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = 2 \pm \sqrt{3}$
To match the desired form, we take the solution $x = 2+\sqrt{3}$, and the answer is $\boxed{5}$.
Simplifying, we have  $12(x+y)=xy$, so $xy - 12x - 12y = 0.$ Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by adding 144 to both sides, we get $xy-12x-12y +144=144$, so \[(x-12)(y-12)=144.\]Now we seek the minimal $x+y,$ which occurs when $x-12$ and $y-12$ are as close to each other in value as possible
The two best candidates are $(x-12,y-12)=(18,8)$ or $(16,9),$ of which $(x,y)=(28,21)$ attains the minimum sum of $\boxed{49}$.
Ryosuke traveled a distance of $74,592 - 74,568 = 24$ miles between the time he picked up his friend and when he dropped him off
Since his car gets 28 miles per gallon, he used 24/28 or 12/14 of a gallon
At $\$4.05$ per gallon, the cost of the trip is about $12/14 \times 4.05 \approx \boxed{\$3.47}$.
First we bring $x$ to the left side to get  \[x^2-4x+9=41.\]We notice that the left side is almost the square $(x-2)^2=x^2-4x+4$
Subtracting 5 from both sides lets us complete the square on the left-hand side, \[x^2-4x+4=36,\]so  \[(x-2)^2=6^2.\]Therefore $x=2\pm6$
The positive difference between these solutions is $8-(-4)=\boxed{12}$.
The absolute value of a real number is equal to $3$ if and only if the number is $3$ or $-3$
Solving $2n-7=3$ and $2n-7=-3$ we find the solutions $n=5$ and $n=2$
The sum of these solutions is $5+2=\boxed{7}$.
Plugging $x = 4$ into the first equation, we get $4^{2y} = 4^1 \Rightarrow 2y = 1 \Rightarrow y = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
By definition of $p$, for any prime number $x$ such that $2 \le x \le 10$, then $[x+1,x+2) \subset \text{range}\,(p)$
It follows that $[3,4) \cup [4,5) \cup [6,7) \cup [8,9) \subset \text{range}\,(p)$
Since the largest prime factor of a composite number less than or equal to $10$ is $5$, then the largest possible value of $p$ on a composite number is $p(10) = p(5)+1 = 7$
Also, we notice that $[5,6) \subset \text{range}\,(p)$, since for any $x \in [6,7)$, then $p(x) = p(3) + (x + 1 - \lfloor x \rfloor) = 5 + x - \lfloor x \rfloor$
Combining all of this, it follows that the range of $p$ is equal to $[3,5) \cup [6,7) \cup [8,9) \cup \{7\} \cup [5,6) = \boxed{[3,7] \cup [8,9)}$.
Reading the table, we see that $f(f(3)) = f(5) = 8.$
Although we can't look up $f^{-1}(4)$ in the table, we know that $f(f^{-1}(4)) = 4,$ since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ for all $x$ (by the definition of an inverse function).
Since $f(3) = 5,$ we have $f^{-1}(5) = 3,$ and so $$f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) = f^{-1}(3).$$Then, since $f(2) = 3,$ we have $$f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) = f^{-1}(3) = 2.$$Combining the information above, we get $$f(f(3)) + f(f^{-1}(4)) + f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) = 8+4+2 = \boxed{14}.$$
Using the difference of squares factorization, we see that $(x+1)(x-1) = x^2-1$
Since we're given $x^2= 1521$, we can easily compute $x^2-1 = 1521-1 = \boxed{1520}$.
We know that $$4\bowtie y = 4+\sqrt{y+\sqrt{y+\sqrt{y+...}}}=10.$$Therefore, $\sqrt{y+\sqrt{y+\sqrt{y+...}}}=6$
Because the series of $\sqrt{y+\sqrt{y+\sqrt{y+...}}}$ is infinite, we can substitute $6$ into the series for any $\sqrt{y+\sqrt{y+\sqrt{y+...}}}$ we want
Thus, $$\sqrt{y+\sqrt{y+\sqrt{y+...}}}=6$$implies that $$\sqrt{y+\sqrt{y+\sqrt{y+...}}}=\sqrt{y+6}=6.$$Squaring both sides of this new equality, we have $y+6=36$, or $y=\boxed{30}$.
We rewrite the equation as follows, trying to create a square of a binomial on the left side: \begin{align*}
x^2 - 8x + 8 &= 0\\
x^2 - 8x + 16 &= 8\\
(x - 4)^2 &= 8.
\end{align*}Therefore, $b = -4$ and $c = 8$, and $b + c = \boxed{4}.$
We start by squaring both sides of the equation \begin{align*} (\sqrt{2x})^2&=(4x)^2
\\ \Rightarrow \qquad 2x&=16x^2
\\ \Rightarrow \qquad 16x^2-2x&=0
\\ \Rightarrow \qquad 8x^2-x&=0
\\ \Rightarrow \qquad x(8x-1)&=0
\end{align*}From here, we see that the two possible values of $x$ are $0$ and $\frac18$
Since the problem only asks for the largest value of $x$, the final answer is $\boxed{\frac18}$.
If $p$ and $q$ are inversely proportional, then $p\cdot{q}=k$ (where $k$ is a constant)
We know that $p=25$ when $q=6$, so $(25)(6)=k$ or $k=150$
Thus when $q=15$, $(p)(15)=150$ and $p=\boxed{10}$.
Since both of these points lie on the line, plugging them into the equation of the line will produce a true statement
Thus $(-2, 0)$ gives us $0 = -2m + b$ and $(0, 2)$ gives us $2 = b$
So we now know what $b$ is and can plug it back into the first equation to get $0 = -2m + 2$
So $m = 1$ and $m + b = \boxed{3}$.
Simplify both equations by dividing by 3: \begin{align*}
4x + 7y &= 5 \\
7x + 4y &= 17.
\end{align*} We solve this system using the elimination method
Multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by $-4$ to obtain \begin{align*}
28x + 49y &= 35 \\
-28x -16y &= -68.
\end{align*} Adding the equations gives $33y=-33$, so $y=-1$
Substituting $y=-1$ into either equation and solving, we get $x=3$
Therefore, $(x,y)=\boxed{(3,-1)}$.
Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$
Then the second term is $a + d = 17$, fifth term is $a + 4d = 19$, and the eighth term is $a + 7d$
Note that $(a + 4d) - (a + d) = 3d$, and $(a + 7d) - (a + 4d) = 3d$, so the terms $a + d = 17$, $a + 4d = 19$, and $a + 7d$ also form an arithmetic sequence.
If 17 and 19 are consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence, then the common difference is $19 - 17 = 2$, so the next term must be $19 + 2 = \boxed{21}$.
Let the number of liters of water in the tank originally be $w$, and let the number of liters of water the tank can hold when it is full be $c$
Originally, we have the equation $\frac{w}{c}=\frac{1}{5}$
Cross multiplying, we have $c = 5w$, or $w=\frac{c}{5}$
After three liters of water are added, we have the equation $\frac{w+3}{c} = \frac{1}{4}$
Cross multiplying, we have $c=4w+12$
Substituting the previous expression for $w$ into this last equation to eliminate $w$, we get $c=4(\frac{c}{5})+12$, or $c=60$
Thus, the number of liters of water the tank can hold is $\boxed{60}$.
Notice that for any $x$, then $N(O(x)) = N(x^2) = 2\sqrt{x^2} = 2x$
It follows that  $$N(O(N(O(N(O(3)))))) = N(O(N(O(6)))) = N(O(12)) = \boxed{24}.$$
Since $|m| > 0$, we can clear fractions from the inequalities, arriving at $8 \geq |m|$
This is satisfied for $-8 \leq m \leq 8$
There are 17 integers in this range, but 0 is not allowed, so our final answer is $\boxed{16}$.
Solving $pq = \frac{9}{2}$ for $p$ we see that $p = \frac{9}{2q}$
Plugging this into $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$ we then get \[ \frac{2q}{9} + \frac{1}{q} = 1 \Rightarrow 2q^2 - 9q +9 = 0 .\] Applying the quadratic equation we then see that  \[ q = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{81-72}}{4} = \frac{9 \pm 3}{4} .\] Now, the smaller root corresponds to $p$ and the larger to $q$, so we see that $\boxed{q = 3}$.
We use the distance formula:  \begin{align*}
\sqrt{(4 - (-3))^2 + ((-5) - (-4))^2} &= \sqrt{7^2 + (-1)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{49 + 1} \\
&= \sqrt{50} \\
&= \boxed{5\sqrt{2}}.
\end{align*}
The $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate of the midpoint are the averages of the $x$-coordinates and $y$-coordinates of the endpoints, respectively
Since $4-3=1$, the $x$-coordinate of the other endpoint is $1-3=-2$
Since $5-7=-2$, the $y$-coordinate of the other endpoint is $-2-7=-9$
Therefore, the endpoints are $(4,5)$ and $\boxed{(-2,-9)}$.
The radius of the first circle is 2, and the radius of the second circle is 10
The distances between the centers of the circles is $\sqrt{(17 - 2)^2 + (10 - 2)^2} = 17,$ so the distance between the two closest points of the two circle is $17 - 2 - 10 = \boxed{5}.$

Working backwards, we find that the four blanks contain the numbers $-11,-7,-3,1$
These numbers sum to $\boxed{-20}$.
We begin by writing $\frac{1}{4}$ and $16$ as powers of $2$
\begin{align*}
(2^{-2})^{2x+8} & = (2^4)^{2x+5} \\
2^{-4x-16} & = 2^{8x + 20} \\
-4x - 16 & = 8x + 20 \\
x & = \boxed{-3}
\end{align*}
We can factor the expression $x+2$ out of each term:  \begin{align*}
x(x+2)+(x+2) &= x \cdot (x+2)+1 \cdot (x+2)\\
&= \boxed{(x+1)(x+2)}
\end{align*}
Looking at the definition of $a \clubsuit b$, we see that $a \clubsuit b = \frac{2a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{a}=\frac{2a \cdot b}{b \cdot a} = \frac{2ab}{ab}.$ Both the numerator and denominator share a common factor of ab, so $a \clubsuit b = \frac{2 \cancel{ab}}{\cancel{ab}}=2.$ Thus, regardless of what a and b are (as long as neither are zero), $a \clubsuit b$ will always be 2
Looking at the given expression, a and b are never zero
Thus whatever the values of a and b, the expression will always evaluate to 2
Thus, the expression simplifies to $(5 \clubsuit (3 \clubsuit 6)) \clubsuit 1 = (5 \clubsuit 2) \clubsuit 1 = 2 \clubsuit 1 = \boxed{2}.$
We use the distance formula: $$\sqrt{(7-0)^2 + ((-24)-0)^2} = \sqrt{49+ 576} = \sqrt{625} = \boxed{25}.$$- OR -
Note that the origin, the point $(7, -24)$, and the point $(7, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 7 and 24
This is a Pythagorean triple, so the length of the hypotenuse is $\boxed{25}$.
The fact that $(3,6)$ is on the graph of $y=g(x)$ means that $g(3)=6$
Therefore, $h(3)=(g(3))^2=6^2=36$, which tells us that $(3,36)$ is on the graph of $y=h(x)$
The sum of the coordinates of this point is $\boxed{39}$.
To find the intersection, we must find the point satisfying both equations
Hence we must solve the system \begin{align*}
y&=-4x, \\
y-2&=12x.
\end{align*}Substituting the expression for $y$ in first equation into the second equation, we obtain $-4x-2=12x$
Solving for $x$ we find that $x=-\frac{1}{8}$
Plugging this into the first expression for $y$ above, we find that $y=-4\cdot -\frac{1}{8}=\frac{1}{2}$
So the intersection is $\boxed{\left(-\frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{2}\right)}$.
We might try to factor the quadratic, but unfortunately that doesn't get us anywhere
Instead, we start by subtracting $5t$ from both sides so as to isolate the fraction
This gives us  \[\frac{13t^2 -34t + 12}{3t-2 } = t-1.\]Multiplying both sides by $3t-2$ gives  \[13t^ 2-34t + 12 = (t-1)(3t-2).\]Expanding the right side gives $13t^2 - 34t + 12 = 3t^2 -5t+2$, so  $10t^2 -29t +10 = 0$
Factoring gives $(2t - 5)(5t-2)=0$, which has solutions $t=2/5$ and $t=5/2$
The largest of these is $\boxed{\frac{5}{2}}$.
$64^2 - 36^2$ can also be expressed as $(64+36)(64-36)$
This simplifies as $100 \cdot 28$, which equals $\boxed{2800}$.
We use the distance formula: \begin{align*}
\sqrt{(2 - (-6))^2 + (y - 5)^2} &= \sqrt{8^2 + (y - 5)^2} \\
& = \sqrt{y^2 - 10y + 89} \\
& = 10.
\end{align*}Squaring both sides and rearranging terms, we find that \begin{align*}
y^2 - 10y + 89 &= 100 \\
y^2 - 10y - 11 &= 0\\
(y - 11)(y + 1) &= 0
\end{align*}Thus, $y = 11$ or $y = -1$
We are given that $y > 0$, so $y = \boxed{11}$.
Since $x^2$ and $y$ are inversely proportional, their product is constant
Thus $$2^2 \cdot 10 = x^2 \cdot 4000 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad x = \boxed{\frac{1}{10}}.$$
We have  \[\#(\#(\#58))=\#(\#(.5(58)+1))=\#(\#(30))=\]\[\#(.5(30)+1)=\#(16)=(.5(16)+1)=\boxed{9}.\]
600 chocolate candies is $\frac{600}{25} = 24$ times as many candies as 25 candies
Multiplying the number of candies by 24 multiplies the cost by 24, so 600 candies costs $24\cdot 6 = \boxed{144}$ dollars.
We begin by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation and adding $-m-2x$ to both sides
We get $x^2+3x+(4-m)=0$
For this quadratic to have exactly one real root, the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ must be equal to $0$
Thus, we require $9-4(4-m) = 0$
Solving, we get that $m=\boxed{\frac{7}{4}}$.
We can find $x$ by adding twice the first equation to five times the second
From \begin{align*}
2(3x-5y)+5(7x+2y)&=6x+35x\\&=41x,
\end{align*}and \begin{align*}
2(3x-5y)+5(7x+2y)&=2(-1.5)+5(4.7)\\&=-3+23.5\\&=20.5,
\end{align*}we find that $41x = 20.5$, or $x=0.5.$
Substituting into the second equation, we can find $y:$ \begin{align*}
7x+2y&=4.7 \\ \implies y&=\frac{1}{2}(4.7-7x)\\&=\frac{1}{2}(4.7-3.5)\\&=\frac{1}{2}(1.2)\\&=0.6.
\end{align*}Thus our answer is $\boxed{(0.5,0.6)}.$
We have $8^\frac13=2$, so $\log_82 = \boxed{\frac13}$.
We must find the distance between each pair of points.
The distance between $(2, 2)$ and $(6, 2)$ is 4, since these two points have the same $y$-coordinate.
The distance between $(2, 2)$ and $(5, 6)$ is $\sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = 5$.
The distance between $(5, 6)$ and $(6, 2)$ is $\sqrt{(6 - 5)^2 + (2 - 6)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 16} = \sqrt{17}$.
Out of 4, 5, and $\sqrt{17}$, 5 is the largest value
Thus, the longest side of the triangle has length $\boxed{5}$.
Lines that are parallel have the same slope
In this case, $AB$ has a slope of $(0 - (-4))/(-4 - 0) = -1.$ This now must be the slope for $XY$
Now we can use the equation $y_2 - y_1 = m(x_2 - x_1)$ to find the value of $k$
Plugging in the coordinates for $Y$ and $X$ we find that $k - 8 = -1(14 - 0)$, thus $k = -14 + 8 = -6$
We also could see that from $(0, 8)$ to $(14, k)$ we are moving 14 units right, so we also must move 14 units down to get a slope of $-14/14 = -1$
Moving 14 units down from $(0, 8)$ lands us at $(0, 8 - 14)$ or $(0, -6)$, so $k = \boxed{-6}$.
Factoring, we find that $x^2 + 13x + 30 = (x + 3)(x + 10)$ and $x^2 + 5x - 50 = (x + 10)(x - 5)$
We can see that $b = 10$, therefore $a = 3$ and $c = 5$, and $a + b + c = \boxed{18}.$
Since the denominator involves cube roots, we can't just multiply by a conjugate
Instead we use the identity $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$
Letting $a = \sqrt[3]{3}$ and $b = \sqrt[3]{2}$, we have \[
\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{3} - \sqrt[3]{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{3} - \sqrt[3]{2}} \cdot \frac{(\sqrt[3]{3})^2 + \sqrt[3]{3} \sqrt[3]{2} + (\sqrt[3]{2})^2}{(\sqrt[3]{3})^2 + \sqrt[3]{3} \sqrt[3]{2} + (\sqrt[3]{2})^2}.
\]The denominator simplifies by the above identity to $(\sqrt[3]{3})^3 - (\sqrt[3]{2})^3 = 1$, so we are left with $\sqrt[3]{9} + \sqrt[3]{6} + \sqrt[3]{4}$
Matching the form given in the problem, $D = 1$ and $A = 9$, $B = 6$, $C = 4$ (in some order), so $A+B+C+D = \boxed{20}$.
For every point $(x,y)$ on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we know $(2-x,y)$ is also on the graph of $y=f(x)$.
We have $x = 1+(x-1)$ and $2-x = 1-(x-1)$, so the geometric transformation which takes $(x,y)$ to $(2-x,y)$ is reflection across the vertical line $\boxed{x=1}$.
Let there be $B$ boys and $G$ girls
Since every member is either a boy or a girl, $B+G=26$
Also, we have $\frac{1}{2}G+B=16$
Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have:
$\frac{1}{2}G=26-16=10\implies G=20$.
Thus there are $\boxed{20}$ girls on the chess team.
When we factor $3x^2 + nx + 72$, our two factors are of the form $(3x + A)(x+B)$, where $A$ and $B$ are integers
We must have $AB = 72$, and we want $3B +A$ to be as large as possible (because $3B+A$ is the coefficient of $x$ when $(3x+A)(x+B)$ is expanded)
We make $3B + A$ as large as possible by letting $B=72$ and $A=1$; any other possibility reduces $3B$ much more than $A$ increases
Therefore, the largest possible value of $n$ is $3B+A = 3(72) +1 =\boxed{217}$.
In order to determine the degree of a polynomial, we need to know the largest exponent of the variable in the polynomial
When we multiply out the expression above, the term with the largest exponent results from the product of the terms with the largest exponents within each multiplied quantity
These terms are $ax^7$, $x^3$, and $x$
Taking the product of all of these terms $ax^7\cdot x^3\cdot x=ax^{11}$, we find that the largest exponent is $\boxed{11}$.
The degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 1, and the only way that $g(x)$ can cancel the term of $-7x^4$ in $f(x)$ is if $g(x)$ contains the term $7x^4$
Therefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is $\boxed{4}$.
Let $x,y$ be the larger and smaller numbers, respectively
We have $x+y=30$ and $x-y=4$
Thus: $x=\frac{1}{2}((x+y)+(x-y))=\frac{1}{2}(30+4)=\boxed{17}$.
The given expression can be rewritten as $2x+3x^2+1-6+2x+3x^2$
Combining like terms, this last expression is equal to $(2x+2x)+(3x^2+3x^2)+(1-6)=\boxed{6x^2+4x-5}$.
The common difference is $1 - 2/3 = 1/3$, so the eighth term is $\frac{2}{3}+7\cdot\frac{1}{3}=\boxed{3}$.
Expanding the desired expression, we get $(2a-3)(4b-6)=8ab-12a-12b+18=8ab-12(a+b)+18$
This implies that we need the sum and product of the roots of the given equation, which are $-6/2=-3$ and $-14/2=-7$, respectively
Thus, the desired expression equals $(8\cdot -7) - (12 \cdot -3) + 18 = \boxed{-2}$.
Setting $y$ to 56, we find the following: \begin{align*}
56& = -16t^2 + 60t\\
0 & = -16t^2 + 60t - 56\\
& = 16t^2 - 60t + 56\\
& = 4t^2 - 15t + 14\\
& = (t - 2)(4t - 7)
\end{align*}Our possible values for $t$ are $\frac{7}{4} = 1.75$ or $2.$ Of these, we choose the smaller $t$, or $\boxed{1.75}.$
Let the $x$-coordinates of the vertices be $a,b,c$
Then the $x$-coordinates of the midpoints of the sides are $\frac{a+b}2,\frac{a+c}2,\frac{b+c}2$
The sum of these equals $\frac{2a+2b+2c}2=a+b+c$
Thus the desired answer is $\boxed{10}$.
Let the common ratio of the geometric sequence be $r$
We have the equations $20\cdot r = a$ and $a \cdot r = \frac{5}{4}$
In the first equation, we solve for $r$ to get $r=\frac{a}{20}$, and substitute this into the second equation to eliminate $r$, resulting in $a \cdot \frac{a}{20} = \frac{5}{4}$, or $a = \boxed{5}$.
We can rewrite $z^2=12z-7$ as $z^2-12z+7=0$
Because the sum of the roots of a quadratic is $\dfrac{-b}{a}$, we know that the sum of all values of $z$ such that $z^2-12z+7=0$ is $\dfrac{-(-12)}{1}=\boxed{12}$.
By the distributive property, this is equivalent to: $$x^2(x^2+2x+2)-2x(x^2+2x+2)+2(x^2+2x+2)$$Now, we can distribute in each of the above, and group like terms: $$x^4+2x^3+2x^2-2x^3-4x^2-4x+2x^2+4x+4$$$$\boxed{x^4+4}$$
We know that $5\star x = 5x+2x-5=37$
Combining like terms and adding $5$ to both sides, we have $7x=42$
Dividing by $7$ on both sides, we see that $x=\boxed{6}$.
Let $r$ be the common ratio of the geometric sequence
Then, the eighth term of the sequence is equal to $11r^3$, and the eleventh term of the sequence is equal to $11r^6 = 5$
From the second equation, it follows that $r^6 = \frac{5}{11} \Longrightarrow r^3 = \sqrt{\frac{5}{11}}$
Thus, $11r^3 = 11 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{5}{11}} = \sqrt{\frac{11^2 \cdot 5}{11}} = \boxed{\sqrt{55}}$.
Alternatively, since the eighth term is the middle term between the fifth term and the eleventh term, it follows that the eighth term is the geometric mean of the fifth and eleventh terms.
The sum of a set of integers is the product of the mean of the integers and the number of integers, and the median of a set of consecutive integers is the same as the mean
So the median must be $7^5/49=7^3$, or $\boxed{343}$.
If a point is on the $x$-axis, its $y$-coordinate is 0
Therefore, we substitute $y=0$ into the equation for the line to find $x=12/(-4)=-3$
Therefore, the coordinates of the $x$-intercept are $\boxed{(-3,0)}$.
Since he derived equal utility from both days, we have $$t (8 - t) = (2 - t)(t + 3),$$so $$8t - t^2 = -t^2 -t + 6.$$Simplifying gives $t = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
The slope of $y = 2x + 5$ is 2, which means the slope of any line perpendicular to it is $-\frac 12$
Using the point-slope equation for a line we can find the equation of the second line to be $y - 5 = -\frac 12 (x - 5)$
To find the intersection of this with the first line, we plug $y = 2x + 5$ into the second equation to get $2x + 5 - 5 = - \frac 12 (x - 5) \Rightarrow \frac {5}2 x = \frac 52 \Rightarrow x = 1$
Therefore $y = 2\cdot 1 + 5 = 7$ making the intersection at $\boxed{(1, 7)}$.
We see that we can rewrite the left side of the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35$ as $(2x - 7)(4x - 5)$, so we have $(2x - 7)(4x - 5) = 0$
Thus, solving the equations $2x - 7 = 0$ and $4x - 5 = 0$ gives us $x = 3.5$ and $x = 1.25$ as our solutions
Since $1.25 < 3.5$, our final answer is $x = \boxed{1.25}$.
If $1<2x<2$, then, dividing all the expressions in these inequalities by $2$, we have $\frac{1}{2}<x<1$.
If $1<3x<2$, then, dividing all the expressions by $3$, we have $\frac{1}{3}<x<\frac{2}{3}$.
Given that $x$ satisfies both inequalities, we must have $\frac{1}{2}<x<\frac{2}{3}$
In interval notation, the set of common solutions is $\boxed{\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3}\right)}$.
Kevin hops $1/3$ of the remaining distance with every hop
His first hop takes $1/3$ closer
For his second hop, he has $2/3$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)(1/3)$
For his third hop, he has $(2/3)^2$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)^2(1/3)$
In general, Kevin hops forward $(2/3)^{k-1}(1/3)$ on his $k$th hop
We want to find how far he has hopped after five hops
This is a finite geometric series with first term $1/3$, common ratio $2/3$, and five terms
Thus, Kevin has hopped $\frac{\frac{1}{3}\left(1-\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5\right)}{1-\frac{2}{3}} = \boxed{\frac{211}{243}}$.
The total cost of the peanut butter and jam is $N(4B+5J) = 253$ cents, so $N$ and $4B + 5J$ are factors of $253 =
11\cdot23$
Because $N>1$, the possible values of $N$ are 11, 23, and 253
If $N=253$, then $4B+5J = 1$, which is impossible since $B$ and $J$ are positive integers
If $N=23$, then $4B + 5J = 11$, which also has no solutions in positive integers
Hence $N = 11$ and $4B+5J=23$, which has the unique positive integer solution $B=2$ and $J=3$
So the cost of the jam is $11(3)(5\text{ cents})=\boxed{\$1.65}$.
Since $E$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$, it has coordinates $(\frac{1}{2}(8+0),\frac{1}{2}(0+0))=(4,0)$.
The line passing through the points $A$ and $E$ has slope $\frac{6-0}{0-4}=-\frac{3}{2}$; the $y$-intercept of this line is the $y$-coordinate of point $A$, or 6.
Therefore, the equation of the line passing through points $A$ and $E$ is $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+6$.
Point $F$ is the intersection point of the lines with equation $y=-\frac{3}{8}x+3$ and $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+6$.
To find the coordinates of point $F$ we solve the system of equations by equating $y$:
\begin{align*}
-\tfrac{3}{8}x+3&=-\tfrac{3}{2}x+6\\
8(-\tfrac{3}{8}x+3)&=8(-\tfrac{3}{2}x+6)\\
-3x+24&=-12x+48\\
9x&=24
\end{align*}Thus the $x$-coordinate of point $F$ is $x=\frac{8}{3}$; it follows that $y=-\frac{3}{2}\times \frac{8}{3}+6=2$
Hence $F=(\frac{8}{3},2)$ and sum of its coordinates are $\frac{8}{3} + 2 = \frac{8}{3}+\frac{6}{3}=\boxed{\frac{14}{3}}$.
First we have \[
(1 \star 2) = \frac{1 + 2}{1 - 2} = -3.
\]Then \[
((1 \star 2) \star 4) = (-3 \star 4) = \frac{-3 + 4}{-3 - 4} = \boxed{-\frac{1}{7}}.
Let's name the two numbers $a$ and $b.$ We want the probability that $ab>a+b,$ or $(a-1)(b-1)>1$ using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick
This inequality is satisfied if and only if $a\neq 1$ or $b\neq 1$ or $a \neq 2 \neq b$
There are a total of $16$ combinations such that $a \neq 1$ and $b \neq 1$
Then, we subtract one to account for $(2,2)$, which yields $15$ total combinations out of a total of 25, for a probability of $\boxed{\frac{3}{5}}$
We have that $A + B + C + D = 36$
Substituting everything in terms of $C$, we find that $(2C - 2) + (2C + 2) + C + (4C) = 36$, which means that $C = 4$
Thus $A = 6$, $B = 10$, and $D = 16$
Therefore our desired answer is $6\cdot 10\cdot 16\cdot 4 = \boxed{3840}$.
Substituting $\triangle + q = 59$ into the second equation gives $59 + q = 106$, so $q= 106-59 = 47$
Substituting $q=47$ into $\triangle + q =59$ gives $\triangle + 47 = 59$, so $\triangle = \boxed{12}$.
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms
The number of integers from 80 to 90 is $90 - 80 + 1 = 11$, so the sum is $(80 + 90)/2 \cdot 11 = \boxed{935}$.
We are given that $N^2 + N = 6$
Rearranging gives $N^2 + N - 6 =0$, and factoring the quadratic on the left gives $(N+3)(N-2) = 0$
The only negative solution to this equation is $N = \boxed{-3}$.
The integer is $\boxed{1}$, since $1^2=1<2$.
The common ratio of this sequence is $-1$
The first few terms will be: $$6,-6,6,-6,...$$All even numbered terms have value $-6$, and all odd numbered terms have value $6$
Since 205 is odd, its value will be $\boxed{6}$.
We factor the quadratic, getting $(b-5)(2-b) \ge 0$
The expression is equal to $0$ when $b=5 \text{ or } 2$
When $b \le 2$ or $b \ge 5$, the quadratic is negative
When $2 \le b \le 5$, the quadratic is non-negative
Therefore, the greatest value of $b$ for which $(b-5)(2-b)\ge 0$ is $b=\boxed{5}$.
The number of bacteria is multiplied by 2 at the end of each day, so the number of bacteria at the end of day $n$ is $3\cdot2^n$
We want $3\cdot2^n > 100$, or $2^n > 33\frac{1}{3}$
The smallest $n$ for which this happens is $n = \boxed{6}$.
Observe that $7<\sqrt{63}<8$, since $\sqrt{49}<\sqrt{63}<\sqrt{64}$
Therefore, the largest integer that is less than $\sqrt{63}$ is $\boxed{7}$.
The slope of the line through $(0,3)$ and $(-8,0)$ is $(0-3)/(-8-0) = 3/8$
If $(t,5)$ is also on this line, then the slope of  the line through $(t,5)$ and $(0,3)$ must also be $3/8$
Therefore, we must have \[\frac{3-5}{0-t} = \frac{3}{8} \implies \frac{2}{t} = \frac{3}{8} \implies (2)(8) = 3(t) \implies t = \boxed{\frac{16}{3}}.\]
We apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and note that if we subtract 12 from both sides, then the left side can be factored
Thus, $$ab - 3a + 4b -12 = 125 \rightarrow (a+4)(b-3) = 125$$Since $a,b$ are positive integers, then $a+4, b-3$ must be a pair of factors of $125= 5^3$, so $(a+4,b-3)$ must be among  $$(1,125), (5,25), (25,5),(125,1).$$Thus, $(a,b)$ must be among  $$(-3,128), (1,28), (21,8), (121,4).$$Ruling out the first solution on account of the negative value for $a$, we find that the minimal value of $|a-b|$ among the remaining three is $|21-8|=\boxed{13}$.
$7@4=7\cdot4-2\cdot7=14$ and $4@7=4\cdot7-2\cdot4=20$, so $(7@4)-(4@7)=14-20=\boxed{-6}$
Another way to solve this problem is to realize that the expression $(7@4)-(4@7)$ is of the form $(x@y)-(y@x)=xy-2x-yx+2y=-2x+2y$, so the expression is just equal to $-2\cdot7+2\cdot4=\boxed{-6}$.
Adding real parts and imaginary parts separately, we have $(2-(-4)+0+2)+(1+0-1+4)i=\boxed{8+4i}$.
Cross-multiplication gives  \[x+4=3x-6.\]Simplifying this expression tells us $2x=10$ or  \[x=\boxed{5}.\]
We can factor $x$ out of the numerator so that we're left with $$\frac{x(x^2-2x-8)}{x+2}=\frac{x(x-4)(x+2)}{x+2}$$After canceling out the $x+2$ from the numerator and denominator, we have $x(x-4)=5$
Solving for the roots of a quadratic equation, we have $x^2-4x-5=0$, which gives us $(x-5)(x+1)=0$ and $x=5$ or $x=-1$
The sum of these values is $\boxed{4}$, which is our answer.
Alternatively, since the sum of the solutions for a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $-b/a$, the sum of the zeros of the quadratic $x^2-4x-5$ is $4/1=\boxed{4}$.
The equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-x+y^2-3y=6.5$
Completing the square and writing decimals as fractions, this can further be rewritten as $\left( x - \dfrac{1}{2} \right)^2 - \dfrac{1}{4} + \left( y - \dfrac{3}{2} \right)^2 - \dfrac{9}{4}=\dfrac{13}{2}$
Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $\left( x - \dfrac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( y - \dfrac{3}{2} \right)^2 = \dfrac{10}{4}+\dfrac{13}{2}=\dfrac{18}{2}=9$, which is the equation of a circle with center $\left( \dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{3}{2} \right)$ and radius $\boxed{3}$.
If we let our three numbers be $x$, $y$, and $z$, we have that $x+y=29$, $y+z=46$, and $z+x=53$
Adding these three equations together, we get that $(x+y)+(y+z)+(z+x)=29+46+53$, so $2x+2y+2z=128$
If we then divide both sides of this equation by $2$, we are left with the equation $x+y+z=64$
Therefore, the sum of the three numbers must equal $\boxed{64}$.
We have $$
I = \frac{V}{Z} = \frac{1-i}{1+3i}.
$$ Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we get \begin{align*}
I &= \frac{1-i}{1+3i} \cdot \frac{1-3i}{1-3i}\\
& = \frac{1(1) + 1(-3i) - i(1) - i(-3i)}{1(1) + 1(-3i) + 3i(1) + 3i(-3i)}\\
& = \frac{-2-4i}{10}\\
& = \boxed{ -\frac{1}{5} - \frac{2}{5}i }.
\end{align*}
Since $f(x)$ has degree $2$, we know it is of the form $ax^2+bx+c$
A monic polynomial is one whose leading coefficient is $1$, so $a=1$
Since $f(0)=4$, we know $1(0)^2+b(0)+c=4$, so $c=4$
Since $f(1)=10$, we know $1(1)^2+b(1)+4=10$, so $b+5=10$ and $b=5$
Thus $f(x)=\boxed{x^2+5x+4}$.
$g(2)=2+1=3$
$$f(1+g(2))=f(4)=2(4)-3=\boxed{5}$$
Point B has coordinates $(x,4)$
We know the slope of $AB$ is $\frac{2}{3}$, so we know that: $\frac{4-0}{x-0} = \frac{2}{3}$, thus, $x = 6$, and the sum of the coordinates of point B is $\boxed{10}$.
Square both sides of the equation to obtain \[
(5+x)+2\sqrt{5+x}\sqrt{20-x}+(20-x)=49.
\]This equation simplifies to \[
2\sqrt{(5+x)(20-x)}=24,
\]so $(5+x)(20-x)=(24/2)^2=\boxed{144}$.
We can find the slope and the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept quickly by putting the equation in slope-intercept form
Solving the equation $3x+5y=20$ for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = -\frac{3}{5}x +4$
So, the $y$-intercept is $\boxed{(0,4)}$.
Since $\sqrt{9}<\sqrt{12}<\sqrt{16}$, or, equivalently $3<\sqrt{12}<4$, the greatest integer less than or equal to $\sqrt{12}$ must be $3$
Thus, $\lfloor{\sqrt{12}}\rfloor^2=3^2=\boxed{9}$.
We have the equation $\frac{3+x}{5+x}=\frac{1+x}{2+x}$
Simplifying, we get \begin{align*}
(3+x)(2+x)&=(5+x)(1+x)\\
6+5x+x^2&=5+6x+x^2\\
x&=\boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
We have  \[81^{3/4} = (3^4)^{3/4} = 3^{4\cdot (3/4)} = 3^3 = \boxed{27}.\]
We can find the slope and the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept quickly by putting the equation in slope-intercept form
Solving the equation $3x+5y=20$ for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = -\frac{3}{5}x +4$
So, the slope is $\boxed{-\frac{3}{5}}$.
We can factor out a $2$ from both terms, giving $(2)(x^2-4)$
Then we can factor the second expression because it is a difference of squares, giving $\boxed{(2) (x+2) (x-2)}$.
We begin by finding $f(-2)$ and $f(2)$
Since $-2<0$, we have that $f(-2)=(-2)^2-2=2$ and since $2 \geq 0$, we have that $f(2)=2(2)-20=-16$
Now we can substitute these values back into our equation $f(-2)+f(2)+f(a)=0$ to get $2 + (-16) + f(a) = 0$, so $f(a)=14$.
Our next step is to find all values of $a$ such that $f(a)=14$
Our first equation $f(a)=a^2-2=14$ yields that $a= \pm 4$, but $a<0$ so $a=-4$ is the only solution
Our second equation $f(a)=2a-20=14$ yields that $a=17$ which is indeed greater than or equal to $0$
Thus, our two possible values of $a$ are $-4$ and $17$ and their positive difference is $17 - (-4) = \boxed{21}$.
If $9x^2 +24x + a$ is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $3x +b$ for some number $b$, because $(3x)^2 = 9x^2$
So, we compare $(3x+b)^2$ to $9x^2 + 24x + a$
Expanding $(3x+b)^2$ gives \[(3x+b)^2 = (3x)^2 + 2(3x)(b) + b^2 = 9x^2 + 6bx + b^2.\]Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $9x^2+24x+a$, we have $6bx=24x$, so $b=4$
Equating the constant term of $9x^2 + 6bx + b^2$ to that of $9x^2 + 24x+a$ gives us $a=b^2 = \boxed{16}$.
We can write $16$ as $2^4$
Therefore, we can write our equation as $2^8 = 2^{4 \cdot x}$
Solving, we get that $x = \boxed{2}$.
The amount in quarters is $20\times25$ cents and the total amount is $50\times10+20\times25$ cents
The percent of the value in quarters is $$\frac{20\times25}{50\times10+20\times25}=\frac{500}{500+500}=\frac{500}{1000}=\boxed{50\%}.$$
We apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and note that if we subtract $30$ from both sides, then the left side can be factored
Thus, $$ab - 6a + 5b -30 = 343 \rightarrow (a+5)(b-6) = 343$$Since $a,b$ are positive integers, then $a+5, b-6$ must be a pair of factors of $343 = 7^3$, which are given by $\{a+5,b-6\} = \{1,343\}, \{7,49\}, \{49,7\}$, or $\{343,1\}$
Thus, $\{a,b\} = \{-4,349\}, \{2,55\}, \{44,13\}$, or $\{338,7\}$
Therefore the minimal value of $|a-b|$ is $|44-13|=\boxed{31}$.
Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we have \begin{align*}
\frac{1-i}{2+3i} \cdot \frac{2-3i}{2-3i} &= \frac{1(2) + 1(-3i) - i(2) - i(-3i)}{2(2) + 2(-3i) + 3i(2) -3i(3i)}\\
& = \frac{-1-5i}{13} \\
&= \boxed{-\frac{1}{13} - \frac{5}{13}i}.
\end{align*}
First, we solve for $b = g(a)$.
\begin{align*}
f(g(a)) &= 8 \\
f(b) &= 8 \\
b^2 + 8 &= 8 \\
b^2 &= 0 \\
\end{align*}
Therefore, $b = g(a) = 0.$ Now, we solve for $a$ using $g(a) = a^2 - 4 = 0.$ From this, $a = \pm 2.$ Since we are given that $a > 0$, our answer is $a = \boxed{2}.$
If we multiply the first equation, the third equation, and the reciprocal of the second equation, we get \[\frac{m}{n}\cdot\frac{p}{q}\cdot \frac{n}{p} = 15\cdot \frac{1}{10}\cdot\frac{1}{3}\Rightarrow \frac{m}{q}= \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.\]
Completing the square in each equation results in the equations $y=(x - 1)^2 + 2 $ and $y=(x + 2)^2 + 6$
Thus, $A = (1, 2)$ and $B = (-2, 6)$
We can then find the distance between $A$ and $B$ to be $\sqrt{(1-(-2))^2 + (2-6)^2} = \sqrt{9+16} =\boxed{5}$.
We have
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{r} &= \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{36} + 2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{4 \cdot 9} + \frac{1}{4 \cdot 36} + \frac{1}{9 \cdot 36}} \\
&= \frac{9}{36} + \frac{4}{36} + \frac{1}{36} + 2 \sqrt{\frac{36}{4 \cdot 9 \cdot 36} + \frac{9}{4 \cdot 9 \cdot 36} + \frac{4}{4 \cdot 9 \cdot 36}} \\
&= \frac{14}{36} + 2 \sqrt{\frac{49}{4 \cdot 9 \cdot 36}} \\
&= \frac{7}{9},
\end{align*}so $r = \boxed{\frac{9}{7}}.$
Let the numbers be $x$ and $y$
We have $x+y=31$ and $x-y=3$
Summing these equations, we get $2x=34$, or $x=17$
Since $x-y$ is positive, this is the larger number, so the answer is $\boxed{17}$.
Evaluating gives  \[f(2)=2(2)^4+(2)^3+(2)^2-3(2)+r=32+8+4-6+r=38+r.\]This is equal to 0 when $r=\boxed{-38}$.
First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lfloor x \rfloor + x$ is nonpositive
Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{1}{3}$
We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{1}{3}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Therefore, we can write $\lfloor x \rfloor + x$ as $n+n+\dfrac{1}{3}=\dfrac{13}{3}$
Solving, we get $n=2$
Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $2+\dfrac{1}{3}=\boxed{\dfrac{7}{3}}$.
We use the distance formula on each pair of points.
From $A$ to $B$: $\sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (8-2)^2} = 6$
From $B$ to $C$: $\sqrt{(5-1)^2 + (5-8)^2} = \sqrt{16+9} = \sqrt{25} = 5$
From $C$ to $A$: $\sqrt{(5-1)^2 + (5-2)^2} = \sqrt{16+9} = \sqrt{25} = 5$
Adding the three side lengths of the triangle together, we get $6+5+5=\boxed{16}$.
Recall that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of roots is equal to $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is equal to $c/a$.
So, we can write the set of equations \begin{align*}
3 - \frac{4}{3} &= \frac{5}{k} \\
-4 &= \frac{-12}{k}
\end{align*}
The second equation tells us immediately that $k = \boxed{3}$.
$-\frac{15}{4} = -3\frac{3}{4}$
The greatest integer less than $-3\frac{3}{4}$ is $\boxed{-4}$.
This problem is an application of the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
Using the quadratic formula, we find that $x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 +32}}{4} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{4}$
Since $4$ and $57$ are relatively prime, $n = \boxed{57}$.
Suppose $N=10a+b$
Then $10a+b=ab+(a+b)$
It follows that $9a=ab$, which implies that $b=9$, since $a \neq 0$
So the units digit of $N$ is $\boxed{9}$.
The point $(3,5)$ is on the graph
This means that $E(3)=\boxed{5}$.
Reading from the graph we see that $f(3)=6$
Therefore Larry writes 6 on his second finger
Since $f(6)=5$ we see that Larry writes 5 on this third finger
If we apply $f$ again, we see that Larry writes  \[f(5)=4\] on the fourth finger
After this Larry writes $f(4)=3$ on his fifth finger
Now the process repeats!
Since the first finger has 3 on it and the fifth finger also gets a 3 (4 turns later), the ninth finger will also get labeled as 3
Therefore Larry writes $f(3)=\boxed{6}$ on his tenth finger.
Let $x= \log_{\sqrt{6}}(216\sqrt{6})$
Putting this in exponential notation gives $(\sqrt{6})^x = 216\sqrt{6}$
Writing both sides with $6$ as the base gives us $6^{\frac{x}{2}} = 6^3\cdot 6^{\frac{1}{2}} = 6^{\frac{7}{2}}$, so $x/2=7/2$
Therefore, $x=\boxed{7}$.
We note that $(2x)^2 + 2\cdot 37 \cdot 2x + 37^2 = (2x + 37)^2$
In order for this expression to be a multiple of 47, $2x + 37$ must be a multiple of 47
Since we want the least positive value of $x$, we will want $2x + 37 = 47$
It follows that $x = \boxed{5}$.
The terms of the arithmetic progression are 9, $9+d$, and $9+2d$ for some real number $d$
The terms of the geometric progression are 9, $11+d$, and $29+2d$
Therefore \[
(11+d)^{2} = 9(29+2d) \quad\text{so}\quad d^{2}+4d-140 = 0.
\]Thus $d=10$ or $d=-14$
The corresponding geometric progressions are $9, 21, 49$ and $9, -3, 1,$ so the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is $\boxed{1}$.
First we have to solve for $k$ where $3\sqrt{2}=k\cdot81^{\frac{1}{4}}$
Since $81^{\frac{1}{4}}=3$, we have $3\sqrt{2}=k\cdot3$, so $k = \sqrt{2}$.
When $x=4$, we have$$y=k\cdot4^{\frac{1}{4}}=k\cdot\sqrt{2}.$$Since $k=\sqrt{2}$, we have $$y=\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{2}=\boxed{2}.$$
$(r^2 + 3r - 2) - (r^2 + 7r - 5) = r^2 + 3r -2 -r^2 -7r +5 = r^2 - r^2 +3r-7r -2+5 = \boxed{-4r+3}$.
Each inch of the 4.75-inch line segment represents 800 feet, so the whole line segment represents $4.75\times800=\frac{19}{4}\cdot800=19\cdot200=\boxed{3800}$ feet.
Let the dimensions of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$
We are given $2l+2w=30$, which implies $l+w=15$
We want to maximize the product $lw$
We make this product maximal for a fixed sum when $l$ and $w$ are as close as possible
Since $l$ and $w$ are integers, they must be 7 and 8, which gives us a product of $\boxed{56}$.
Below is proof that we want $l$ and $w$ to be as close as possible.
Since $l+w=15$, we have $w=15-l$
The area of the rectangle is $lw=l(15-l)$
Completing the square gives \begin{align*}
&l(15-l) = 15l-l^2 = -(l^2 - 15l) \\
&\qquad= -\left(l^2 - 15l +\left(\frac{15}{2}\right)^2\right) + \left(\frac{15}{2}\right)^2\\
&\qquad= -\left(l-\frac{15}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{15}{2}\right)^2.\end{align*} Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $\frac{225}{4}$ minus the squared quantity $\left(l-\frac{15}{2}\right)^2 $
So, we need $l$ to be as close to $\frac{15}{2}$ as possible to make this area as great as possible
Letting $l=7$ or $l=8$ gives us our maximum area, which is $8\cdot 7 = \boxed{56}$.
Note that we might also have figured out the value of $l$ that gives us the maximum of $l(15-l)$ by considering the graph of $y=x(15-x)$
The graph of this equation is a parabola with $x$-intercepts $(0,0)$ and $(15,0)$
The axis of symmetry is mid-way between these intercepts, so it is at $x=7.5$, which means the vertex is on the line $x=7.5$
The parabola goes downward from the vertex both to the left and right, so the highest possible point on the graph that has an integer coordinate for $x$ must have $x=7$ or $x=8$ as the $x$-coordinate
So, the rectangle's length must be 7 or 8, as before.
import graph; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));

The key to this problem is noticing that $109^2 - 100^2$ factors into $(109+100)(109-100)$
So, our fraction becomes $\frac{(109+100)(109-100)}{9} = \frac{209 \cdot 9}{9}$, which simplifies to $\boxed{209}$.
Cross-multiplication gives  \[3x^2+2x+1=(x-1)(3x+1)=3x^2-2x-1.\]Therefore \[4x=-2\]and $x=\boxed{-\frac{1}2}$.
The pattern suggests that for a number with $n$ nines, that number squared has $n-1$ zeros
Thus, $99,\!999,\!999^2$ should have $8-1=7$ zeros
To prove this, we note that $99,\!999,\!999=10^8-1$, so $99,\!999,\!999^2=(10^8-1)^2=10^{16}-2\cdot10^8+1$
Consider this last expression one term at a time
The first term, $10^{16}$, creates a number with 16 zeros and a one at the front
The second term, $2\cdot10^8$, is a number with 8 zeros and a two at the front
The latter number is subtracted from the former one, so what is left is a string of 7 nines, then an eight, then 8 zeros
Finally, the last term changes the last zero of the number to a one
Thus, we are left with $\boxed{7}$ zeros.
$2(3-i) + i(2+i) = 6-2i +2i + i^2 = 6 -2i+2i -1 = (6-1) + (-2i+2i) = \boxed{5}$.
Adding together the real part and imaginary parts separately, we have $(1+2)+(3-4)i=\boxed{3-i}$.
After five years, at a six percent annual interest rate, the investment will have grown to $10000 \cdot 1.06^5 = \boxed{13382}$, to the nearest dollar.
Turning the division sign into multiplication and simplifying, we have  \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{x}+\frac{2}{x}\cdot\frac{x}{4}&=.75 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{2}&=.75\\
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{x}&=.25\\
\Rightarrow x&=\boxed{4}.
\end{align*}
First, we combine like terms in the expression: \begin{align*}
(15x^3+80x-5)&-(-4x^3+4x-5)\\
&=15x^3+80x-5+4x^3-4x+5\\
&=19x^3+76x.\end{align*}We can factor out a $19x$ from the expression, to get $$19x^3+76x=\boxed{19x(x^2+4)}.$$
The vertex of the parabola is $(-4,2)$, so the equation of the parabola is of the form \[x = a(y - 2)^2 - 4.\]The parabola passes through the point $(-2,4)$
Substituting these values into the equation above, we get \[-2 = a(4 - 2)^2 - 4.\]Solving for $a$, we find $a = 1/2$
Hence, the equation of the parabola is given by \[x = \frac{1}{2} (y - 2)^2 - 4 = \frac{1}{2} (y^2 - 4y + 4) - 4 = \frac{1}{2} y^2 - 2y - 2.\]The answer is $\boxed{-2}$.
Alternatively, the value of $x = ay^2 + by + c$ is $c$ when $y = 0$
The parabola passes through the point $(-2,0)$, so $c = \boxed{-2}$.
If $n$ is the second integer, then the first integer is $n-1$ and the third integer is $n+1$
The sum of the first and third integers is $2n$, so $n=118/2=\boxed{59}$.
Since $D$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AB},$ it has coordinates $$\left(\frac{1}{2}(0+0),\frac{1}{2}(0+6)\right)=(0,3).$$The line passing through $C$ and $D$ has slope $$\frac{3-0}{0-8}=-\frac{3}{8};$$the $y$-intercept of this line is the $y$-coordinate of point $D,$ or $3.$ Therefore, the equation of the line passing through points $C$ and $D$ is $$y=-\frac{3}{8}x+3;$$the sum of the slope and $y$-intercept is then $$-\frac{3}{8}+3=-\frac{3}{8}+\frac{24}{8}=\boxed{\frac{21}{8}}.$$
Knowing that $\lfloor x \rfloor \leq x < \lfloor x \rfloor + 1,$ we see that $\lfloor x \rfloor$ must be $8,$ since $8 \cdot 8 \leq 70 < 9 \cdot 9.$
Now we see that $\lfloor x \rfloor \cdot x = 8x = 70,$ so $x = \frac{70}{8} = \boxed{8.75}.$
We have $g(4) = 3\cdot 4 + 5= 17$, so $f(g(4)) = f(17) = 17 + 3 = 20$
We also have $f(4) = 4+3 = 7$, so $g(f(4)) = g(7)=3\cdot 7 + 5 = 26$
Therefore, $f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) = 20 - 26 = \boxed{-6}$.
A rectangle with fixed perimeter has minimal area when one dimension is as long as possible and the other is as short as possible
To see this, let $x$ be the shorter dimension and $y$ the area of the rectangle, and note that $y=x(50-x)$
The graph of $y=x(50-x)$ is a down-turned parabola with vertex at $(25,625)$, and thus is as small as possible when $x$ is as small as possible
Since $x$ is an integer, its minimum value is 1
Thus the relevant rectangle with minimum area is 1 by 49
Its area is $49\cdot 1=\boxed{49}$ square units.
$(-3-2i)-(1+4i)= -3 -2i -1 - 4i= \boxed{-4-6i}$.
We first evaluate $f(5) = 5 -t(5) = 5-\sqrt{5\cdot3+1}=1$
Thus $t(f(5))=t(1)=\sqrt{3\cdot1 + 1}=\boxed{2}$.
Rearranging the given equation, we get $5x^2+kx-4=0$
That means that the product of the roots of the equation is $-4/5$
If one of the roots of the equation is 2, then the other must be $(-4/5)/2=\boxed{-\frac{2}{5}}$.
The function $f(x) = ax + b$ is linear, so as $x$ varies over the interval $0 \le x \le 1$, $f(x) = ax + b$ takes on all values between $b$ and $a + b$ (inclusive)
Furthermore, $a < 0$, so $a + b < b$
Hence, the range of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{[a +b, b]}$.
Let's work with this problem in cents, not dollars, because the answer calls for a number in cents
So, Alice's three burgers and two sodas cost 320 cents and Bill's food costs 200 cents
Let a burger cost $b$ cents and a soda cost $s$ cents
We are trying to find the value of $b$
We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information
These equations are:
\begin{align*}
3b + 2s &= 320 \\
2b + s &= 200 \\
\end{align*}We are solving for $b$, so we want to eliminate $s$ from the equations above
Multiplying both sides of the second equation by 2, we get $4b+2s = 400$, or $2s = 400 - 4b$
Substituting this equation into the first equation above to eliminate $s$, we get that $3b + (400-4b) = 320$, or $b=80$
Thus, a burger costs $\boxed{80}$ cents.
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes
If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$
If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$
So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept
The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$
The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18
The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$.
Substituting in, we have $4-2i-2(3+2i)$
Expanding the last part, we have $4-2i-6-4i$; adding, we have $\boxed{-2-6i}$.
We can write the problem as the inequality $w(w+15)\ge100$
Distributing on the left-hand side, subtracting 100 from both sides, and factoring, we get \begin{align*}
w(w+15)&\ge100 \quad \Rightarrow \\
w^2+15w-100&\ge 0 \quad \Rightarrow \\
(w-5)(w+20)&\ge 0.
\end{align*} The roots are $w=5$ and $w=-20$
We can't have a width of -20 ft, so the smallest width possible while still having an area of at least 100 sq
ft is $\boxed{5}$ ft.
We multiply $(3+4i)(3+4i)=9+12i+12i-16=\boxed{-7+24i}$.
By the quadratic formula, the equation $5x^2+11x+c=0$ has solutions $$x = \frac{-(11)\pm\sqrt{(11)^2-4(5)(c)}}{2(5)} = \frac{-11\pm\sqrt{121-20c}}{10}.$$For these solutions to be rational, the quantity under the square root (i.e., the discriminant) must be a perfect square
So, we seek the possible (positive integer) values of $c$ for which $121-20c$ is a square
The possible nonnegative values for $121-20c$ are $101$, $81$, $61$, $41$, $21$, or $1$
The only squares in this list are $81$, coming from $c=2$, and $1$, coming from $c=6$
So the product of the two possible $c$ values is $2\cdot 6=\boxed{12}$.
We label the length $l$, the width $w$, and the height $h$
We are given that $l \cdot w \cdot h =4320$, thus we have that $2lw+2wh+2hl = 1704$ and $lw+wh+hl = 852.$ Also, $4l+4w+4h=208,$ so $l+w+h=52$.
We want to find what the volume will be if we increase all of the sides by an inch
So we have, \begin{align*}
(l+1)(w+1)(h+1)&=lwh+lh+wh+lw+w+l+h+1\\
&=4320+852+52+1\\
&=\boxed{5225 \text{ cubic inches}}.
\end{align*}
The desired area is the infinite series $\frac{4}{9}\left(1+\frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{9^2}+\cdots\right).$
Simplifying, we have $\frac{4}{9}\left( \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{9}}\right)=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
Simplify under the radical first: $3^5+3^5+3^5=3\cdot 3^5=3^6$, and the cube root of $3^6$ is $3^{6/3}=3^2=\boxed{9}$.
Let the values on one pair of opposite faces be $a$ and $d$; the second pair of faces, $b$ and $e$, and the third pair of faces, $c$ and $f$
There are eight vertices on the cube, so we find that the sum 1001 is equal to $$abc + aec + abf + aef + dbc + dec + dbf + def.$$ For any two faces adjacent at a vertex with $a$, the same two faces are adjacent to a vertex with $d$
Furthermore, any three adjacent faces must contain one of $a$ or $d$
Therefore, every term contains $a$ or $d$, and the expression is symmetric in $a$ and $d$
Considering the expression as a polynomial in $a$ (with the remaining variables fixed), we observe that $P(-d)=0$
Therefore, $a+d$ divides the given expression
Similarly, $b+e$ and $c+f$ divide the given expression as well
Therefore, $$abc + aec + abf + aef + dbc + dec + dbf + def = k(a+d)(b+e)(c+f).$$ Here, since both sides are of degree three in their variables, $k$ must be a constant, which is easily seen to be $1$.
It follows that $(a+d)(b+e)(c+f) = 1001 = 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$
Since each of the variables is positive, we have $a+d > 1, b+e > 1,$ and  $c+f > 1$
Thus $(a+d)+(b+e)+(c+f) = 7 + 11 + 13 = \boxed{31}$.
Substituting $f^{-1}(x)$ into our expression for $f$, we get \[f(f^{-1}(x))=\frac{16}{5+3f^{-1}(x)}.\]Since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f^{-1}$, we have \[x=\frac{16}{5+3f^{-1}(x)}.\]When $x=2$ this says \[2=\frac{16}{5+3f^{-1}(2)}.\]Solving for $f^{-1}(2)$, we find $f^{-1}(2) = 1$
Then $[f^{-1}(2)]^{-2} = 1^{-2} = \boxed{1}$.
We start by completing the square: \begin{align*}
x^2+11x-5&= x^2+11x +\left(\frac{11}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{11}{2}\right)^2 - 5\\ &= x^2 +11x+ \left(\frac{11}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{11}{2}\right)^2 - 5\\ &=\left(x+\frac{11}{2}\right)^2 -5 - \frac{121}{4}.\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is at least 0, we have $\left(x+\frac{11}{2}\right)^2\ge 0$, where $\left(x+\frac{11}{2}\right)^2 =0$ only if $x=-\frac{11}{2}$
Therefore, the expression is minimized when $x=\boxed{-\frac{11}{2}}.$
When using the distributive property, we add the product of 16 and $2x$ to the product of 16 and 5:
\begin{align*}
16(2x+5) &= 16\cdot 2x+16\cdot 5\\
&= \boxed{32x+80}
\end{align*}
We have: $3*2=3^2+3\cdot 2-2^2=9+6-4=\boxed{11}$.
We know that $$\left(x+\frac{1}{x}\right)^3=x^3+3(x^2)\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)+3(x)\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^3=x^3+\frac{1}{x^3}+3\left(x+\frac{1}{x}\right).$$Let $x+\frac{1}{x}=a$
Then our equation is $a^3=x^3+\frac{1}{x^3}+3a$
We know $x^3+\frac{1}{x^3}=52$, so we have $a^3=52+3a$ or $a^3-3a-52=0$
By the rational root theorem, the possible roots of this polynomial equation are the divisors of 52 as well as their negatives: $\pm1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 13, \pm 26, \pm 52$
Both $\pm1$ and $\pm2$ are easy to check by substitution
For $\pm 4$ we can use synthetic division (or substitution), and we find that that $a=4$ is a root
(We could also see this by inspection by writing $a^3-3a=52$ and noting that $4$ works.)
Are there other solutions? Use synthetic division to divide:
\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
$4$&$1$&$0$&$-3$&$-52$\\
$$&$\downarrow$&$4$&$16$&$52$\\ \hline
$$&$1$&$4$&13$$&$0$
\end{tabular}
The quotient is $a^2+4a+13$, so $a^3-3a-52 = (a-4)(a^2+4a+13)$
The discriminant of $a^2+4a+13$ is $4^2-4(1)(13)=16-52=-36$, which is negative, so there are no other real solutions for $a$
If $x$ is real, $a$ must be real, so we conclude that there are no other values of $x+\frac{1}{x}$
Thus $x+\frac{1}{x}=a=\boxed{4}$.
Let one pair of parallel sides have length $x$ and the other pair of parallel sides have length $12-x$
This means that the perimeter of the rectangle is $x+x+12-x+12-x=24$ as the problem states
The area of this rectangle is $12x-x^2$
Completing the square results in $-(x-6)^2+36\le 36$ since $(x-6)^2\ge 0$, so the maximum area of $\boxed{36}$ is obtained when the rectangle is a square of side length 6 inches.
Dividing both sides of the equation $9x^2-18x-720=0$ by $9$, we have $$x^2-2x-80 = 0.$$The square which agrees with $x^2-2x-80$ except for the constant term is $(x-1)^2$, which is equal to $x^2-2x+1$ and thus to $(x^2-2x-80)+81$.
Therefore, by adding $81$ to each side, Marina rewrote the equation $x^2-2x-80 = 0$ as $$(x-1)^2 = 81.$$We have $r=-1$ and $s=\boxed{81}$.
We apply the order of operations
To see that this means to sum the denominator first, note that we can write the expression as \[1 + 2/\left(3 + \frac{4}{5}\right).\] So, we have \begin{align*}
1 + \frac{2}{3+\frac{4}{5}} &= 1 + \frac{2}{\frac{15}{5} + \frac{4}{5}}\\
&= 1 + \frac{2}{\frac{19}{5}} \\
&= 1 + 2\cdot\frac{5}{19} =1 + \frac{10}{19}=\frac{19}{19} + \frac{10}{19} = \boxed{\frac{29}{19}}.
\end{align*}
Cross-multiplying (which is the same as multiplying both sides by $r-2$ and by $r+1$) gives \[(r+3)(r+1) = (r-1)(r-2).\]Expanding the products on both sides gives  \[r^2 + 3r + r + 3 = r^2 -r - 2r + 2.\]which simplifies to $r^2 + 4r + 3 = r^2 - 3r + 2$
Subtracting $r^2$ from both sides and collecting terms gives $7r = -1$, so $r = \boxed{-\frac{1}{7}}$.
To get from the seventh term to the tenth term, we multiply the seventh term by 3 ($7\times3=21$)
So to get from the tenth term to the $13$th term, we multiply the tenth term by 3 since the ratio between terms is constant
The $13$th term is $21\times3=\boxed{63}$.
To be more specific, we can write the eighth term as $7r$, where $r$ is the common ratio of the geometric sequence
The ninth term is $7r^2$, the tenth term is $7r^3$, etc
If $7r^3=21$, then $r^3=3$
So $a_n=a_{n-3}r^3=3a_{n-3}$
We get the $13$th term with $3a_{10}=3\times21=\boxed{63}$.
Let the integers be $x$ and $y$, with $x>y$
We have the equations \begin{align*}
x-y&=6\\
xy&=112
\end{align*}Squaring the first equation, we get  \[(x-y)^2=6^2\Rightarrow x^2-2xy+y^2=36\]Multiplying the second equation by four, we get $4xy = 4\cdot112=448$
Adding these last two equations, we have \[x^2-2xy+y^2+4xy=36+448 \Rightarrow (x+y)^2=484 \Rightarrow x+y = 22\]In the last step, we take the positive square root because both $x$ and $y$ are given to be positive
The sum of the two integers is $\boxed{22}$.
Substitute 5 for $b$ in the expression defining $a*b$ to find that $a*5=2a-25$
Setting this equal to 9, we find  \begin{align*}
2a-25&=9 \implies \\
2a&=34 \implies \\
a&=\boxed{17}.
\end{align*}
Suppose the roots of the quadratic are given by $m$ and $n$ with $m\leq n$
Note that $$(x-m)(x-n) = x^2 - (m+n)x + mn = x^2 + ax + 8a,$$ and setting coefficients equal, it follows that  \begin{align*}
m + n &= -a \\
mn &= 8a
\end{align*} (This also follows directly from Vieta's formulas.) Adding $8$ times the first equation to the second gives us that $$8(m+n)+mn=0$$ Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick can now be applied by adding $64$ to both sides: $$mn + 8m + 8n + 64 = (m+8)(n+8) = 64.$$ It follows that $m+8$ and $n+8$ are divisors of $64$, whose pairs of divisors are given by $\pm \{(1,64),(2,32),(4,16)$ and $(8,8)\}$
Solving, we see that $(m,n)$ must be among the pairs  \begin{align*}
&(-7,56),(-6,24),(-4,8),(0,0),\\
&(-72,-9),(-40,-10),(-24,-12),(-16,-16).
\end{align*} Since $a=-(m+n)$ and each of these pairs gives a distinct value of $m+n$, each of these $8$ pairs gives a distinct value of $a$, so our answer is $\boxed{8}$.
Multiplying out the expression, we find that $(9x+2)(4x^2+3)=\boxed{36x^3+8x^2+27x+6}$.
All points on the line $x=-3$ are of the form $(-3,y)$, where $y$ is a real number
The distance from $(5,2)$ to $(-3,y)$ is $$\sqrt{(5-(-3))^2+(2-y)^2}$$ units
Setting this expression equal to 10, we find \begin{align*}
\sqrt{(5-(-3))^2+(2-y)^2}&= 10 \\
64+(2-y)^2&= 100 \\
(2-y)^2&= 36 \\
2-y&=\pm 6 \\
y=2\pm6.
\end{align*} The product of $2+6 = 8$ and $2-6 = -4$ is $\boxed{-32}$

The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is $2 + 4 + \dots + 40 = 2(1 + 2 + \dots + 20)$
For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $2(1 + 2 + \dots + 20) = 20 \cdot 21 = 420$.
The sum of the first 15 positive odd integers is $1 + 3 + \dots + 29$
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so this sum is equal to $(1 + 29)/2 \cdot 15 = 225$
The positive difference between these sums is $420 - 225 = \boxed{195}$.
Noticing that both 64 and 32 are powers of 2, we can rewrite the expression as $\left(2^6\right)^5=\left( 2^5 \right) ^x$
Simplifying, we get \begin{align*}
\left(2^6\right)^5&=\left( 2^5 \right) ^x \\
2^{6 \cdot 5} &= 2^{5 \cdot x} \\
2^{30} &= 2^{5x} \\
2^6&=2^x \\
2^{-6} &= 2^{-x}
\end{align*} Thus, $2^{-6}=\frac{1}{2^6}=\boxed{\frac{1}{64}}$.
For $f^{-1}(5)$, $f^{-1}(13)$, and $f^{-1}(1)$, we read from the table \[f(13)=5\quad\Rightarrow\quad f^{-1}(5)=13,\]\[f(2)=13\quad\Rightarrow\quad f^{-1}(13)=2,\quad \text{and}\]\[f(5)=1\quad\Rightarrow\quad f^{-1}(1)=5.\]Therefore,  \[f^{-1}\left(\frac{f^{-1}(5) +f^{-1}(13)}{f^{-1}(1)}\right)=f^{-1}\left(\frac{13+2}{5}\right)=f^{-1}(3)\]Because $f(1)=3$, $f^{-1}(3)=\boxed{1}$.
Expanding the squares, we have \begin{align*}
&(3^{1001}+4^{1002})^2-(3^{1001}-4^{1002})^2\\
&\qquad=3^{2002}+2\cdot3^{1001}\cdot4^{1002}+4^{2004}\\
&\qquad\qquad-3^{2002}+2\cdot3^{1001}\cdot4^{1002}-4^{2004}\\
&\qquad=4\cdot3^{1001}\cdot4^{1002}.
\end{align*}Since $4^{1002}=4\cdot4^{1001}$, we can rewrite the expression as  \[16\cdot3^{1001}\cdot4^{1001}=16\cdot12^{1001}.\]Thus, $k=\boxed{16}$.
We have $$(\sqrt[6]{4})^9 = (4^{1/6})^9 = 4^{\frac{1}{6}\cdot 9} = 4^{3/2} = (4^{1/2})^3 = 2^3 = \boxed{8}.$$
$5(3-i) + 3i(5-i) = 15-5i + 15i - 3i^2 = 15 +10i -3(-1) = \boxed{18+10i}$.
Simplify the two factors first
Factor $2^4$ from $576$ to get $36$, and since $36=6^2$, the fourth root of $576$ is $(2^\frac44)(6^\frac24)=2\sqrt{6}$
Because $6^2$ evenly divides $216$, the square root of $216$ is $(6^\frac22)(6^\frac12)=6\sqrt{6}$
Multiply those two quantities together to obtain $\boxed{72}$ as an answer.
The vertex form of a parabolic equation is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$
Since we are given that the vertex is at $(2,-4)$, we know that $h=2$ and $k=-4$
Plugging that into our equation gives $y=a(x-2)^2-4$
Now, substituting the other given point $(4,12)$ into the equation to solve for $a$, we have  \begin{align*}
12&=a(4-2)^2-4\\
16&=a(2)^2\\
16&=4a\\
\end{align*} So the equation for the graphed parabola is $y=4(x-2)^2-4$
The zeros of the quadratic occur when $y=0$, so plugging that value into the equation to solve for $x$, we have $0=4(x-2)^2-4 \Rightarrow (x-2)^2=1$
Taking the square root of both sides yields $x-2=\pm 1$, so $x=3$ or $x=1$
Thus, $m=3$ and $n=1$, so $m-n=3-1=\boxed{2}$.
Distributing the $x$ on the left-hand side gives $x^2 + xy = x^2 + 8$
Thus, $xy = \boxed{8}$.
The sum of the roots of $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $\frac{-b}{a}$
Plugging in the given values, we see the answer is $\frac{-(-4)}{1}=\boxed{4}$.
We have  \[f(x) = x^{-1} + \frac{x^{-1}}{1+x^{-1}} = \frac1x + \frac{1/x}{1+\frac{1}{x}}.\] Therefore, we have  \begin{align*}f(-2) &= \frac{1}{-2} + \frac{\frac{1}{-2}}{1 + \frac{1}{-2}} \\&= -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{-1/2}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} \\&= -\frac12 + \frac{-1/2}{1/2} \\&= -\frac12-1 = -\frac{3}{2}.\end{align*} So, we have \begin{align*}
f(f(-2)) = f(-3/2) &= \frac{1}{-3/2} + \frac{1/(-3/2)}{1 + \frac{1}{-3/2}} \\
&= -\frac23 + \frac{-2/3}{1 -\frac23} = -\frac23 + \frac{-2/3}{1/3}\\
&= -\frac23 - 2 = \boxed{-\frac83}.\end{align*}
Since $a$ and $b$ must be positive integers and since $b$ must be at least 2, we know that the maximum value of $a$ is 3 (because $4^2+4(2)=24>15$)
Since $a$ must be at least 2, $a$ only has two possible values
If $a=2$, then we have $2^b+2b=15$, or $2(2^{b-1}+b)=15$, or $2^{b-1}+b=7.5$
However, since $b$ must be a positive integer, $2^{b-1}+b$ must also be an integer, and we have a contradiction
Therefore, $a=3$, and we have $3^b+3b=15$
A quick check shows that $3^2+3(2)=15$, or $b=2$
Thus, the only solution to $a\star b = 15$ is $3\star2$, giving us $a+b=3+2=\boxed{5}$.
Every real number can be expressed in the form $1-x$ for some real $x$
Thus, as $x$ runs through the real numbers, $(1-x)^2$ runs through all nonnegative values, and its reciprocal (which is $r(x)$) runs through all positive values
The range of $r(x)$ is $\boxed{(0,\infty)}$.
The ball traveled $100+50+25+12.5 = 187.5$ feet on its four descents
The ball also traveled $50+25+12.5 = 87.5$ feet on its three ascents
Thus, the ball traveled $187.5+87.5 = \boxed{275}$ feet total.
Factoring the right side, we can see that $(x-3)(x+3) = 21(x-3)$
Simplifying, we have $(x-3)(x+3) - 21(x-3) = (x-3)(x-18),$ and therefore our $p$ and $q$ are 18 and 3
Therefore, $p - q = \boxed{15}.$
We get rid of the cube root sign by cubing both sides
This gives us $2-\frac{x}{2} = -27$
Solving this equation gives $x =\boxed{58}$.
We see that 1 is in the range of $f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c$ if and only if the equation $x^2 - 5x + c = 1$ has a real root
We can re-write this equation as $x^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0$
The discriminant of this quadratic is $(-5)^2 - 4(c - 1) = 29 - 4c$
The quadratic has a real root if and only if the discriminant is nonnegative, so $29 - 4c \ge 0$
Then $c \le 29/4$, so the largest possible value of $c$ is $\boxed{\frac{29}{4}}$.
If Lucky Lacy missed $x$ out of $5x$ problems, then she must have gotten $5x-x=4x$ of them correct
Therefore, the percentage of problems that Lacy got correct is  $\frac{4x}{5x}=\frac{4}{5}=\frac{80}{100}=\boxed{80 \%}$.
Writing the equation $\log_{16} (r+16) = \frac{5}{4}$ in exponential notation gives $r+16 = 16^{\frac{5}{4}} = (2^4)^{\frac{5}{4}} = 2^5 = 32$
Solving $r+16 = 32$ gives $r = \boxed{16}$.
This is a geometric sequence with first term $\frac{1}{4}$ and common ratio $\frac{1}{2}$
Thus the sum of the first $n$ terms is:
$\frac{63}{128}=\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n}{1-\frac{1}{2}}\right)=\frac{2^n-1}{2^{n+1}}$.
We see that $\frac{63}{128}=\frac{2^6-1}{2^7}$, so $n=\boxed{6}$.
Noelle only has to do 1 homework assignment to earn her first point, and the same is true for each of her first five points
She must then do 2 homework assignments to earn her sixth point, seventh point, and so on, up to her tenth point
Continuing, we see that Noelle must do a total of \[1+1+1+1+1+2+2+2+2+2+\dots+5+5+5+5+5\] homework assignments to earn 25 points.
This sum may be rewritten as $5(1+2+3+4+5)=5(15)=\boxed{75}$.
There is a point of intersection for each $x$ such that $f(x^2)=f(x^4)$
Since $f$ is invertible, this equation is satisfied only if $x^2=x^4$, so we simply count solutions to that equation
We can rearrange the equation $x^2=x^4$ as follows: \begin{align*}
0 &= x^4-x^2 \\
0 &= x^2(x^2-1) \\
0 &= x^2(x+1)(x-1)
\end{align*}The last factorization shows that the solutions are $x=-1,0,1$
Therefore, the graphs of $y=f(x^2)$ and $y=f(x^4)$ must intersect at exactly $\boxed{3}$ points.
An $x$-intercept is a point on the graph that lies on the $x$-axis, so $y = 0$
We can set $y = 0$ to get a unique value for $x$, namely 1
Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{1}$ $x$-intercept.

Since $2>0$ we know that $f(2)=a(2)+3=5$
Solving for $a$, we get that $a=1$
With $x=0$, we get that $f(0)=ab=5$
We already know that $a=1$, so $b=5$
Because -2 is negative, we know that $f(-2)=b(-2)+c=(5)(-2)+c=-10$
This tells us that $c=0$, so our answer is $a+b+c=1+5+0=\boxed{6}$.
We can find the roots of this equation by factoring the quadratic as $(x + 18)(x - 3) = 0$
This gives us the solutions $x = -18$ or $x = 3$
We want the greater solution, so our answer is $\boxed{3}$.
Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $4$, its highest degree term is of the form $ax^4$
Substituting $x^3$ for $x$ shows that the highest degree term is $a(x^3)^4 = ax^{12}$, which means that $f(x^3)$ has degree $12$
Similarly, $g(x^2)$ has degree $10$
Since the degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the two polynomials, the degree of $f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2)$ is $12+10=\boxed{22}$.
Multiplying both sides by $4x-4$ and by 3 gives $3(3x-1) = 2(4x-4)$
Expanding the products on both sides gives $9x-3 = 8x - 8$
Subtracting $8x$ from both sides $x -3 = -8$ and adding 3 to both sides gives $x = \boxed{-5}$.
Replacing the $4$ with $2^2$ we have $2^2 = 2^{5r+1}$, so $2=5r+1$
Solve for $r$ to get $r=\boxed{\frac{1}{5}}$
Let the two integers be $x$ and $246-x$
The product which needs to be maximized is $(x)(246-x)=246x-x^2$
Now we complete the square: \begin{align*}
-(x^2-246x)&=-(x^2-246x+15129-15129)\\
&=-(x-123)^2+15129\\
\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, $-(x-123)^2\le 0$
Therefore, the expression is maximized when $x-123=0$, so $x=123$
Therefore, the greatest product obtainable is $-(123-123)^2+15129=\boxed{15129}$.
We first find that $f(2) = 9.$ Therefore, $g(f(2)) = g(9) = 39.$ Finally, $f(g(f(2))) = f(39) = \boxed{120}.$
We could substitute the points into the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$, and then complete the square to find the coordinates of the vertex.
However, a much faster way is to recognize that two of the points, namely $(-1,7)$ and $(5,7)$, have the same $y$-coordinate
Therefore, these two points are symmetric about the parabola's axis of symmetry
The axis must pass through the midpoint of the segment connecting these two symmetric points, so the axis must pass through $\left(\frac{-1+5}{2},\frac{7+7}{2}\right)$, which is $(2,7)$
Therefore, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line through $(2,7)$
This line is the graph of the equation $x=2$
The axis of symmetry also passes through the vertex of the parabola, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\boxed{2}$.
We have a geometric sequence with first term 10 and common ratio $1/2$
Any term in this sequence can be represented as $10\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k$, where $k$ is the number of bounces (for example, when $k=1$, $10\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k=5$, or the height of the $k=1^\text{st}$ bounce)
We need to find the smallest $k$ such that $10\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k<1$
Through trial and error, we find that $k=4$, so it takes $\boxed{4}$ bounces for the maximum height to be less than 1 foot.
We can factor the numerator to get $y = \frac{(x+1)(x+2)}{x+1}$
If we exclude the case where $x = -1$, the function is equivalent to $y = x+2$
However, because $x$ cannot equal $-1$, $y$ cannot equal 1
Therefore, the range is all real numbers except for 1, which we may write as $y \in \boxed{(-\infty, 1)\cup(1, \infty)}.$
Let $x$ be the smaller integer and $y$ be the larger integer
We have $x+y=30$ and $2y-3x=5$
Solving for $x$ in terms of $y$ using the first equation, we get $x=30-y$
Now we substitute $x$ in terms of $y$ into the second equation
\begin{align*}
2y-3(30-y)&=5\quad\Rightarrow\\
2y-90+3y&=5\quad\Rightarrow\\
5y&=95\quad\Rightarrow\\
\end{align*} And $x=30-19=11$
The positive difference is $y-x=\boxed{8}$.
We can factor the quadratic $6x^2-47x+15$ as $(2x-15)(3x-1)$
So we have $|6x^2-47x+15|=|(2x-15)(3x-1)|=|2x-15|\cdot|3x-1|$
In order for $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its only divisors must be $1$ and itself
Thus one of $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to $1$.
If $|3x-1|=1$, then $3x-1=1$ or $3x-1=-1$
These equations yield $x=\frac{2}{3}$ and $x=0$, respectively
We throw out $x=\frac{2}{3}$ since it is not an integer, and keep $x=0$ as a candidate.
If $|2x-15|=1$, then $2x-15=1$, in which case $2x=16$ and $x=8$, or $2x-15=-1$, in which case $2x=14$ and $x=7$.
Thus our candidates for the greatest $x$ are $0, 7$, and $8$
It remains to check whether the other factor is prime
We first check $x=8$
Since $|2x-15|=1$, we know $|2x-15|\cdot|3x-1|=|3x-1|=|24-1|=23$, which is prime
Thus $\boxed{8}$ is the largest integer for which $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime.
Let $y = f(x)$
Then, $f(f(x)) = f(y) = 5$, so either $x^2 - 4 = 5$ or $x + 3 = 5$
Solving the first equations yields that $y = f(x) = \pm 3$, both of which are greater than or equal to $-4$
The second equation yields that $y = 2$, but we discard this solution because $y \ge -4$.
Hence $f(x) = \pm 3$, so $x^2 - 4 = \pm 3$ or $x + 3 = \pm 3$
The first equation yields that $x = \pm 1, \pm \sqrt{7}$, all of which are greater than or equal to $-4$
The second equation yields that $x = -6, 0$, of which only the first value, $x = -6$, is less than $-4$
Hence, there are $\boxed{5}$ values of $x$ that satisfy $f(f(x)) = 5$: $x = -6, -\sqrt{7}, -1, 1, \sqrt{7}$, as we can check.
A quadratic has exactly one distinct solution when its discriminant is 0
The discriminant of $4x^2 + nx + 25$ is $n^2 - 4(4)(25)$
Setting this equal to 0 gives $n^2 - 400 = 0$, so $n^2 = 400$
The positive solution of this equation is $n = \boxed{20}$.
After moving the constant over, we get a quadratic expression and solve for the roots: \begin{align*}
x^2-2x-35&>0\quad\Rightarrow\\
(x-7)(x+5)&>0.
\end{align*} The quadratic expression equals 0 at $x=7$ and $x=-5$, meaning it changes sign at each root
Now we look at the sign of the quadratic when $x<-5$, when $-5<x<7$, and when $x>7$
When $x<-5$, $(x-7)$ and $(x+5)$ are both negative, so the product is positive
When $-5<x<7$, $(x+5)$ becomes positive, while $(x-7)$ remains negative - the product is negative
When $x>7$, both factors are positive, so the product is positive
So, $(x-7)(x+5)>0$ when $x<-5$ or $x>7$, which means our answer in interval notation is $\boxed{(-\infty, -5) \cup (7, \infty)}$.
Alternatively, consider that the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, so a graph of $(x-7)(x+5)=0$ would open up
When there are two distinct roots, the shape of the parabola means that product is negative when $x$ is between the roots and positive when $x$ is less than both roots or greater than both roots.
Multiplying the whole equation by $6x$ will get rid of the fractions: \begin{align*}
5x^2+6x&=18 \quad \Longrightarrow \\
5x^2+6x-18&=0.
\end{align*}Since the expression on the left-hand side does not factor easily, we use the quadratic formula to get \begin{align*}
x&=\frac{-6\pm\sqrt{36+360}}{10}\\
&=\frac{-6\pm\sqrt{396}}{10}\\
&=\frac{-6\pm6\sqrt{11}}{10}.
\end{align*}Therefore, the largest possible value for $x$ is $\frac{-6+6\sqrt{11}}{10}$, or $\frac{-3+3\sqrt{11}}{5}$
Applying this to $\frac{a+b\sqrt{c}}{d}$, $a=-3$, $b=3$, $c=11$, and $d=5$
\[\frac{acd}{b}=\frac{-3\cdot11\cdot5}{3}=\boxed{-55}.\]
It may be easier to work with this if we leave both sides in somewhat factored form: \begin{align*}
(5x)^4&=(10x)^3\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 5^4 x^4&=10^3 x^3\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 5^4 x^4&=5^3 2^3 x^3
\end{align*} Since $x$ is non-zero, we can cancel the common factor of $x^3$: $$\Rightarrow\qquad 5^4 x=5^3 2^3$$ Now, cancel $5^3$: \begin{align*}
5x&=8\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x&=\boxed{\frac{8}{5}}
\end{align*}
The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\times$ price of each book, or $p(130-5p)=130p-5p^2$
We want to maximize this expression by completing the square
We can factor out a $-5$ to get $-5(p^2-26p)$.
To complete the square, we add $(26/2)^2=169$ inside the parenthesis and subtract $-5\cdot169=-845$ outside
We are left with the expression
\[-5(p^2-26p+169)+845=-5(p-13)^2+845.\]Note that the $-5(p-13)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative
Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-5(p-13)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=13$
Thus, the store should charge $\boxed{13}$ dollars for the book.
We know that $a+bi+c+di+e+fi=-i$
Thus, the real parts add up to 0 and the imaginary parts add up to -1
We then have  \begin{align*}
a+c+e&=0\\
b+d+f&=-1\\
\end{align*}We know that $b=1$, therefore $d+f=\boxed{-2}$
We have that $8=x^2+y^2=x^2+2xy+y^2-2xy=(x+y)^2-2xy=16-2xy$, therefore $xy=\frac{16-8}{2}=4$
Since $x^3+y^3=(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)=(x+y)(x^2+y^2-xy)$, we can directly substitute in the numerical values for each algebraic expression
This gives us $x^3+y^3=(4)(8-4)=\boxed{16}$.
First, we use the distributive property to expand the first two factors:
\begin{align*}
4(x-5)(x+8) &= (4\cdot x - 4 \cdot 5) (x+8)\\
&=(4x-20)(x+8)
\end{align*}We use the distributive property again by adding the product of $4x-20$ and $x$ to the product of $4x-20$ and 8:
\begin{align*}
(4x-20)(x+8) &= (4x-20) \cdot x +(4x-20) \cdot 8\\
&= x(4x-20) + 8(4x-20)
\end{align*}
We use the distributive property again and combine like terms:
\begin{align*}
x(4x-20) + 8(4x-20) &= 4x^2 - 20x + 32x - 160\\
&= \boxed{4x^2 + 12x - 160}
\end{align*}
We use the distance formula: $\sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \boxed{5}$.
- OR -
We note that the points $(0, 4)$, $(3, 0)$, and $(0, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 3 and 4
This is a Pythagorean triple, so the hypotenuse must have length $\boxed{5}$.
By the distance formula, the distance from $(2a, a-4)$ to $(4, -1)$ is $\sqrt{(2a-4)^2+((a-4)-(-1))^2}$
Setting this equal to $2\sqrt{10}$, we find \begin{align*}
(2a-4)^2+(a-3)^2 &= \sqrt{40}^2\\
4a^2-16a+16+a^2-6a+9&= 40\\
5a^2-22a-15&=0\\
(a-5)(5a+3)&=0
\end{align*}The possible values for $a$ are $5$ and $-\frac{3}{5}$
Thus, the answer is $5\times-\frac{3}{5}=\boxed{-3}$.
$525^2 - 475^2$ can also be expressed as $(525+475)(525-475)$
This simplifies to $1000 \cdot 50$, which equals $\boxed{50000}$.
The given expression is undefined when the denominator is zero
Thus, we want to find the sum of the zeros $y$ to the quadratic $y^2-5y+4$
Since for a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the solutions is $-b/a$, the sum of the zeros of the quadratic $y^2-5y+4$ is $5/1=\boxed{5}$.
In the quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$, the roots sum to $\frac{-b}{a}$ and multiply to $\frac{c}{a}$
Therefore, in the equation $2x^2-mx+n=0$, the roots sum to $\frac{m}{2}=6$ and multiply to $\frac{n}{2}=10$
Solving the first equation, we see that $m=12$ and solving the second equation, we see that $n=20$
Therefore, $m+n=12+20=\boxed{32}$.
When using the distributive property for the first time, we add the product of $x+3$ and $x$ to the product of $x+3$ and $-8$:
\begin{align*}
(x+3)(x-8) &= (x+5) \cdot x + (x+5) \cdot (-8)\\
&= x(x+3) - 8(x+3)
\end{align*}We use the distributive property again and combine like terms:
\begin{align*}
x(x+3) - 8(x+3) &= x^2 + 3x - 8x - 24\\
&= \boxed{x^2 - 5x - 24}
\end{align*}
We complete the square
We can square $x - \frac{5}{2}$ to get $x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4}$, so $x^2 - 5x = \left( x - \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{25}{4}$
We see that $k = \boxed{-\frac{25}{4}}$.
First of all, let us place everything to one side: \begin{align*}
56x^2 + 27 &= 89x - 8\\
56x^2 - 89x + 35 &= 0.
\end{align*}Now we must factor
Knowing that $x = \frac{5}{7}$ is a solution to this equation, we can reason that $(7x - 5)$ must be one of the factors of $56x^2 - 89x + 35$ which means that $(8x - 7)$ must be the other factor, since the linear terms must multiply to $56x^2$ and the constant terms must multiply to $35.$
We can easily verify that indeed, $56x^2 - 89x + 35 = (7x - 5)(8x - 7),$ therefore $x = \boxed{\frac{7}{8}}$ is our answer.
The point $(1.5,4)$ is on the graph
This means that $p(1.5)=\boxed{4}$.
First, we combine the fraction on the left to give $\frac{5x-3}{x+3} = \frac{1}{x+3}$
Then, multiplying both sides by $x+3$ gets rid of the denominators and leaves $5x-3 = 1$
Adding 3 to both sides gives $5x=4$, so $x = \boxed{\frac{4}{5}}$.
$5x^2+9x-18$ can be written as $(5x-6)(x+3)$
Because $x$ must be positive, the only factor that can be considered is $(5x-6)$
Therefore: \begin{align*}
5x-6&=0\\
5x&=6\\
x&=\boxed{\frac{6}{5}}
\end{align*}
The second term seems difficult to calculate directly, so we will first find the value of the first term
Let the first term be $a$
Because the sum of the series is $25,$ we have  \[25= \frac{a}{1-\left(\frac{-1}{3}\right)} = \frac{a}{\frac{4}{3}} = \frac{3a}{4}.\]Thus, $a=\frac{100}{3}.$ Now, we can calculate the second term knowing the value of the first
The second term $ar$ is \[ar=\left( \frac{100}{3} \right)\left(\frac{-1}{3}\right)=\boxed{\frac{-100}{9}} .\]
Because $120\%$ of 50 is $1.2(50) = 60$, when we increase 50 by $120\%$, we get $50 + 60 = \boxed{110}$
Alternatively, we could find our answer by multiplying 50 by $1 + 1.2 = 2.2$, which also gives us $\boxed{110}$.
Substitute $(2,3)$ and $(4,3)$ into the equation to give \[
3 = 4 + 2b + c \quad\text{and}\quad 3 = 16 + 4b + c.
\] Subtracting corresponding terms in these equations gives $0 = 12 + 2b$
b = -6\quad\text{and}\quad c = 3 -4 -2(-6) = \boxed{11}.
The parabola is symmetric about the vertical line through its vertex, and the points $(2,3)$ and $(4,3)$  have the same $y$-coordinate
The vertex has $x$-coordinate $(2+4)/2=3$, so  the equation has the form \[
y = (x-3)^2 + k
\] for some constant $k$
Since $y = 3$ when $x = 4$, we have $3 = 1^2 + k$ and $k=2$
Consequently the constant term $c$ is \[
(-3)^2 + k = 9 + 2 = 11.
The parabola is symmetric about the vertical line through its vertex, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is 3
Also, the coefficient  of $x^2$ is 1, so the parabola opens upward and the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is 2
We find $c$, the $y$-intercept of the graph by observing that the $y$-intercept occurs 3 units away horizontally from the vertex
On this interval the graph decreased by $3^2 = 9$ units hence the $y$-intercept is 9 units higher than the vertex, so $c = 9 + 2 = \boxed{11}.$
The graph of the parabola is shown below:
Label f;
f.p=fontsize(6);
xaxis(-2.5,.75,Ticks(f, 1.0));
yaxis(-5,8,Ticks(f, 2.0));
real f(real x)
return 4x^2+7x-1;
draw(graph(f,-2.5,.75));
dot((.5,3.5));
dot((-.5,-3.5));
label("$A$", (.5,3.5), E);
label("$B$", (-.5,-3.5), E);
[/asy]
Let the coordinates of point $A$ be $(x,y)$
Then since the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ is the origin, the coordinates of $B$ are $(-x,-y)$
Both of these points must lie on the parabola, so we plug them into the equation for the parabola to get the equations \begin{align*}
y&=4x^2+7x-1,\\
-y&=4(-x)^2+7(-x)-1 \Rightarrow y=-4x^2+7x+1.
\end{align*}Setting the two equations equal to eliminate $y$, we have $4x^2+7x-1=-4x^2+7x+1$, or $8x^2=2\Rightarrow x^2=\frac{1}{4}$
So $x=\frac{1}{2}$ (the negative alternative for $x$ gives the same answer) and $y=4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2+7\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)-1=\frac{7}{2}$
Thus, point $A$ is at $(1/2,7/2)$ and point $B$ is at $(-1/2,-7/2)$
The length of $\overline{AB}$ is then $\sqrt{\left(-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2+\left(-\frac{7}{2}-\frac{7}{2}\right)^2}=\sqrt{50}$
Hence, $AB^2=\boxed{50}$.
Going backwards, we see that the tree was $32/2 = 16$ feet at the end of 5 years, $16/2 = 8$ feet at the end of 4 years, and $8/2 = \boxed{4 \text{ feet}}$ at the end of 3 years.
Completing the square, we get $(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33$
Therefore, the center of the circle is $\boxed{(1, 2)}$.
Simplifying, we have  $18(x+y)=xy$, so $xy - 18x - 18y = 0$ Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by adding 324 to both sides, we get $xy-18x-18y +324=324$, so \[(x-18)(y-18)=324.\]Now we seek the minimal $x+y,$ which occurs when $x-18$ and $y-18$ are as close to each other in value as possible
The two best candidates are $(x-18,y-18)=(12,27)$ or $(9,36),$ of which $(x,y)=(30,45)$ attains the minimum sum of $\boxed{75}$.
Clearly, the inequality has some solutions for which $2x+7$ is negative
For example, if $x = -4$, then $2x+7 = -1$, so $|2x+7| = 1$, which is less than 16
As we make $x$ even smaller, $2x+7$ gets even more less than zero, so $|2x+7|$ gets larger
But how small can we make $x$?  To figure this out, we note that if $2x+7$ is negative, then $|2x+7| = -(2x+7)$
Then, our inequality becomes $-(2x+7) \le 16$
Multiplying both sides by $-1$ (and flipping the direction of the inequality symbol) gives $2x +7 \ge -16$
Subtracting 7 and then dividing by 2 gives $x \ge -11.5$
So, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ is $\boxed{-11}$
Checking, we see that when $x=-11$, we have $|2x + 7| = 15$, which is less than 16.
The greatest integer less than $-2.54$ is $-3$; the smallest integer greater than $25.4$ is $26$
So $\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor + \lceil 25.4 \rceil = -3+26=\boxed{23}$.
Instead of calculating $a - b - c$, Bill calculated $a - b + c$
Therefore, the value of $a - b$ is simply the average of the two, making for $\frac{11+3}{2} = \boxed{7}$.
Since $\frac1{13}=13^{-1}$, we can express $\left(\frac{1}{13}\right)^{n-24}$ as $13^{-n+24}$
We have that $13^{3n}=\left(\frac{1}{13}\right)^{n-24}=13^{-n+24}$, so setting the exponents equal we find that $3n=-n+24$, or $n=\frac{24}{4}=\boxed{6}$.
We simply plug into $b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(3)(-12) = 49 + 144 = \boxed{193},$ and that is our answer.
Sarah will receive $4.5$ points for the three questions she leaves unanswered, so she must earn at least $100-4.5=95.5$ points on the first $22$ problems
Because \[
15 < \frac{95.5}{6} < 16,
\]she must solve at least $\boxed{16}$ of the first $22$ problems correctly
This would give her a score of $100.5.$
$\log_24=\boxed{2}$, so $\log_2(4^2) = \log_2((2^2)^2) = \log_2 (2^4) = \boxed{4}$
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $-6.$  Since they are in the ratio $2:1,$ the roots are $-4$ and $-2.$  Then $k$ is their product, namely $(-4)(-2) = \boxed{8}.$
32000 bacteria is $32000/500=64$ times the number currently in the lab dish
Since $64=2^6$, the bacteria had to double 6 times to reach this number
Since the bacteria double every four hours, it takes $4\cdot6=\boxed{24}$ hours.
We compute that $\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor = \lfloor 146.41 \rfloor = 146$ and $\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12\cdot 12 = 144,$ so $\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor - \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = \boxed{2}.$
$y = 7$ represents a horizontal line that intersects a circle of radius $10$ around the origin
The symmetry of the circle guarantees that the points of intersection have a sum which add up to $0.$
Alternatively, we can simply substitute $7$ into the second equation for $y,$ to get that $x^2 = 51.$ Then, the two possible values for $x$ are $\sqrt{51},-\sqrt{51}.$ It's clear that they add up to $\boxed{0}.$
Looking at the graph, we can see the line intersects the y-axis at y=1
This is the y-intercept, which is equal to the value of $b$
Now, we need to find the slope of the line
Looking carefully, we can see that for every one unit to the right the line travels, it goes up by two units
For example, starting from the y-intercept at $(0,1)$, the line passes through a lattice point one unit over and two units up from there, at $(1,3)$
The rise over run is then $\frac{2}{1}$, so the slope is 2
The equation of this line is $y=2x+1$
Therefore, $mb=2(1)=\boxed{2}$.
We can start by pairing the terms in this expression and factoring them as a difference of squares: \begin{align*}
&\phantom{=} \,\,\, (19^2-17^2)+(15^2-13^2)+(11^2-9^2)+(7^2-5^2)+(3^2-1^2) \\
&= 2(19 + 17) + 2(15 + 13) + 2(11 + 9) + 2(7 + 5) + 2(3 + 1)\\
&= 2(19 + 17 + 15 + 13 + 11 + 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1) \\
&= 2(100) \\
&= \boxed{200}.
\end{align*}
Distributing the left side of the inequality, we have $x^{2}+6x+9\leq1$, which simplifies to $x^{2}+6x+8\leq0$
This can be factored into $(x+2)(x+4)\leq0$, and we can now look at the three regions formed by this inequality: $x<-4, -4\leq x\leq -2,$ and $x>-2$
We know that the signs in each of these regions alternate, and we test any number in each of the regions to make sure
Plugging into $(x+2)(x+4)$, any $x$ less than $-4$ yields a positive product, and any $x$ greater than $-2$ also yields a positive product
The remaining interval between $-2$ and $-4$ inclusive yields a nonpositive product
Thus, there are $\boxed{3}$ integers which satisfy the inequality: $-2, -3$, and $-4$.
Completing the square gives us $(x+3)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 13 - c$
Since we want the radius to be 4, we must have $13 - c = 4^2$
It follows that $c = \boxed{-3}$.
The problem is asking for the sum of the integers from $-12$ to 3
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms
The number of integers from $-12$ to 3 is $3 - (-12) + 1 = 16$, so the sum is $(-12 + 3)/2 \cdot 16 = \boxed{-72}$.
The numbers of canoes built by BoatsRUs each month form a geometric sequence: 7, 14, 28, 56, 112
The first term is 7 and the common ratio is 2, so the sum of these terms is $\frac{7(2^5-1)}{2-1} = \boxed{217}$.
Since $(4,7)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we know  \[7=f(4).\]Using that $f(4\cdot1)=7$, we can also say \[3f(4\cdot1)+5=3\cdot7+5=26=2\cdot13.\]Therefore $(x,y)=(1,13)$ is on the graph of  \[2y=3f(4\cdot x)+5.\]The sum of these coordinates is $1+13=\boxed{14}$.
Given the number of sides of a polygon, $n$, the number of diagonals is given by $D=\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$
To find the number of sides given the number of diagonals, we can solve this equation for $n$
\begin{align*}D&=\frac{n(n-3)}{2} \\ 2D&=n^2-3n \\ 0&=n^2-3n-2D.\end{align*}  Then, using the quadratic formula we have $n=\frac{3\pm\sqrt{3^2-4(1)(-2D)}}{2(1)}=\frac{3\pm\sqrt{9+8D}}{2}$.
Since we are given that $D=9$, we have $n=\frac{3\pm\sqrt{9+8(9)}}{2}=\frac{3\pm9}{2}=-3\text{ or }6$
Since we must have a positive number of sides, a polygon with nine diagonals has $\boxed{6}$ sides.
We complete the square on the right side by adding $(12/2)^2 = 36$ to both sides: $y+36 = x^2 + 12x + 36 + 5$, so $y+36 = (x+6)^2 + 5$, which gives $y = (x+6)^2 - 31$
Since $(x+6)^2$ is nonnegative, and $(x+6)^2=0$ when $x=-6$, the smallest possible value of $y$ is $\boxed{-31}$.
We have  \begin{align*}
(10^{0.5})(10^{0.3})(10^{0.2})(10^{0.1})(10^{0.9})&= 10^{0.5+0.3+0.2+0.1+0.9}\\
&=10^2\\
&=\boxed{100}.
\end{align*}
We have $36-9x^2 = 6^2 - (3x)^2 = (6-3x)(6+3x)$
We can factor a 3 out of each of $6-3x$ and $6+3x$ to give $3\cdot(2-x)\cdot 3\cdot(2+x) = \boxed{9(2-x)(2+x)}$
(We could also have factored out a 9 at the beginning: $36-9x^2 = 9(4-x^2)=9(2-x)(2+x)$.)
We factor the quadratic, getting $(a-7)(a-3) \le 0$
The expression is equal to $0$ when $a=7 \text{ or } 3$
When $a \le 3$ or $a \ge 7$, the quadratic is positive, since the two factors have the same sign
When $3 \le a \le 7$, the quadratic is non-positive
Therefore, $a=\boxed{7}$ is the greatest value of $a$ for which $a^2 - 10a + 21\le 0$.
Since the vertex of the parabola is $(3,7)$, the parabola is symmetric around the line $x = 3$
Furthermore, the two $x$-intercepts of the parabola are also symmetric around this line
One $x$-intercept is $(-2,0)$, whose distance from the line $x = 3$ is $3 - (-2) = 5$, so the other $x$-intercept is at $(3 + 5,0) = (8,0)$
The $x$-coordinate of this $x$-intercept is $\boxed{8}$.
Let the sides perpendicular to the barn be of length $x$
Notice that there are a total of $1200/5=240$ feet of fencing
Therefore, the side parallel to the barn has length $240-2x$, so the area to be maximized is $240x-2x^2$
Completing the square results in $-2(x-60)^2+7200$, which is maximized when $x=60$
Therefore, the side parallel to the barn has length $240-2(60)=\boxed{120}$ feet.
We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively
Let the two roots of the equation be $p$ and $q$
Then $p+q=k/2$
However the only other restriction on $p$ and $q$ is that $pq = 4$ and that $p$ and $q$ are distinct integers
For each such possibility $(p,q)$, we also have the possibility $(-p,-q)$ since $(-p)(-q) = pq = 4$
This gives two values of $k$: $k=2(p+q)$ and $k=2(-p-q)$
Since these occur in such pairs, the sum of all possible values of $k$ is $\boxed{0}$.
Alternatively, one can note that the only way to factor 4 into 2 distinct integer factors is $4\cdot1$ and $(-4)(-1)$, so that the two possible values of $k$ are $10$ and $-10$, given a sum of $0$.
Squaring both sides, we have $\frac{30^2}{50^2}=\frac{y}{50}$
Solving for $y$ yields $y=900/50=\boxed{18}$.
We simplify, bearing in mind that $i^2 = -1$
We get  \begin{align*}
(4-5i)(-5+5i) &= 4(-5) + 4(5i) -5i(-5) -5i(5i) \\ &= -20 +20i +25i +25 \\ &= \boxed{5 + 45i}.
\end{align*}
Call the constant $r$
To get from $2$ to $\frac{1}{2}$, we multiplied by $r$, so $2r = \frac{1}{2}$, or $r = \frac{1}{4}$
To get from 128 to $x$, we multiply by $\frac{1}{4}$, so $x = 128 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 32$
To get from 32 to $y$, we multiply by $\frac{1}{4}$, so $y = 32 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 8$
Thus, $x + y = 32 + 8 = \boxed{40}$.
We know $\log_{4}3=x$ so $4^x=3$
We also know $\log_{2}27=kx$ so $2^{kx}=27$
We need to combine these equations, but note that $27=3^3$, so cube the first equation: $(4^x)^3=3^3=27$, so $4^{3x}=27=2^{kx}$
But $4=2^2$, so we can substitute to get the same base: $(2^2)^{3x}=2^{kx}$, so $2^{6x}=2^{kx}$
Then $6x=kx$ and $\boxed{k=6}$.
Substituting in, we have $2(2-i)+3(-1+i)$
Expanding, we have $4-2i-3+3i$; adding, we have $\boxed{1+i}$.
The product of the roots equals the constant term divided by the coefficient of the quadratic term, or $(-500)/18 = \boxed{-\frac{250}{9}}$.
For $u(x)$ to be defined, $\sqrt x$ must be defined and nonzero
This is true for $x$ in the domain $\boxed{(0,\infty)}$.
We complete the square.
To begin, since $10x^2+100x+1000$ has a leading coefficient of $10$, we factor out this coefficient to obtain $$10x^2+100x+1000 = (10)(x^2+10x+100).$$Now we turn our attention to the quadratic in the second set of parentheses
This quadratic looks like the expansion of $(x+5)^2$, except that the constant term is different
Specifically, $(x+5)^2=x^2+10x+25$, so $x^2+10x+100 = (x+5)^2+75$
This gives us $$10x^2+100x+1000 = (10)[(x+5)^2+75].$$This is almost in the target form, $a(x+b)^2+c$
To get it into that precise form, we must distribute the $(10)$: $$10x^2+100x+1000 = 10(x+5)^2 + 750.$$Then we have $a=10$, $b=5$, and $c=750$, so $a+b+c = \boxed{765}$.
Solving $pq = 4$ for $p$ we see that $p = \frac{4}{q}$
Plugging this into $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$ we then get \[ \frac{q}{4} + \frac{1}{q} = 1 \Rightarrow q^2 - 4q +4 = 0 .\] Factoring this, we then see that  \[ (q-2)(q-2) = 0 \] which means that $q = \boxed{2}$
The first term is $-1$, the common ratio is $-2$, and there are 10 terms, so the sum equals \[\frac{(-1)((-2)^{10}-1)}{-2-1} = \frac{-1023}{-3} = \boxed{341}.\]
We can write the numerator as $4\sqrt{2}$, the denominator as $4-\sqrt{2}$
Then, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator
$$\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{4-\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{4+\sqrt{2}}{4+\sqrt{2}}=$$$$\frac{16\sqrt{2} + 8}{14}=$$$$\frac{8\sqrt{2}+4}{7}$$Therefore, $A+B+C+D=8+2+4+7=\boxed{21}$.
By the definition of $f(x)$, we have $f(3) = 3a+3b + 2$, so if we find $3a+3b$, we can find $f(3)$
Since $f(1) = a+b+2$ (by the definition of $f(x)$) and $f(1) = 5$, we have $a+b+2 = 5$, so $a+b = 3$
Multiplying this by 3 gives $3a+3b = 9$, so $f(3) = 3a+3b + 2 = 9+2 = \boxed{11}$
Notice that we didn't even need the information about $f(2)$!
Cross-multiplication gives  \[x^2+2x+3=(x+4)(x+5)=x^2+9x+20.\]Therefore \[0=7x+17\]and $x=\boxed{-\frac{17}7}$.
We take the ratio of consecutive terms: $$\cfrac{-\frac{4}{9}}{\frac{5}{6}}=\frac{-4}{9}\cdot \frac{6}{5}=\boxed{-\frac{8}{15}}.$$
We have the system of equations: \begin{align*}
x + y &= 399 \\
\frac{x}{y} &= 0.9 \\
\end{align*} From the second equation, multiplying both sides by $y$ gives $x=.9y$
Next, substituting the second equation into the first to eliminate $x$ gives $.9y+y=399$, or $y=210$
Plugging in this value into the first equation in the original system of equations gives $x+210=399$ or $x=189$
Thus, $y-x=210-189=\boxed{21}$.
The first approach that comes to mind is probably also the best one
So we cross-multiply to obtain $(x-4)(x-9) = 36$
Multiplying out the left-hand side and cancelling the 36 yields $x^2-13x = 0$, or $x(x-13)=0$
This equation has two solutions, $x=0$ and 13
Since we are looking for positive answers, we take $x=\boxed{13}$.
Since the problem asks for $a+b$, we look for a way to isolate $a+b$ from the given equations.
Notice that $a + 6a = 7a$ and $4b + 3b = 7b$
This gives us the key to isolating $a + b$
We simply add the two equations together:  \begin{align*}
7a + 7b &= 84 \\
7(a + b) &= 84 \\
a + b &= \frac{84}{7} \\
a + b &= \boxed{12}
\end{align*}
For the function to be continuous, both of the two expressions must have the same value when $x=3$
Therefore, $3+2=2(3)+a$
Solving, we get that $a=\boxed{-1}$.
The number of cans in each row form an arithmetic sequence, with first term 1 and common difference 2
If there are $n$ terms, then the terms are 1, 3, $\dots$, $2n - 1$.
The total number of cans is therefore the sum of the arithmetic series \[1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n - 1).\]The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $[1 + (2n - 1)]/2 \cdot n = n^2$.
Then from $n^2 = 100$, we get $n = \boxed{10}$.
Applying a $20\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $1-20\%=1-0.2=\frac{4}{5}$
Similarly, applying a $25\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $\frac{3}{4}$
Applying both discounts, we multiply by $\frac{4}{5}\cdot\frac{3}{4}=\frac{3}{5}=0.6$
Since $1-0.6=0.4=40\%$, multiplying by 0.6 gives a $\boxed{40\%}$ discount.
Let $x = \frac{a+b}{a-b}$
Then, $\frac{a-b}{a+b} = \frac 1x$, so the given expression is equal to $x + \frac 1x = \frac{x^2 + 1}{x}$
Suppose that the equation $\frac{x^2 + 1}{x} = k$ has no solution for some value of $k$
Re-arranging, $x^2 - kx + 1 = 0$
This is a quadratic equation with discriminant $k^2 - 4$; since the quadratic equation has no solution, it follows that $k^2 - 4 = (k-2)(k+2) < 0$
It follows that for $k < 2$, the given equation has no solution in $x$.
Thus, the smallest possible value of the given expression is $\frac{x^2+1}{x} = \boxed{2}$
Indeed, this is achievable if we take $a = 1, b = 0$.
We have $t^2 -121 = t^2 - 11^2 = \boxed{(t-11)(t+11)}$.
Substitute $1$ for $a$, $2$ for $b$, and $3$ for $c$ in the expression $b^2-4ac$ to find that $\#(1,2,3)=2^2-(4)(3)(1)=\boxed{-8}$.
Let the common ratio of the first sequence be $p$ and the common ratio of the second sequence be $r$
Then the equation becomes
$$kp^2-kr^2=3(kp-kr)$$Dividing both sides by $k$ (since the sequences are nonconstant, no term can be $0$), we get
$$p^2-r^2=3(p-r)$$The left side factors as $(p-r)(p+r)$
Since $p\neq r$, we can divide by $p-r$ to get
$$p+r=\boxed{3}$$
Setting the right-hand sides of the given equations equal gives $3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$
Combining like terms gives $2x^2+4x=16$
Dividing by $2$ gives $x^2+2x=8$, and rearranging gives $x^2 +2x - 8=0$
Factoring gives $(x+4)(x-2)=0$, so our solutions are $x=-4$ and $x=2$
Substituting these into either of the original equations to find the corresponding values of $y$, we find the points of intersection to be $\boxed{(-4, 27);(2, 15)}$.
Since $$(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca = (39) + 2(21) = 81,$$ it follows that $a+b+c = \pm 9$
Since $a,b,c \ge 0$ we find $a+b+c=\boxed{9}$.
The equation of the first line is $y = 10 x + b$ where $b$ is the $y$-intercept of the two lines
Since $(s, 0)$ lies on the line, we can plug this into the line's equation to get $0 = 10s + b\Rightarrow s = -\frac b{10}$
Similarly, the second line has equation  $y = 6 x + b$
Plugging $(t, 0)$ into this equation gives $0 = 6t + b \Rightarrow t = - \frac b6$
Thus $\frac st = -\frac b{10} \cdot - \frac 6b = \boxed{\frac 35}$.
We have $f(2) = 2(2) + 3 = 7$ and $g(2) = 3(2) - 2 = 4$, so \[\frac{f(g(f(2)))}{g(f(g(2)))} = \frac{f(g(7))}{g(f(4))}.\] We then have $g(7) = 3(7) - 2 = 19$ and $f(4) = 2(4) + 3 = 11$, so we have \[\frac{f(g(7))}{g(f(4))} = \frac{f(19)}{g(11)} = \frac{2(19) + 3}{3(11) - 2} = \boxed{\frac{41}{31}}.\]
The equation $y=-16t^2+22t+45$ can be rewritten as $y=(8t+9)(-2t+5)$
Because $t$ needs to be positive, set $-2t+5=0$ to represent the point where the ball reaches the ground
Therefore: \begin{align*}
-2t+5&=0\\
-2t&=-5\\
2t&=5\\
t&=\boxed{\frac{5}{2}}
\end{align*}
This 4-term geometric series has first term $a_0 = \frac13$ and ratio $r=\frac13$, so it has value  \begin{align*}
\dfrac{\dfrac13\left(1-\left(\dfrac13\right)^{4}\right)}{1-\frac13} &= \dfrac{\dfrac13(1-\left(\dfrac13\right)^{4})}{\dfrac23}\\
&=\dfrac12\left(1-\left(\dfrac13\right)^{4}\right)\\
&=\dfrac12\left(\dfrac{80}{81}\right)\\
&=\boxed{\dfrac{40}{81}}.
\end{align*}
Note that $70\%$ of 10 is 7, $80\%$ of 20 is 16 and $90\%$ of 30 is 27
Antonette answers $7+16+27=50$ problems correctly out of 60 problems in all
Her overall score is $\frac{50}{60}$ or $83.\overline{3}\%$
Rounded to the nearest percent, the answer is $\boxed{83\%}$.
$E(r,r,3)=r(r^3)=r^4$
So $r^4=625=5^4$, and $r=\boxed{5}$.
On the left-hand side, $x^2$ cancels, reducing the inequality to $x^2<10$
Since  $3^2=9<10$ while $4^2=16>10$, the greatest possible value of $x$ is $\boxed{3}$.
Substituting, $h(2) = f(g(2))$
Now, $$g(2) = \sqrt{f(2)} - 2 = \sqrt{2 \cdot 2 + 5} - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1.$$ Thus, $$h(2) = f(g(2)) = f(1) = 2 \cdot 1 + 5 = \boxed{7}.$$
We complete the square on the quadratic in $x$ by adding $(6/2)^2=9$ to both sides, and complete the square on the quadratic in $y$ by adding $(8/2)^2=16$ to both sides
We have the equation  \[(x^2+6x+9)+(y^2+8y+16)=25 \Rightarrow (x+3)^2+(y+4)^2=25\]We see that this is the equation of a circle with center $(-3,-4)$ and radius 5
Thus, the area of the region enclosed by this circle is $\pi \cdot 5^2=\boxed{25\pi}$.
Given that $\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0,$ we see that $x$ must be an integer
Otherwise, the ceiling of $x$ would be greater than the floor of $x.$ Therefore, $\lceil x \rceil = x$ and $\lceil x \rceil - x = \boxed{0}.$
The first term is $-1$, the common ratio is $3$, and there are 7 terms, so the sum equals \[\frac{(-1)(3^7-1)}{3-1} = \frac{-2186}{2} = \boxed{-1093}.\]
We can split the expression $|x-3|=2x+4$ into two separate cases
In the first case, \begin{align*} x-3&=2x+4
\\\Rightarrow \qquad -x&=7
\\\Rightarrow \qquad x&=-7
\end{align*}However if we plug this value of $x$ back into the original equation $|x-3|=2x+4$, we get that $|-7-3|=2(-7)+4$ or $10=-10$
Since this is clearly not a valid statement, the first case gives us no possible solutions.
In the second case, \begin{align*} x-3&=-(2x+4)
\\ x-3&=-2x-4
\\\Rightarrow \qquad 3x&=-1
\\\Rightarrow \qquad x&=-\frac13.
\end{align*}If we plug $-\frac13$ back into the initial equation, we get that $\left|-\frac13-3\right|=2\left(-\frac13\right)+4$ which simplifies to $\frac{10}{3}=\frac{10}{3}$
Since this is true, we can accept $x=-\frac13$ as a valid solution to the equation
Therefore, the only value of $x$ that satisfies the given equation is $\boxed{-\frac13}$.
Since the quadratic has only one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero
The discriminant is $b^2-4ac=64-4ac=0$, so $ac=\frac{64}{4}=16$
We need to find $a$ and $c$ given $a+c=10$ and $ac=16$
We could write a quadratic equation and solve, but instead we rely on clever algebraic manipulations: Since $a+c=10$, we have $$(a+c)^2=a^2+c^2+2ac=10^2=100.$$We subtract $4ac=64$ from each side to find $$a^2+c^2+2ac-4ac=a^2+c^2-2ac=100-64=36.$$We recognize each side as a square, so we take the square root of both sides: $$\sqrt{a^2+c^2-2ac}=\sqrt{(c-a)^2}=c-a=\sqrt{36}=6.$$(Technically we should take the positive and negative square root of both sides, but since $c>a$ we know $c-a>0$.) Thus we have  \begin{align*}
c-a&=6\\
c+a&=10
\end{align*}Summing these equations gives \begin{align*}
2c&=16\\
\Rightarrow\qquad c&=8,
\end{align*}and $a=10-c=2$
Thus our ordered pair $(a,c)$ is $\boxed{(2,8)}$.
Let $J$ represent James's current age and $L$ represent Louise's current age
Since James is six years older than Louise, we get $J=L+6$
We're also told in words that $J+8=4(L-4)$
We can substitute for $J$ in terms of $L$ into the second equation to get \[(L+6)+8=4(L-4).\] Expanding both products gives \[ L+14=4L-16.\] Adding 16 to both sides and subtracting 14 from both sides gives  $30=3L$, so $l=10$
So Louise is currently 10 years old, which means James is currently $10+6=16$ years old
The sum of their current ages is $10+16=\boxed{26}$ years.
The  point $(a,b)$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $(12,10)$ to the line $y=-5x+18$
The perpendicular has slope $\frac{1}{5}$, so its equation is \[
y=10+\frac{1}{5}(x-12)=\frac{1}{5}x+\frac{38}{5}.
\]The $x$-coordinate at the foot of the perpendicular satisfies the equation \[
\frac{1}{5}x+\frac{38}{5}=-5x+18,
\]so $x=2$ and $y=-5\cdot2+18=8$
Thus $(a,b) = (2,8)$, and $a+b = \boxed{10}$.
The formula for a geometric series is $\frac{a-ar^n}{1-r}$
Taking $a$ to be the initial $1$-cent deposit and $n$ to be the number of days Krista had money in her bank so far, we have the inequality $$\frac{1-2^n}{1-2}\geq 200 \Rightarrow 1-2^n\leq -200 \Rightarrow 201 \leq 2^n.$$The smallest power of 2 that is greater than 201 is $2^8$
Thus, $n=8$ and $\boxed{\text{Sunday}}$ is 7 days away from day $1$.
We begin by rewriting the equation as $2ab + 10a - 3b = 222$
We can then use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation to get $2ab + 10a - 3b - 15 = 207$
This can be factored into $$(2a - 3)(b + 5) = 207$$We know that the prime factorization of $207 = 3^2 \cdot 23$ and that both $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, so the only possible solutions $(a,b)$ are $$(a,b) = \{(13,4),(6,18),(2,202),(3,64)\}$$Out of these, only $(6,18)$ meets the requirement that $a+b=24$
Thus, $ab = \boxed{108}$.
To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+32t+15$
We will do this by completing the square
Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \[-16t^2+32t+15=-16(t^2-2t)+15\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-2/2)^2=1$ inside the parenthesis to get \begin{align*}
-16(t^2-2t)+15&=-16(t^2-2t+1-1)+15\\
&=-16([t-1]^2-1)+15\\
&=-16(t-1)^2+31
\end{align*}Since $-16(t-1)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-1)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+31=\boxed{31}$ feet.
We use the distance formula: \[\sqrt{(7 - 2)^2 + (15 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 144} = \boxed{13}.\]
- OR -
We note that the points $(2, 3)$, $(7, 15)$, and $(7, 3)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12
This is a Pythagorean triple, so the hypotenuse has length $\boxed{13}$.
Consider the quadratic formula $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
In order for the quadratic to have two non-real roots, the expression under the square root (the discriminant) must be negative
This gives us the inequality \begin{align*} b^2-4ac&<0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad b^2-4(1)(9)&<0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad b^2-36&<0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (b+6)(b-6)&<0.
\end{align*} Thus, we find that $ b\in\boxed{(-6, 6)} $.
The common factor of 3 in the numerator and the common factor of 3 in the denominator will cancel: \[
\frac{3^4+3^2}{3^3-3}=\frac{3(3^3+3^1)}{3(3^2-1)}=\frac{3^3+3^1}{3^2-1}
\] Now the numerator is $3^3+3=27+3=30$, and the denominator is $3^2-1=9-1=8$
Therefore, the fraction simplifies to $\dfrac{30}{8}=\boxed{\dfrac{15}{4}}$.
Since $8=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-3}$ the equation can be rewritten as $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-3(4x-6)}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+5}$
From this equation, we see that $-3(4x-6)=x+5$
Simplifying we get, \begin{align*}
-12x+18&=x+5\\
\Rightarrow -13x+18&=5\\
\Rightarrow -13x&=-13\\
\Rightarrow x&=\boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
For Plan 1, we use the formula $A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the end balance, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the number of years, and $n$ is the number of times compounded in a year.
First we find out how much he would owe in $5$ years
$$A=\$10,\!000\left(1+\frac{0.1}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5} \approx \$16,\!386.16$$He pays off half of it in $5$ years, which is $\frac{\$16,\!386.16}{2}=\$8,\!193.08$ He has $\$8,\!193.08$ left to be compounded over the next $5$ years
This then becomes $$\$8,\!193.08\left(1+\frac{0.1}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5} \approx \$13,\!425.32$$He has to pay back a total of $\$8,\!193.08+\$13,\!425.32=\$21,\!618.40$ in ten years if he chooses Plan 1.
With Plan 2, he would have to pay $\$10,000\left(1+0.1\right)^{10} \approx \$25,\!937.42$ in $10$ years.
Therefore, he should choose Plan 1 and save $25,\!937.42-21,\!618.40=4319.02 \approx \boxed{4319 \text{ dollars}}$.
We rearrange the sum to make it easier to collect like terms: \begin{align*}
&f(x)+g(x)+h(x)\\
&\qquad=(-3x^2+x-4)+(-5x^2+3x-8)\\
&\qquad\qquad+(5x^2+5x+1)\\
&\qquad= (-3-5+5)x^2+(1+3+5)x+(-4-8+1)\\
&\qquad= \boxed{-3x^2 +9x -11}.
\end{align*}
Substituting $f(x)$ into the equation $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - 2x}{2x}$, and noting that $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, we get \[x = \frac{1 - 2f(x)}{2f(x)}.\] Solving for $f(x)$, we get \[f(x) = \frac{1}{2x + 2}.\] Therefore, $b = \boxed{2}$.
Squaring both sides of the given equation, we get \[2 + \sqrt{x} = 9.\]Then, $\sqrt{x} = 9-2 = 7.$ Squaring again gives $x = 49.$
We check our answer by substituting $x = 49$ into the given equation: \[\sqrt{2+\sqrt{x}} = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{49}} = \sqrt{2 + 7} = \sqrt{9} = 3.\]Therefore, $x = \boxed{49}$ is the correct solution
(The step of checking the answer is necessary because squaring both sides of an equation sometimes introduces extraneous roots -- solutions which do not actually satisfy the original equation.)
Let $B$ and $J$ represent the respective ages of Billy and Joe
We can write the equations $B=2J$ and $B+J=45$
We use the second equation to solve for $J$ in terms of $B$ and get $J=45-B$
Now we plug in this expression for $J$ into the first equation
$$B=2(45-B)=90-2B\qquad\Rightarrow 3B=90\qquad\Rightarrow B=30$$ So Billy is $\boxed{30}$ years old.
We are told that $AC = 3CB$, so $AB = AC + CB = 4CB$
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$
Then, we have $BM = \dfrac{AB}{2}$.
Since $AB = 4CB$, we have $CB = \dfrac{AB}{4} = \dfrac{BM}{2}$
In other words, $C$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BM}$.
Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$, we have $M = \left(\dfrac{-1+3}{2} , \dfrac{0+8}{2}\right) = (1,4)$.
Similarly, since $C$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BM}$, we have $C = \left(\dfrac{3 + 1}{2}, \dfrac{8 + 4}{2}\right) = \boxed{(2,6)}$.
Let the leg lengths of the right triangle be $a$ and $b.$ It follows that $\frac{ab}{2}=2(a+b).$ Expanding and moving all the terms to the left hand side, $ab-4a-4b=0.$ Adding 16 to both sides allows us to factor: \[a(b-4)-4(b-4)=(a-4)(b-4)=16
\] From this point, the pairs $(a,b)$ that provide different areas are $(5,20),$ $(6,12),$ and $(8,8),$ and the sum of the possible areas is $50 + 36 + 32 = \boxed{118}$.
At each stop, the number of students on the bus is cut in half
Therefore, after 3 stops, the number of students on the bus is $48(\frac12)^3 = \frac{48}8 = \boxed{6}$.
We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex
Factoring $-3$ from the first two terms, we have \[y=-3(x^2+10x)-81\]In order to make the expression inside the parentheses a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2=25$ inside the parentheses
Doing this, we get \[y=-3(x^2+10x+25-25)-81 = -3(x+5)^2-6\]The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $(-5,-6)$
Thus, $n=\boxed{-6}$.
The original graph consists of the points $(x_1,f(x_1)),$ $(x_2,f(x_2)),$ and $(x_3,f(x_3))$.
The graph of $y=2f(2x)$ consists of the points $\left(\frac{x_1}2,2f(x_1)\right),$ $\left(\frac{x_2}2,2f(x_2)\right),$ and $\left(\frac{x_3}2,2f(x_3)\right)$
Relative to the original graph, it is stretched vertically by a factor of $2$, but also compressed horizontally by the same factor
The vertical transformation doubles the area of the triangle formed by the three points, but the horizontal transformation halves it again, so the final area is equal to the original $\boxed{32}$.
Let the original price of the television be $T$
Then the price is now $0.6(0.6T)=0.36T$
Thus overall the price has been reduced by $1-0.36=\boxed{64\%}$.
The sum of an infinite geometric series with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$ is $\frac{a}{1-r}$
Thus the sum of the first series is
$$\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{2}}$$And the sum of the second series is
$$\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2}}$$Multiplying these, we get
$$\frac{1}{1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}=\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{4}}$$So $x=\boxed{4}$.
In general, two lines intersect in exactly one point, unless they are parallel, in which case they are either the same line or have no intersection points
First, check to see if any of these lines are parallel
The first line $3y-2x=1$ has a slope of $2/3$,  the second line has a slope of $-1/2$, and the third line has a slope of $4/6=2/3$
So, the first and third lines are parallel
We can easily check that these are not the same line
Therefore, these two lines do not intersect anywhere, and the third line intersects each of them in exactly one point, for a total of $\boxed{2}$ intersection points.
First, we can write $\sqrt{108}=6\sqrt{3}$, $2\sqrt{12}=4\sqrt{3}$ and $2\sqrt{27}=6\sqrt{3}$
Substituting these, the expression becomes: $$\frac{4}{6\sqrt{3}+4\sqrt{3}+6\sqrt3}=\frac{4}{16\sqrt{3}}=\frac{1}{4\sqrt{3}}=\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{12}}$$
The equation expands $x^2 - 12x + 36 = 25,$ so $x^2 - 12x + 11 = 0.$  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $\boxed{12}.$
The powers of $i$ repeat every four powers: $i^1=i$, $i^2=-1$, $i^3=-i$, $i^4=1$, $i^5=i$, $i^6=-1$ and so on
So to determine $i^n$, where $n$ is an integer, we only need to find the remainder of $n$ when it is divided by 4
The remainder of both 11 and 111 when divided by 4 is 3, so $i^{11} + i^{111} = i^3 + i^3 = -i + (-i) = \boxed{-2i}$.
Since $$x=\frac{24}{y}=\frac{48}{z}$$ we have $z = 2y$
So $72
= 2y^2$, which implies that $y=6$, $x = 4$, and $z = 12$
Hence $x+y+z = \boxed{22}$.
The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is $2 + 4 + \dots + 40 = 2 (1 + 2 + \dots + 20)$
For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $2 (1 + 2 + \dots + 20) = 20 \cdot 21 = 420$.
Let the four consecutive even integers be $n - 6$, $n - 4$, $n - 2$, and $n$
Their sum is $4n - 12 = 420$, so $n = \boxed{108}$.
Let the side length of the larger square be $x$ and the side length of the smaller square be $y$
We are told $x^2 + y^2 = 65$ and $x^2 - y^2 = 33$
Adding these two equations gives $2x^2 = 98$, so $x^2 = 49$
Since $x$ must be positive, we have $x=7$
Substituting this into either equation above gives us $y^2 = 16$
Since $y$ must be positive, we have $y=4$
The perimeter of the larger square is $4x$ and that of the smaller square is $4y$, so the sum of their perimeters is $4x+4y = 4(x+y) = \boxed{44}$.
Rearranging the terms, we get $32=2\cdot2^x$, or $16=2^x$
Therefore, $x=\boxed{4}$.
Working from the inside out, we start by computing $G(1)$
Since $(1,-3)$ is on the graph, we have $G(1)=-3$.
Therefore, $G(G(1)) = G(-3)$
Since $(-3,5)$ is on the graph, we have $G(G(1))=5$.
Therefore, $G(G(G(1))) = G(5)$
Since $(5,5)$ is on the graph, we have $G(G(G(1)))=5$, and we also see that applying $G$ any number of additional times will leave us at $5$
Therefore, $G(G(G(G(G(1)))))=\boxed{5}$.

Refer to the above diagram
Since the opposite ends of a diameter are symmetric with respect to the center of the circle, we must travel the same distance and direction from $(-1,-1)$ to $(2,3)$ as we do from $(2,3)$ to the other endpoint
To go from $(-1,-1)$ to $(2,3)$ we run $3$ (left dashed red line) and rise $4$ (left dashed blue line), so our other endpoint has coordinates $(2+3,3+4)=\boxed{(5,7)}$.
The common ratio is $\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{2}=\frac{1}{8}$, so the $k^{th}$ term is $2\cdot \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^{k-1}$
Thus we have:
$2\cdot \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^4=\frac{2}{2^{12}}=\frac{1}{2^{11}}=\boxed{\frac{1}{2048}}$.
Factoring, we have $(x+y)(x-y)=51$
Since $x,y$ are positive, we have $x+y>x-y>0$
Note that $51=51*1=17*3$
Thus either $x+y=51$, $x-y=1$ or $x+y=17$, $x-y=3$
Solving in the first case gives $x=26,y=25$, and the second case gives $x=10,y=7$
Thus there are $\boxed{2}$ pairs $(x,y)$ that solve the equation.
After two years, at a four percent annual interest rate, the Jose's investment will have grown to $50000 \cdot 1.04^2 = 54080$
Patricia has the same annual interest rate, but compounded quarterly, so each quarter (or each period of three months), her investment is compounded at the rate of $4/4 = 1$ percent
In two years, there are eight quarters, so Patricia's investment will have grown to $50000 \cdot 1.01^8 = 54143$, to the nearest dollar
The difference is then $54143 - 54080 = \boxed{63}$.
We can rewrite the equation $x^2+12y+57=-y^2-10x$ as $x^2+10x+y^2+12y=-57$
Completing the square, we have $(x+5)^2-25+(y+6)^2-36=-57$, or $(x+5)^2+(y+6)^2=4$
This is the equation of a circle of radius $r=2$ and with center $(a,b)=(-5,-6)$
Therefore, $a+b+r=-5+-6+2=\boxed{-9}$.
The common ratio is $\frac{6x}{2} = 3x$; that is, each term is obtained by multiplying $3x$ to the previous term
The next term is thus $54x^3 \cdot 3x = \boxed{162x^4}$.
We solve each equation separately
First off, we have $8x^2 + 7x - 1 = (8x-1)(x+1) = 0.$ We can also see that $24x^2+53x-7 = (8x-1)(3x+7) = 0.$ It is clear that both equations are satisfied only when $8x - 1 = 0,$ therefore $x = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{8}}.$
Recall that if a function $f$ satisfies $f(x)=f(-x)$ for all real numbers $x$, then it is called an even function
Similarly, if $f(x)=-f(-x)$ for all real numbers $x$, then $f$ is called an odd function
Let's define $g(x)=x^4+x^2$ and $h(x)=5x$
Observe that $g(x)$ is even, $h(x)$ is odd, and $f(x)=g(x)+h(x)$
We have  \begin{align*}
f(5)-f(-5)&=g(5)+h(5)-g(-5)-h(-5) \\
&= (g(5)-g(-5)) + h(5)-h(-5) \\
&= 0 + 2h(5) \\
&= 2(5(5)) \\
&=\boxed{50}.
\end{align*}
Since the cube of $5$ is $125$, we multiply the top and bottom by $\sqrt[3]{\frac{125}{5}}$, which is $\sqrt[3]{25}$
$$\frac{3}{2\sqrt[3]{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{25}}{\sqrt[3]{25}}=$$$$\frac{3\sqrt[3]{25}}{10}$$Therefore, $A+B+C=3+25+10=\boxed{38}$.
We are given that $$\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2} = \sqrt{153 + w^2} = 13.$$Squaring both sides, it follows that $$153 + w^2 = 13^2 = 169 \quad\Longrightarrow \quad w = \pm 4.$$Since the width must be a positive quantity, the answer is $\boxed{4}$.
We first note that the $4^x$ term grows much faster than the other three terms
Indeed, since $x$ is a positive integer, we have: $$4^x < 1^{x+2} + 2^{x+1} + 3^{x-1} + 4^x < 4^x + 4^x + 4^x + 4^x = 4^{x+1}.$$Thus we know that $1170$ lies between $4^x$ and $4^{x+1}$.
The first six powers of $4$ are $4^1=4,$ $4^2=16,$ $4^3=64,$ $4^4=256,$ $4^5 = 1024,$ and $4^6=4096.$
We can see that $1170$ lies between the last two of these, so we check $x=5$ and find: $$1^{x+2} + 2^{x+1} + 3^{x-1} + 4^x = 1 + 64 + 81 +1024 = 1170.$$Therefore, $x=\boxed{5}$.
By the distributive property, we can rewrite this as: $$16\left (\frac{125}{2}+\frac{25}{4}+\frac{9}{16}+1\right) =16\left (\frac{125}{2}\right)+16\left (\frac{25}{4}\right )+16\left (\frac{9}{16} \right) +16$$$$=8\cdot 125+4\cdot 25+9+16=1000+100+9+16=\boxed{1125}.$$
Evaluating the expression in brackets first,$$(1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 =\left( \frac{1 + 2}{1 + 1 \times 2}\right) \nabla 3 = \left(\frac{3}{3}\right) \nabla 3 = 1 \nabla 3 = \frac{1 + 3}{1 + 1 \times 3} = \boxed{1}.$$Note that for any $b>0,$ $$1\nabla b =\frac{1+b}{1+1\times b}=\frac{1+b}{1+b}=1.$$
We start from the inside out
Since $2<4$, $f(2)=2^2=4$
So $f(f(f2)))=f(f(4))$
Since $4 \le 4$, $f(4)=4^2=16$
So $f(f(4)=f(16)$
Since $16>4$, $f(16)=\sqrt{16}=\boxed{4}$.
Observe first that $x=0$ is not a solution to the equation since it makes the denominator of $\frac{1}{2x}$ equal to 0
For $x\neq 0$, we may multiply both sides by both denominators and move all the resulting terms to the left-hand side to get $2x^2-2rx+7=0$
Observe that there are two ways the original equation could have exactly one solution
Either $2x^2-2rx+7=0$ has two solutions and one of them is 0, or else $2x^2-2rx+7=0$ has exactly one nonzero solution
By trying $x=0$, we rule out the first possibility.
Considering the expression $\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the solutions of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we find that there is exactly one solution if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is zero
Setting $(-2r)^2-4(2)(7)$ equal to 0 gives $4r^2-4(14) = 0$
Add 4(14) and divide by 4 to find $r^2=14$
The two solutions of this equation are $\sqrt{14}$ and $-\sqrt{14}$, and their product is $\boxed{-14}$.
We raise both sides to the fourth power, which is equivalent to squaring twice, in order to get rid of the radicals
The left-hand side becomes $$\left(\sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}}\right)^4 = \left(2\sqrt{t-2}\right)^2 = 4 \cdot (t-2) = 4t-8.$$The right-hand side becomes $\left(\sqrt[4]{7-t}\right)^4 = 7-t$
Setting them equal, $$4t-8 = 7-t \quad\Longrightarrow\quad 5t = 15,$$and $t = \boxed{3}$
Checking, we find that this value does indeed satisfy the original equation.
Since 29 is not a perfect square, we know that $\sqrt{29}$ cannot equal an integer
Therefore, $f(\sqrt{29})=\lfloor\sqrt{29}\rfloor+5=5+5=\boxed{10}$.
The graph of the original parabola ($A$) and its final image ($A'$) after rotation and translation is shown below:
Label f;
f.p=fontsize(4);
xaxis(-3,4,Ticks(f, 2.0));
yaxis(-3,7,Ticks(f, 2.0));
real f(real x)
return (x-2)^2+3;
draw("$A$", graph(f,0,4), linewidth(1));
real g(real x)
return -(x+1)^2+1;
draw("$A'$", graph(g,-3,1), linewidth(1));
[/asy]
Rotating the original parabola 180 degrees changes its equation to $y=-(x-2)^2+3$
Shifting this last parabola to the left changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+3$
Shifting it down changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+1$
So the equation of $A'$ is $y=-(x+1)^2+1$
To find the zeros of this parabola, we set $y=0$ to get $0=-(x+1)^2+1$
Expanding the right hand side gives $0=-x^2-2x$
Dividing through by $-1$ and factoring out an $x$ from the right hand side, we get $0=x(x+2)$, so either $x=0$ or $x+2=0$
Thus, $a=0$ and $b=-2$, so $a+b=\boxed{-2}$.
Since the perimeter is 142, the sides of the rectangle add up to $142/2 = 71.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle
Then the other side length is $71 - x,$ so the area is
\[x(71 - x) = 71x - x^2.\]Completing the square, we get
\[-x^2 + 71x = -x^2 + 71x - \frac{71^2}{2^2} + \frac{71^2}{2^2} = \frac{5041}{4} - \left( x - \frac{71}{2} \right)^2.\]To minimize this, we want $x$ as close as possible to $\frac{71}{2}.$  Normally, we could take $x = \frac{71}{2},$ but $x$ must be an integer, so we can take $x$ as either 35 or 36.
Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $35 \cdot 36 = \boxed{1260}.$
First, we note that $r$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lfloor r \rfloor + r$ is nonpositive
Next, we know that the decimal part of $r$ must be $0.5$
We write $r$ as $n+0.5$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $r.$ Therefore, we can write $\lfloor r \rfloor + r$ as $n+n+0.5=16.5$
Solving, we get $n=8$
Therefore, the only value $r$ that satisfies the equation is $8+0.5=\boxed{8.5}$.
Because we cannot divide by zero, values of $x$ that make the denominator of the fraction equal to zero must be excluded from the domain
Thus, we must first find all values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2+6x+8=0$
Since this factors as $(x+4)(x+2)=0$, the only two values we need to exclude from the domain are $-4$ and $-2$
This gives us the solution $x\in\boxed{(-\infty,-4)\cup(-4, -2)\cup(-2,\infty)}$.
We are given that $x + y = 25$ and $xy = 126$ for some numbers $x$ and $y$
We note that \begin{align*}
(x-y)^2&= x^2 - 2xy + y^2\\
&= x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 4xy\\
&= (x + y)^2 - 4xy\\
&= (25)^2 - 4\cdot 126\\
&= 121.
\end{align*}
Thus, we have $(x - y)^2 = 121$
Taking the square root of both sides, we have $\sqrt{(x- y)^2} = |x - y| = \boxed{11}$.
$1<\frac54<2$, so the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\frac54$ is $2$
Similarly, $-2<-\frac54<-1$, so the largest integer less than or equal to $-\frac54$ is $-2$
The original expression, $\left\lceil{\frac54}\right\rceil+\left\lfloor{-\frac54}\right\rfloor$, is equal to the sum of the two, which is just $2+(-2)=\boxed{0}$.
Multiplying the numerators simply yields $1$
Multiplying the denominators gives $1+\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2} -2 = 1 - 2 = -1$
So, the answer is $\frac{1}{-1} = \boxed{-1}$.
To solve for $x$, we wish to eliminate $y$
Multiply the first equation by $2$ and add it to the second: \begin{align*}
(4x-2y) + (x+2y) &= 10+5\\
5x &= 15\\
x &= \boxed{3}
\end{align*}
We rewrite the equation as $x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 2y = 8$ and then complete the square, resulting in  $(x+4)^2-16 + (y-1)^2-1=8$, or $(x+4)^2+(y-1)^2=25$
This is the equation of a circle with center $(-4, 1)$ and radius 5, so the area of this region is $\pi r^2 = \pi (5)^2 = \boxed{25\pi}$.
We have that \begin{align*} f(x) - g(x) &= (3x^2-2x+ 4) - (x^2-kx-6) \\ &= 2x^2 + (k-2)\cdot x +10
\end{align*}So $f(10) - g(10) = 2\cdot 10^2 + (k - 2)\cdot 10 +10 = 10.$ Thus $-2\cdot 10^2 = (k-2)\cdot 10,$ and $k = \boxed{-18}.$
The equation is well-defined unless the denominator of the given expression is equal to $0$, that is $2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$
Factoring, $2(x-1)(x-2) = 0 \Longrightarrow x = 1,2$
Hence, $A+B = \boxed{3}$.
(We can also use Vieta's formulas, which states that the sum of the roots of the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$.)
Because the question only asks for the value of $q$, we can begin by eliminating $p$
In order to do this, we multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3, giving us a system of two equations that both have 12 as the coefficient of $p$ \begin{align*} 12p+16q&=32
\\ 12p+9q&=39
\end{align*}From here, we can just subtract the second equation from the first
This gives us $(12p+16q)-(12p+9q)=32-(39)$, which simplifies to $7q=-7$ or $q=\boxed{-1}$.
The greatest integer less than $17.2$ is $17$, and the greatest integer less than $-17.2$ is $-18$, so our answer is $\boxed{-1}$.
Suppose that a taco costs $t$ dollars and and enchiladas cost $e$ dollars each
Then the given information implies that $2e + 3t = 2.50$ and $3e + 2t = 2.70$
Multiplying the first equation by 3 yields $6e + 9t = 7.50$, and multiplying the second equation by 2 gives $6e + 4t = 5.40$
Subtracting these two equations, we see that $5t = 2.10$
Thus one taco costs $\frac{2.10}{5} = .42$, and two tacos are $.84$
Since we are given the price of three enchiladas and two tacos, we see that three enchiladas and four tacos total $2.70 + .84 = \boxed{\$3.54}$.
Since $f(11)=34$, we know that $f(34)$ is defined, and it must equal $17$
Similarly, we know that $f(17)$ is defined, and it must equal $52$
Continuing on this way,
\begin{align*}
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on
Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined
Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{15}$.
$g(8)=3(8)+7=24+7=31$
Thus, $f(g(8))=f(31)=5(31)-9=155-9=\boxed{146}$.
Each year, the amount of money in the account is multiplied by 1.1
Therefore, after 3 years the amount of money is $1000(1.1)^3=11^3=1331$ dollars
The interest earned is $1331-1000=\boxed{331}$ dollars.
We have: $$3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 $$$$\Rightarrow 9 < 2x < 16 $$$$\Rightarrow 4.5 < x < 8$$The integers from 5 to 7 inclusive satisfy this inequality, so there are $\boxed{3}$ integers that satisfy the condition.
The $x$-axis has equation $y = 0$
Thus we need to find out what $x$ is when $y = 0$
We notice that the slope of the line is $\frac{9 - 5}{1 - 5} = -1$
So to get to $y = 1$ we can start at $(9, 1)$ and go down one in the $y$ direction
Since the slope of the line is $-1$ we know that going down in $y$ by one results in going up in $x$ by one (i.e
$x$ will be 10)
Thus the line intercepts the $x$-axis at $\boxed{(10, 0)}$.
We have two inequalities which $c$ must satisfy
We consider these inequalities one at a time.
The first inequality is $\frac{c}{3}\le 2+c$
Multiplying both sides by $3$, we have $$c\le 6+3c.$$Subtracting $3c$ from both sides gives $$-2c\le 6.$$We can divide both sides by $-2$, but we must reverse the inequality since $-2$ is negative
This gives $c\ge -3$.
The second inequality is $2+c < -2(1+c)$
Expanding the right side, we have $$2+c < -2-2c.$$Adding $2c-2$ to both sides gives $$3c<-4.$$Dividing both sides by $3$ gives $c<-\frac{4}{3}$.
So, all $c$ which satisfy both inequalities are given by $-3\le c<-\frac{4}{3}$, or, in interval notation, $c\in\boxed{\left[-3,-\frac{4}{3}\right)}$.
We can solve for $x$ and $y$, then plug them in to get our answer
However, there is a nicer method
Note that \begin{align*}
5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2 &= (4x^2 + 4xy + y^2) + (x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2) \\
&= (2x + y)^2 + (x + 2y)^2 = 4^2 + 5^2 = \boxed{41}.
\end{align*}.
Because the point for which we are looking is on the $y$-axis, we know that it is of the form $(0,y)$
We apply the distance formula
The distance from A is  \[\sqrt{(-2-0)^2+(0-y)^2} = \sqrt{y^2+4}\]The distance from B is  \[\sqrt{(-1-0)^2 + (4-y)^2} = \sqrt{y^2-8y+17}\]Because the point is equidistant from $A$ and $B$, we set the two distances equal: $y^2-8y+17 = y^2 + 4$
Simplifying gives us $8y=13$, or $y = \boxed{\frac{13}{8}}$.
Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we have \begin{align*}
\frac{2+2i}{-3+4i} \cdot \frac{-3-4i}{-3-4i} &= \frac{2(-3) + 2(-4i) - 3(2i) + 2i(-4i)}{-3(-3) -3(4i) + 3(4i) -4i(4i)} \\
&= \frac{2-14i}{25} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{2}{25} - \frac{14}{25}i}.
\end{align*}
Let $y = x - 2,$ so $1 < y^2 < 25.$  Then the integer solutions to $y$ are $-4,$ $-3,$ $-2, 2, 3, 4,$ so the solutions in $x$ are $-4 + 2 = -2,$ $-3 + 2 = -1,$ $-2 + 2 = 0,$ $2 + 2 = 4,$ $3 + 2 = 5,$ and $4 + 2 = 6.$  Their sum is $(-2) + (-1) + 0 + 4 + 5 + 6 = \boxed{12}.$
Dividing both sides by $x$ (noting that $x\ne0$), we have $x-2=0$ and so $x=\boxed{2}$.
Since Laura spends $5$ minutes in transition, a total of $110-5=105$ minutes are spent in motion
This is equivalent to $\frac{105}{60}=1.75$ hours
We know that $\text{distance}=\text{rate}\cdot\text{time}$, so $\text{time}=\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{rate}}$
Thus the time Laura spends biking is $\frac{20\text{ miles}}{2x+1\text{ mph}}=\frac{20}{2x+1}\text{ hours}$, and the time she spends running is $\frac{5\text{ miles}}{x\text{ mph}}=\frac{5}{x}\text{ hours}$
Thus the total time Laura is in motion is $$\frac{20}{2x+1}\text{ hours}+\frac{5}{x}\text{ hours}=1.75\text{ hours}.$$We can solve this equation by multiplying through by a common denominator: \begin{align*}
(x)(2x+1)\left(\frac{20}{2x+1}+\frac{5}{x}\right)&=(1.75)(x)(2x+1)\\
20(x)+5(2x+1)&=\frac{7}{4}(2x^2+x)\\
20x+10x+5&=\frac{14x^2+7x}{4}\\
4(30x+5)&=14x^2+7x\\
120x+20&=14x^2+7x\\
0&=14x^2-113x-20.
\end{align*}We can solve this using the quadratic formula, by writing  \begin{align*}
x&=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\
&=\frac{-(-113)\pm\sqrt{(-113)^2-4(14)(-20)}}{2(14)}\\
&=\frac{113\pm\sqrt{13889}}{28}.
\end{align*}The two solutions are approximately $-0.1733$ and $8.2447$
Since Laura isn't running at a negative speed, she runs $\boxed{\approx 8.24 \text{ mph}}$.
If the degree of $h(x)$ is $9,$ that means there is a $x^9$ term in $h(x).$ That term cannot come from $f(x),$ since its degree is $8,$ so it must come from $g(x).$ That means the degree of $g(x)$ has to be at least $\boxed{9},$ and indeed, it can only be $9.$
Over the course of $1996-1960=36$ years, the number of cases of measles decreased by $450,\!000-500=449,\!500$
So, over the course of $1987-1960=27$, the number of cases would decrease by $\frac{27}{36}\cdot(449,\!500)=337,\!125$ cases
Therefore, the number of cases in 1987 would be $450,\!000-337,\!125=\boxed{112,\!875}$ if the number of cases decreased linearly.
The greatest integer that is less than or equal to $0.999$ is $0$, so $\lfloor0.999\rfloor=0$
The smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $2.001$ is $3$, so $\lceil2.001\rceil=3$
Therefore, $\lfloor0.999\rfloor+\lceil2.001\rceil=0+3=\boxed{3}$.
Note that $(x+4)(y+5)$ equals $xy+5x+4y+20$
So, add $20$ to both sides of the original equation to get $xy+5x+4y+20=15$, so now we may apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and write the equation as $(x+4)(y+5)=15$.
Then, the potential ordered pairs $((x+4),(y+5))$ with $x<y$ are $(-15,-1)$, $(-5,-3)$, $(1,15)$ and $(3,5)$, since these are the pairs of integers that multiply to 15
The greatest value for $y+5$ is thus $15$
We solve $y+5=15$ for $y$ to yield $y=\boxed{10}$.
Inputting $f^{-1}(x)$ into $f$, we have $f(f^{-1}(x)) =4f^{-1}(x) + 5$, so $x = 4f^{-1}(x) + 5$
Solving this equation for $f^{-1}(x)$, we get that $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x-5}{4}$
Thus, we have  \begin{align*}
f^{-1}(f^{-1}(9)) & = f^{-1}\left(\frac{9-5}{4}\right) \\
& = f^{-1}(1) \\
& = \frac{1-5}{4} \\
& = \boxed{-1}.
\end{align*}
We know that $(ax + b)^2 + c = (a^2)x^2 + (2ab)x + b^2 + c,$ meaning that if this to equal $9x^2 - 30x - 42$, we start with $a^2 = 9,$ and so we let $a = 3.$ Then, $2ab = -30,$ so $b = -5.$ We do not need to find $c$ in this case, so our answer is $ab = \boxed{-15}.$
Note: Letting $a = -3$ gives us $(-3x+5)^2 + c,$ which gives us the same answer.
We start off by simplifying the ratio $\frac{192}{80}$ to $\frac{12}{5}$
The area of a square equals the side length squared, so we can get the ratio of sidelengths by taking the square root of the ratio of areas: $$\sqrt{\frac{12}{5}}=\frac{\sqrt{12}}{\sqrt{5}}=\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5}}=\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}}=\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}.$$So, our answer is $2+15+5=\boxed{22}$
If you started off by taking the square root of $\frac{192}{80}$ directly without simplifying it first, you still get the same answer
$$\sqrt{\frac{192}{80}}=\frac{\sqrt{192}}{\sqrt{80}}=\frac{8\sqrt{3}}{4\sqrt{5}}=\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5}}=\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}.$$
Clearly $C$ must be the midpoint of $AB$ if $C$ is the closest point to both $A$ and $B.$ Using the midpoint formula, we see that: $$\left(\frac{1 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2}\right) = \left(3, 5\right).$$Therefore, $\frac{1 + x}{2} = 3$, so $x = 5.$ Meanwhile, $\frac{8 + y}{2} = 5$, so $y = 2$
Our answer is $xy = \boxed{10}.$
We don't know $g(x)$, so we don't have an expression we can simply stick $25$ in to get an answer
We do, however, know that $g(f(x)) =x^2 + x + 1$
So, if we can figure out what to put into $f(x)$ such that $25$ is the resulting output, we can use our expression for $g(f(x))$ to find $g(25)$.
If $f(x) = 25$, then we have $3x^2 - 2 = 25$, so $x^2 = 9$, which means $x=3$ or $x=-3$
Since $x$ could be $3$ or $-3$, we could have $g(25) = g(f(3))$ or $g(25) = g(f(-3))$
Using the given expression for $g(f(x))$, the two possible values of $g(25)$ are  $g(f(3)) = 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 13$ and $g(f(-3)) = (-3)^2 + (-3) + 1 = 7$
The sum of these is $13+7=\boxed{20}$.
f(g(2))=f\left(2^2\right)=f(4)=2\cdot4-1=\boxed{7}
If you call the number of bounces $b$, then this problem can be phrased as: what is the minimum $b$, such that $243\cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^b < 30 \rightarrow \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^b < \frac{30}{243}$, at which point you can take the logarithm of both sides and solve for it exactly, but given that you can use your calculator, it's much easier to just multiply $\frac{2}{3}$ with itself repeatedly until the product is less than $\frac{30}{243}$
Regardless of how you do it, you will get $b = \boxed{6}$.
Because $\pi$ is greater than $3$ but less than $4$,
$-1<\pi - 4<0$
Therefore, $[\pi - 4]$ is $\boxed{-1}$
\[h(x)=f(g(x))=3(2x-3)+4=6x-5.\]Let's replace $h(x)$ with $y$ for simplicity, so \[y=6x-5.\]In order to invert $h(x)$ we may solve this equation for $x$
That gives \[y+5=6x\]or  \[x=\frac{y+5}{6}.\]Writing this in terms of $x$ gives the inverse function of $h$ as  \[h^{-1}(x)=\boxed{\frac{x+5}{6}}.\]
The $x^3$ term is gotten by adding the cubic terms of each of the expressions in the sum
These cubic terms are  \[3(-x^3)+3(2x^3+x^3)-5(-4x^3)=(-3+9+20)x^3=26x^3.\]The coefficient of $x^3$ is $\boxed{26}$.
The discriminant of the quadratic is $7^2-4(13)=-3<0$, so the quadratic has no real roots and is always positive for real inputs
The function is undefined if $0\leq x^2-7x+13<1$, since $\lfloor x^2-7x+13 \rfloor = 0$ in that case
Since the quadratic is always positive, we consider the inequality $x^2-7x+13<1$.
To find when $x^2-7x+13=1$, subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $x^2-7x+12=0$ and factor as $(x-3)(x-4)=0$, so $x=3$ or $x=4$
The parabola $x^2-7x+12$ is negative between these points, so we must exclude the interval $(3,4)$ from the domain
So the domain of $f$ is $\boxed{(-\infty,3] \cup [4,\infty)}$.
We must find the radius of the circle in order to find the area
We are told that points $A$ and $B$ are the endpoints of a diameter, so we can find the distance between these two points
We use the distance formula: $\sqrt{(7-3)^2 + (10-5)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 25} = \sqrt{41}$.
Since the diameter has a length of $\sqrt{41}$, the radius must have length $\sqrt{41}/2$
Therefore, the answer is $(\sqrt{41}/2)^2\pi = \boxed{\frac{41\pi}{4}}$.
Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\frac{1}{2}\cdot24=12$ minutes
Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\cdot5=\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles.
We have $f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 1 = 1-1 = \boxed{0}$.
Looking at the table, we see that increasing $x$ by two results in an increase in $y$ of $6.$ Thus for every increase in $x$ of $1,$ $y$ increases by $3.$ If $x = 1$ gives $y = 7,$ then $x = 28 = 1 + 27$ gives $y = 7 + 27\cdot 3 = \boxed{88}.$
Expanding the square on the left, we have $64- 16x + x^2 = x^2$
The $x^2$ terms cancel and leave $64-16x = 0$, so $x = \boxed{4}$.
This is a finite geometric series with first term 1, common ratio 2 and 11 terms
Thus the sum is: $$\frac{1(1-2^{11})}{1-2} = \frac{1-2^{11}}{-1} = 2^{11}-1 = 2048-1 = \boxed{2047}.$$
We have $f(3) = 3(3) + 1 = \boxed{10}$.
Note that $|{-17 + 3}| = |{-14}| = 14$
Thus we must solve $2x + 4 = 14$, which is the same as $2x = 10$, or $x = \boxed{5}$.
A function will have a vertical asymptote where the denominator equals zero and the degree of that root is greater than the degree of the same root in the numerator
Here, the denominator is zero at $x = 4.$  The degree of this root is 1
The number has no root at $x = 4$ (degree 0), so there is a vertical asymptote at $x=\boxed{4}$.
Let point $B$ have coordinates $(x,y)$
We have the equations $(x+9)/2=3$ and $(y+3)/2=7$, or $x=-3$ and $y=11$
Thus, the sum of coordinates of point $B$ is $-3+11=\boxed{8}$.
Let $y=5x^2 -20x + 1357$
First, complete the square as follows: $y=5x^2-20x+1357=5(x^2-4x)+1357$
To complete the square, we need to add $\left(\dfrac{4}{2}\right)^2=4$ after the $-4x$
So we have $y+20=5\left(x^2-4x+4\right)+1357$
This gives $y=5\left(x-2\right)^2+1337$.
Now, since $\left(x-2\right)^2\ge0$, the minimum value is when the squared term is equal to $0$
So the minimum value is $y=5\left(x-2\right)^2+1337=5\cdot0+1337=\boxed{1337}$.
The first equation becomes
$$\frac{x+y}{xy}=3\Rightarrow x+y=3xy$$
Substituting into the second equation,
$$4xy=4\Rightarrow xy=1$$
Thus $x+y=3$.
The quantity we desire factors as $xy(x+y)$, so it is equal to $1(3)=\boxed{3}$.
The equation can be rewritten as \begin{align*}
x^2-14x+y^2-8y & =-49\\
x^2-14x+49+y^2-8y+16& =16\\
(x-7)^2+(y-4)^2 & =16
\end{align*}Thus, the region is a circle with center $(7,4)$ and radius 4
As $(7,4)$ is on the line $y=x-3$, the line passes through the center of the circle
Hence, half of the area of the circle lies below the line $y=x-3$
The radius of the circle is 4, so the circle has area $16\pi$
Therefore, half the area of the circle is $\boxed{8 \pi}$.
Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find $3^x=81$
Since the fourth power of 3 is 81, $x=\boxed{4}$.
We know that $\left(\frac{13}{7}\right)^2=\frac{169}{49}$
Then, since $3=\frac{147}{49}<\frac{169}{49}<\frac{196}{49}=4$, we conclude that $\left\lceil\left(\frac{13}{7}\right)^2\right\rceil=4$
Because $4+\frac{17}{4}=\frac{33}{4}$, which is a number between $8$ and $9$, $\left\lfloor \left\lceil \left(\frac{13}{7}\right)^2\right\rceil+\frac{17}{4}\right\rfloor=\boxed{8}$.
The graph of the two parabolas is shown below:
Label f;
f.p=fontsize(4);
xaxis(-2,2,Ticks(f, 1.0));
yaxis(-2,5,Ticks(f, 1.0));
real f(real x)
return 2x^2-4x+4;
draw(graph(f,-.2,2),linewidth(1));
real g(real x)
return -x^2-2x+4;
draw(graph(g,-2,1.5),linewidth(1));
[/asy]
The graphs intersect when $y$ equals both $2x^2 -4x + 4$ and $-x^2 -2x + 4$, so we have $2x^2-4x+4=-x^2-2x+4$
Combining like terms, we get $3x^2-2x=0$
Factoring out a $x$, we have $x(3x-2)=0$
So either $x=0$ or $3x-2=0\Rightarrow x=2/3$, which are the two $x$ coordinates of the points of intersection
Thus, $c=2/3$ and $a=0$, and $c-a=\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $1 + 2 + \dots + 102 = 102 \cdot 103/2 = 5253$
The remainder when 5253 is divided by 5250 is $\boxed{3}$.
We have $g(-2) = (-2-1)^2 = 9$, so $f(g(-2)) = f(9) = 3(9) +2 = \boxed{29}$.
We have  \begin{align*}f(-2) &= 8(-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 -4(-2) + 5\\
& = 8(-8) -6(4) +8 + 5 = -64 -24 +8+5 = \boxed{-75}.\end{align*}
The bank account compounds monthly at an interest rate of $6/12 = 0.5$ percent
Therefore, in the course of a year, the bank account compounds annually at a rate of $1.005^{12} = 1.061678 \dots$
To the nearest hundredth, the interest rate is $\boxed{6.17}$ percent.
Let $a$ be the number of pennies that Alex currently has, and let $b$ be the number of pennies that Bob currently has
If Alex gives Bob a penny, Alex will have $a - 1$ pennies and Bob will have $b + 1$ pennies
Also, Bob will have three times as many pennies as Alex has, so $b + 1 = 3(a - 1) = 3a - 3$
If Bob gives Alex a penny, Alex will have $a + 1$ pennies and Bob will have $b - 1$ pennies
Also, Bob will have twice as many pennies as Alex has, so $b - 1 = 2(a + 1) = 2a + 2$.
If we subtract the second equation from the first, we obtain $2 = a - 5$, so $a = 7$
Plugging this in, we can find that $b = 17$, so Bob has $\boxed{17}$ pennies.
Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins
The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1
He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12
The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\cdots+12 = \frac{12 \cdot 13}{2}=78$
Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\boxed{15}$ more coins.
Let the length of the backyard be $l$ and the width be $w$
We have the equation $l+2w=360$
We want to maximize the area of this rectangular backyard, which is given by $lw$
From our equation, we know that $l=360-2w$
Substituting this into our expression for area, we have \[(360-2w)(w)=360w-2w^2\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression
Factoring a $-2$ out, we have \[-2(w^2-180w)\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(180/2)^2=8100$ inside the parenthesis
Doing this, we get \[-2(w^2-180w+8100-8100) \Rightarrow -2(w-90)^2+16200\]Since the maximum value of $-2(w-90)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 16200, which is achieved when $w=90$ and $l=360-2w=180$
Thus, the maximum area of the backyard is $\boxed{16200}$ square feet.
We rewrite the equation as $x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0$
The sum of the solutions to this equation are $-\frac{-7}{1} = \boxed{7}$.
The fact that 60 workers produce 240 widgets and 300 whoosits in two hours implies that 100 workers produce 400 widgets and 500 whoosits in two hours, or 200 widgets and 250 whoosits in one hour
Let $a$ be the time required for a worker to produce a widget, and let $b$ be the time required for a worker to produce a whoosit
Then $300a + 200b = 200a + 250b$, which is equivalent to $b = 2a$
In three hours, 50 workers produce 300 widgets and 375 whoosits, so $150a + mb = 300a + 375b$ and $150a + 2ma = 300a + 750a$
Solving the last equation yields $m = \boxed{450}$.
Note that $f(x)$ is defined if and only if $x\ge 3$.
Thus $f(f(x)) = f(\sqrt{x-3})$ is defined if and only if $$\sqrt{x-3}\ge 3.$$ This is true if and only if $$x-3\ge 3^2,$$ or equivalently, if $x\ge 12$
So the smallest real number for which $f(f(x))$ is defined is $\boxed{12}$.
By Vieta's formulas, $d + e = -\frac{3}{2}$ and $de = -\frac{5}{2},$ so
\[(d - 1)(e - 1) = de - (d + e) + 1 = -\frac{5}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 1 = \boxed{0}.\]
By the distance formula, the distance between the origin and $(3\sqrt{5},d+3)$ is $\sqrt{(3\sqrt{5})^2+(d+3)^2}$
Setting this equal to $3d$, we have  \begin{align*}
9d^2&=(3\sqrt{5})^2+(d+3)^2\\
9d^2&=45+d^2+6d+9\\
8d^2-6d-54&=0\\
4d^2-3d-27&=0\\
(4d+9)(d-3)&=0
\end{align*}Thus, the values of $d$ are $-\frac{9}{4}$ and $3$
We find that $-\frac{9}{4}$ is an extraneous answer (since distance cannot be negative), so our answer is $d=\boxed{3}$.
Rewrite $2^{3x}$ as $(2^3)^x=8^x$
Multiply both sides of $8^x=7$ by 8 to find that $8^{x+1}=7\cdot 8=\boxed{56}$.
We take the ratio of consecutive terms: $\cfrac{\cfrac{-5}{3}}{\cfrac{-3}{5}}=\frac{-5}{3}\cdot \frac{-5}{3}=\boxed{\frac{25}{9}}$.
We have $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 2^{30} = \frac{2^{30}}{2^2} = 2^{30-2} = 2^{28}$
We also have $4^{x} = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x}$
Setting these equal gives $2^{28} = 2^{2x}$, so $2x =28$, which means $x = \boxed{14}$.
We can have $\log_{10}100=2$ and $\log_{10}1000=3$
Since $\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\log_{10}100<\log_{10}579<\log_{10}1000$, meaning $2<\log_{10}579<3$
Thus, the desired sum is $2+3=\boxed{5}$.
We note that $j(x)$ is defined unless one or more of the denominators $x+8,~x^2+8,~x^3+8$ is equal to $0$.
We have $x+8=0$ if $x=-8$, and $x^3+8$ if $x=\sqrt[3]{-8} = -2$
There is no real $x$ for which $x^2+8=0$
Therefore, the domain of $j(x)$ consists of all real $x$ except $-8$ and $-2$
As a union of intervals, this is $\boxed{(-\infty,-8)\cup (-8,-2)\cup (-2,\infty)}$.
Suppose that there are $a$ ants of Species A and $b$ ants of Species B on Day 0
We thus have that $a+b=30$
Notice that on Day 1, there will be $2a$ ants of Species A, on Day 2, there will be $2(2a) = 4a$ ants of Species A, and on Day 3, there will be $2(4a)=8a$ ants of Species A, etc
Following this line of reasoning, on Day 5, there will be $2^5a$ ants of Species A and $3^5b$ ants of Species B, meaning that $32a+243b=3281$
We now solve this system of linear equations
We have that $32a+32b=960$, so \begin{align*}(32a+243b)-(32a+32b) &= 211b \\
&= 3281-960 \\
&= 2321.\end{align*}We then have $b = \frac{2321}{211} = 11$
This means that $a=30-11=19$, and there are $32\cdot 19 = \boxed{608}$ ants of Species A on Day 5.
$(5-4i)-2(3+6i) = 5-4i -6 -12i = \boxed{-1-16i}$.
Since the square of any real number is nonnegative, the greatest possible value of $-x^2$ is 0, which is achieved when $x=0$
Therefore, the greatest possible value of $y = -x^2 + 5$ is $\boxed{5}$, which is achieved when $x=0$.
We see that the expression is equal to $3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = \boxed{40}$.
Margo walked for a total of $10+20=30$ minutes, or 0.5 hours
To find the total distance traveled, we can multiply the total time by the rate: \begin{align*}
\text{distance}&=\text{rate}\times \text{time} \\
&=0.5\times 4 \\
&=\boxed{2}\text{ miles}.
\end{align*}
We approach this problem by trying to find solutions to the equation $pq - 4p - 2q = 2$
To do this, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $8$ to both sides to get $pq - 4p - 2q + 8 = 10$
This can be factored into $$(p-2)(q-4)=10$$  We now can see that there are solutions only if $p-2$ divides $10$
Thus, there are $4$ possible values of $p$ between $1$ and $10$ inclusive $(1,3,4 \text{ and } 7)$
It follows that the probability of picking such a $p$ is $\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.
We use the distance formula to find that the distance is \[\sqrt{(-5 -7)^2 + (-2-3)^2} = \!\sqrt{144 + 25} = \boxed{13}.\]
Let the longer side have length $a$ and the shorter side have length $b$
We have the two equations \begin{align*}
2a+2b&=42\\
ab&=108
\end{align*} From Equation (1), we have $a+b=21$, so $a=21-b$
Substituting that into Equation (2) to eliminate $a$, we get \begin{align*}
(21-b)(b)&=108\\
21b-b^2&=108\\
b^2-21b+108&=0
\end{align*} Factoring the equation, we get $(b-9)(b-12)=0$, so $b=9$ or $b=12$
$b=12$ corresponds to the longer side, so the length of the shorter side is $\boxed{9}$ feet.
Each group of 4 consecutive powers of $i$ adds to 0: $i + i^2 + i^3 + i^4 = i - 1 - i +1 = 0$, $i^5+i^6+i^7+i^8 = i^4(i+i^2+i^3+i^4) = 1(0) = 0$, and so on
Because 600 is divisible by 4, we know that if we start grouping the powers of $i$ as suggested by our first two groups above, we won't have any `extra' powers of $i$ beyond $i^{600}$
We will, however, have the extra 1 before the $i$, so: \[i^{600} + i^{599} + \cdots + i + 1 = (0) + (0) + \cdots + (0) + 1 = \boxed{1}.\]
Let the two integers be $x$ and $y$
We are given that $x^2 + y^2 = 193$ and that $xy = 84$
We want to find $x + y$
Note that $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = 193 + 2\cdot 84 = 361$
Taking the square root of 361, we see that $x + y = \boxed{19}$.
Let the numbers be $x$ and $y$
The problem translates into a system of equations: \begin{align*}
x+y &= 19\\
x-y &= 5.
\end{align*} Adding the equations, we obtain $x+y+x-y = 24$, which implies $2x = 24$
Therefore, $x = 12$
Subtracting the equations, we obtain $(x+y)-(x-y) = 14$, which implies $2y = 14$
Therefore, $y = 7$
Our desired product is $xy = 12\cdot7 =\boxed{84}$.
If all the page numbers were added just once, the sum would be \[1 + 2 + \dots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.\]But one of the page numbers was added twice, so the interval of possible values for the incorrect sum is $\left[\tfrac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1, \tfrac{n(n+1)}{2} + n\right].$ We are given that the incorrect sum is $1986,$ so we must have \[\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 \le 1986 \le \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n.\]We look for the value of $n$ which satisfies this inequality chain
We have $\tfrac{n(n+1)}{2} \approx 1986 \approx 2000,$ so $n(n+1) \approx n^2 \approx 4000,$ and $n \approx \sqrt{4000} \approx 63.$ For $n = 63,$ we have $\tfrac{n(n+1)}{2} = 2016,$ which is too large
For $n=62,$ we have $\tfrac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1953,$ which works, because \[1953 + 1 \le 1986 \le 1953 + 62.\]Then, the page number that was added twice must be \[1986 - 1953 = \boxed{33}.\]
Since it takes June 4 minutes to travel 1 mile, it takes her $4\times3.5=\boxed{14}$ minutes to travel 3.5 miles.
We could find the value of $f(g(x))+g(f(x))$ in terms of $x$ and then plug in $1$, but it's simpler to plug in $1$ from the start
$f(1)=\frac{3+5+8}{1-1+4}=\frac{16}{4}=4$, and $g(1)=1-1=0$, so $f(g(1))+g(f(1))=f(0)+g(4)$
Now $g(4)=4-1=3$, and $f(0)=\frac{0+0+8}{0+0+4}=2$, so we have $f(0)+g(4)=2+3=\boxed{5}$.
We seek the number $z$ such that $3-5i + z = 2+7i$, so $z = 2+7i-3+5i = \boxed{-1+12i}$.
If we multiply the first equation by $-3$, we obtain
$$3y-6x=-3a.$$Since we also know that $3y-6x=b$, we have
$$-3a=b\Rightarrow\frac{a}{b}=\boxed{-\frac{1}{3}}.$$
The common difference of the arithmetic sequence is $7-2=5$
Therefore, the first six terms of the sequence are 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, and 27
The sum of $a$ and $b$ is $17+22=\boxed{39}$.
The value $x=f^{-1}(58)$ is the solution to $f(x)=58$
This means \[2x^3+4=58.\]Subtracting 4 gives \[2x^3=54.\]If we divide by 2 we get  \[x^3=27,\]and the only value that solves this equation is  \[x=\boxed{3}.\]
Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=103$
With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 104$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=104$
We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $104$: $(104,1), (52,2), (26,4), (13,8)$
Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 3 pairs, which gives $a=12$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\boxed{19}$.
We can split the expression $|3x+7|=26$ into two separate cases: $3x+7=26$ and $3x+7=-26$
For the first case, solving for $x$ would give us $x=\frac{26-7}{3}=\frac{19}{3}$
For the second case, we would get $x=\frac{-26-7}{3}=\frac{-33}{3}=-11$
Therefore, $x=\frac{19}{3}$ and $x=-11$ both satisfy the equation
Since the problem asks for the smallest value of $x$, our solution is $\boxed{-11}$.
First, $b$ must be positive since $b+\lceil b\rceil$ has a positive solution
Because $\lceil b\rceil$ must be an integer, $0.8$ must be the decimal component of $b$
Therefore, $b$ can be rewritten as $a+0.8$
$\lceil b\rceil$ must then equal $a+1$
The original equation is then as follows: \begin{align*}
b+\lceil b\rceil&=17.8\\
a+0.8+a+1&=17.8\\
2a+1.8&=17.8\\
2a&=16\\
\end{align*}Therefore, $b=a+0.8=\boxed{8.8}$.
For a quadratic to have only one solution, the discriminant must be zero
Therefore, we have $(-12)^2-4 \cdot p \cdot 4 = 0$
Solving, we get $(-12)^2-4 \cdot p \cdot 4 = 144-16p = 0$
Thus, $144=16p$, so $p=\boxed{9}$.
We first evaluate $g(3) = 2\cdot3^2 - 2\cdot3-3=9$
Therefore $f(g(3))=f(9)=2\sqrt{9} + \frac{12}{\sqrt{9}}= 2\cdot3 + \frac{12}{3}=\boxed{10}$.
The area the dog can go in is a circle of radius $10$ centered at the point $(4,3)$
The point farthest from $(0,0)$ in the circle would be the point on the circle's circumference which is on the same diameter as $(0,0)$ but on the other side of the center of the circle.
The distance from the origin to the center of the circle, by the distance formula, is $\sqrt{(4-0)^2+(3-0)^2}=\sqrt{16+9}=5$
As the radius of the circle is $10$, the distance from the origin to the point in the circle farthest from the origin is $\boxed{15}$.
Writing everything in terms of prime factorizations, the given expression is $\sqrt{2 \cdot 3\cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot p^3} = \sqrt{(2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot p^2) \cdot (p)} = \boxed{30p \sqrt{p}}$.
We have $x-\sqrt[5]{16}=3$ or $x-\sqrt[5]{16}=-3$
Our two solutions are $x=\sqrt[5]{16}+3$ and $x=\sqrt[5]{16}-3$
These are the endpoints of the segment, and we need to find the length, so take the larger minus the smaller: $(\sqrt[5]{16}+3)-(\sqrt[5]{16}-3)=\boxed{6}$.
The number of squares in the rectangles is an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 1
Thus, at Stage 6, there will be 6 squares
Since each square has an area of $3 \cdot 3 = 9$ square inches, the total area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is $6 \cdot 9 = \boxed{54}$ square inches.
We know that $7\bowtie g = 7+\sqrt{g+\sqrt{g+\sqrt{g+...}}}=9$
Therefore, $$\sqrt{g+\sqrt{g+\sqrt{g+...}}}=2.$$ Because the series of $\sqrt{g+\sqrt{g+\sqrt{g+...}}}$ is infinite, we can substitute $2$ into the series for any $\sqrt{g+\sqrt{g+\sqrt{g+...}}}$ we want
Thus, $$\sqrt{g+\sqrt{g+\sqrt{g+...}}}=2$$ implies that $$\sqrt{g+\sqrt{g+\sqrt{g+...}}}=\sqrt{g+2}=2.$$ Squaring both sides of this new equality, we have $g+2=4$, or $g=\boxed{2}$.
Let the weights of Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively
We have the equations \begin{align*}
a+b&=260\\
b+c&=245\\
c+d&=270
\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have $(a+b)-(b+c)=260-245 \Rightarrow a-c=15$
Adding this last equation to the third given equation, we have $(a-c)+(c+d)=15+270 \Rightarrow a+d=285$
Thus, Abby and Damon together weigh $\boxed{285}$ pounds.
First substitute $n=2$ into the expression for $s$ to find $s=2^2+1=5$
Then substitute $s=5$ into the expression for $r$ to find $r=3^5-5=243-5=\boxed{238}$.
Let the side lengths of the rectangle be $a$ and $b.$ It follows that $ab=4(a+b).$ Expanding and moving all the terms to the left hand side, $ab-4a-4b=0.$ Adding 16 to both sides allows us to factor:
\[a(b-4)-4(b-4)=(a-4)(b-4)=16
\]From this point, the pairs $(a,b)$ that provide different areas are $(5,20),$ $(6,12),$ and $(8,8),$ and the sum of the possible areas is $\boxed{236}.$
The number of feet the car travels in each second is an arithmetic sequence with first term 28 and common difference $-7$
We are summing all the positive terms in this sequence (these terms represent the number of feet the car travels in each second)
Thus, we want to find the sum $28+21+14+7 = \boxed{70}$.
We begin by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation and subtracting $-43+jx$ from both sides
We get $2x^2+(-3-j)x+8=0$
For this quadratic to have exactly one real root, the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ must be equal to $0$
Thus, we require $(-3-j)^2-4(2)(8) = 0$
Solving, we get that $j=\boxed{5,\,-11}$.
We can factor the quadratics in the numerators on the left side, and lo and behold, we can simplify the fractions: \begin{align*} \frac{y^2 - 9y + 8}{y-1} + \dfrac{3y^2 +16y-12 }{3y -2} &= \frac{\cancel{(y-1)}(y-8)}{\cancel{y-1}} + \frac{\cancel{(3y-2)}(y+6)}{\cancel{3y-2}} \\ &= y-8 + y+6
\end{align*}So, our equation is $2y-2 = -3$, which gives $y =\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}$
(A quick check shows that this solution is not extraneous.)
Each group of 4 consecutive powers of $i$ adds to 0: $i + i^2 + i^3 + i^4 = i - 1 - i +1 = 0$, $i^5+i^6+i^7+i^8 = i^4(i+i^2+i^3+i^4) = 1(0) = 0$, and so on for positive powers of $i$
Similarly, we note that $i^{-4} = \frac1{i^4} = \frac11 = 1$
Then $i^{-4}+i^{-3}+i^{-2}+i^{-1} = 1+1\cdot i+1\cdot{-1} + 1\cdot{-i} = 0$, $i^{-8}+i^{-7}+i^{-6}+i^{-5}=i^{-4}(i^{-4}+i^{-3}+i^{-2}+i^{-1}) = 0$, and so on for negative powers of $i$
Because 100 is divisible by 4, we group the positive powers of $i$ into 25 groups with zero sum
Similarly, we group the negative powers of $i$ into 25 groups with zero sum
Therefore, $$i^{-100}+i^{-99}+\cdots+i^{99}+i^{100} = 25\cdot0+i^0+25\cdot0 = \boxed{1}$$.
Suppose that the number of ounces of pure water necessary is equal to $w$
Then, the total amount of liquid in the mixture is $30 + w$
The acid content of the mixture will always be $30\% \times 30 = 9$ ounces of acid
Thus, the amount of acid in the mixture is equal to $\frac{9}{30 + w}$
Setting this equal to $20\% = \frac 15$, it follows that $$\frac{9}{30+w} = \frac 15 \Longrightarrow 30+w = 45.$$ Thus, $w = \boxed{15}$ ounces of pure water.
Subtract the first equation from the second: \begin{align*}
(x+y)-(x-y) &= 12-6\\
2y &= 6\\
y &= \boxed{3}.
\end{align*}
The graph of $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ is a circle centered at $(0,0)$ of radius $\sqrt{25}=5$
Beginning at $(-5, 0)$ and working our way around the circle, we have the following 12 points on the circle:
$(-5, 0)$, $(-4, 3)$, $(-3, 4)$, $(0, 5)$, $(3, 4)$, $(4, 3)$, $(5, 0)$, $(4, -3)$, $(3, -4)$, $(0, -5)$, $(-3, -4)$, $(-4, -3)$.
The greatest possible sum for any of these pairs is $3+4=\boxed{7}$.
(Of course, you could probably have guess-checked this answer relatively easily, but recognizing the equation as the graph of a circle is helpful in convincing yourself that there is no greater value of $x+y$ ..
or, for example, if you wanted to find the greatest possible value of $x+y$, which is $5\sqrt2$).
Since we defined $g(x) = h\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$, a real number $x$ is in the domain of $g$ if and only if $\frac{x}{2}$ is in the domain of $h$
Therefore, the domain of $g$ consists of all $x$ such that $$-8\le \frac x2\le 8.$$The solutions to this inequality are given by $-16\le x\le 16$, so the domain of $g$ is an interval of width $16 - (-16) = \boxed{32}$.
Converting the given information to equational form, we find $M(M-6) = -5$
Rearranging, $M^2 - 6M + 5 = 0$
Using Vieta's equations for sum and product of roots, we find that the sum of the solutions to this equations is $-(-6) = \boxed{6}$.
Say she bought $h$ hardcovers and $p$ paperbacks
She bought ten volumes total, so $h+p=10$
Her total cost, $25h+15p$, was $220$, or dividing by 5 $5h+3p=44$
Multiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting it from the second, we get $5h-3h+3p-3p=2h=44-30=14$, or $h=\boxed{7}$.
The square of the binomial $rx+s$ is  \[(rx+s)^2=r^2x^2+2rsx+s^2.\]If this is equal to $ax^2+12x+9$, then $s$ must be either 3 or $-3$
Since $(rx+s)^2=(-rx-s)^2$, we may choose either $s=3$ or $s=-3$, and the solution will be the same
We choose $s=3$.
The square of $rx+3$ is  \[(rx+3)^2=r^2x^2+6rx+9.\]If this is equal to $ax^2+12x+9$ then we must have $12=6r$ or $r=2$
This gives our square: \[\left(2x+3\right)^2=4x^2+12x+9.\]Therefore $a=\boxed{4}$.
We know that when $x+y=42$, $x=2y$
Substituting $2y$ in for $x$ in the first equation gives $3y=42$, or $y=14$
The value of $x$ is then $2(14)=28$
Since $x$ and $y$ are inversely proportional, the product $xy$ is constant
Let $xy=k$
When $x=28$ and $y=14$, $k=(28)(14)=392$
Therefore, when $x=-8$, $(-8)y=392$, giving $y=\boxed{-49}$.
$60\%$ of $100$ men is $60$ people.
$80\%$ of $900$ women is $720$ people.
So out of $1000$ total people surveyed, $780$ are supportive
This is $\boxed{78\%}$.
The left-hand side factors into $x(x+a)=-14$, so $x$ and $x+a$ both divide $-14$
One of the two factors is negative and the other positive, since their product is negative
$x+a>x$, so $x+a>0$ and $x<0$
This leaves 4 possibilities for $x$, since it is negative and divides $-14$ evenly: $-1$, $-2$, $-7$, and $-14$
$x=-1$ gives $x+a=14$ and therefore $a=15$
Similarly, $x=-2$, $x=-7$, and $x=-14$ give $a=9$, $a=9$, and $a=15$, respectively
The largest value for $a$ is thus $\boxed{15}$.
The horizontal separation between $(1,1)$ and $(4,7)$ is $4-1=3$ units
The vertical separation between the points is $7-1=6$ units
Therefore, the segment whose endpoints are (1,1) and (4,7) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs measure 3 units and 6 units
By the Pythagorean, the length of this segment is $\sqrt{3^2+6^2}=3\sqrt{1^2+2^2}=\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}$.
We use the distance formula: $$\sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (x - 3)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (x - 3)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 6x + 18} = 5.$$ Squaring both sides and rearranging terms, we find that \begin{align*}
x^2 - 6x + 18 &= 25 \\
x^2 - 6x - 7 &= 0\\
(x - 7)(x + 1) &= 0
\end{align*} Thus, $x = 7$ or $x = -1$
We are given that $x > 0$, so $x = \boxed{7}$.
- OR -
Note that the points $(1, 3)$, $(4, 3)$, and $(4, x)$ form a right triangle
We are given that one of the legs has length 3 and the hypotenuse has length 5
This is a Pythagorean triple, so the last leg must have length 4
Therefore, $x = 3 - 4 = -1$ or $x = 3 + 4 = 7$
Since $x > 0$, we find that $x = \boxed{7}$.
The vertical asymptotes will occur when the denominator of a simplified rational expression is equal to zero
We factor the denominator $3x^2+5x+2$ to obtain $(3x+2)(x+1)$
Hence, there are vertical asymptotes when $x=-1,-\frac{2}{3}$, and the sum of these values of $x$ is $-1-\frac{2}{3}=\boxed{-\frac{5}{3}.}$
(We can also use Vieta's formulas, which states that the sum of the roots of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$.)
We complete the square on the quadratic in $x$ by adding $(10/2)^2=25$ to both sides, and complete the square on the quadratic in $y$ by adding $(24/2)^2=144$ to both sides
We have the equation  \[(x^2+10x+25)+(y^2+24y+144)=169 \Rightarrow (x+5)^2+(y+12)^2=169\]We see that this is the equation of a circle with center $(-5,-12)$ and radius 13
Thus, the area of the region enclosed by this circle is $\pi \cdot 13^2=\boxed{169\pi}$.
Consider the quadratic formula $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
In order for the quadratic to have real roots, the expression underneath the square root (the discriminant) must be either positive or equal to zero
Thus, this gives us the inequality \begin{align*} b^2-4ac&\ge0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad b^2-4(1)(16)&\ge0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad b^2-64&\ge0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (b+8)(b-8)&\ge0
\end{align*} Thus, we find that $ b\in\boxed{(-\infty,-8]\cup [8,\infty)} $.
Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we have \begin{align*}
\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i} \cdot \frac{1-2i}{1-2i} &= \frac{3(1) + 3(-2i) + 4i(1) + 4i(-2i)}{1(1) + 1(-2i) + 2i(1) -2i(2i)} \\
&= \dfrac{11-2i}{5} = \boxed{\dfrac{11}{5} - \dfrac{2}{5}i}.
\end{align*}
Let Hardy's number be $h$ and Ramanujan's be $r$
We have the equations: \begin{align*}
rh&=32-8i,\\
h&=5+3i.
\end{align*} Thus, \[r=\frac{32-8i}{5+3i}.\] Multiplying top and bottom by the conjugate of $5+3i$, we have \[r=\frac{(32-8i)(5-3i)}{34}\] or  \[r=\frac{136-136i}{34}=\boxed{4-4i}\]
The question implies that we can factor the given quadratic as \begin{align*}
x^2+bx+2008 &= (x+r)(x+s)\\
& = x^2+(r+s)x+rs, \end{align*} where $r$ and $s$ are integers
Since both $b$ and 2008 are positive, it is clear that $r$ and $s$ must also be positive
By multiplying out the right-hand side as shown, we see that we must have $rs=2008$, which has prime factorization $2008=2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 251$
Recall that we are trying to minimize $b=r+s$
The best we can do is to let $r=251$ and $s=8$, leading to $b=251+8=\boxed{259}$.
The cost to fly is $\$0.10$ per kilometer plus a $\$100$ booking fee
To fly $3250\text{ km}$ from $A$ to $B,$ the cost is $$3250\times 0.10 + 100=325+100=\boxed{\$425}.$$
We substitute $f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2$ into $f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x$ to find that $(x^3 - 2x - 2) + g(x) = -2 + x.$ Then, $g(x) = -2 + x - (x^3 - 2x - 2).$ Distributing, we find $g(x) = -2 + x - x^3 + 2x + 2 = \boxed{-x^3 + 3x}.$
The two lines have equations \[
y -15=3(x-10)\quad\text{and}\quad y -15=5(x-10).
\]The $x$-intercepts, obtained by setting $y=0$ in the respective equations, are 5 and 7
The distance between the  points $(5,0)$ and $(7,0)$ is $\boxed{2}$.
We see that $3y^2-y-24 = (3y + 8)(y - 3)$, thus $a = 8$ and $b = -3$
Hence, $a - b = \boxed{11}.$
We substitute these two points into the given equation to solve for $c$
Plugging in $(-1,-11)$, we get $-11=(-1)^2-1b+c\Rightarrow -b+c=-12$
Plugging in $(3,17)$, we get $17=3^2+3b+c \Rightarrow 3b+c=8$
In summary, we have the two equations \begin{align*}
-b+c&=-12\\
3b+c&=8
\end{align*} Multiplying the first equation by 3, we have $-3b+3c=-36$
Adding the second equation to this last one, we have $(-3b+3c)+(3b+c)=-36+8 \Rightarrow c=\boxed{-7}$.

Consider the numbers $1, 2, 3,..., 10$
Jo would add these integers up as is, while Kate would round the first four down to 0, decreasing her sum by $1+2+3+4=10$, and would round the last six up to 10, increasing her sum by $5+4+3+2+1+0=15$
Thus, her sum is $-10+15=5$ more than Jo's sum for the numbers $1, 2, 3,..., 10$
This same logic applies to the numbers $11, 12, 13,..., 20$ also, and in general it applies to every ten numbers greater than 20
Since there are ten sets of ten numbers from 1 to 100, Kate's sum is $10 \cdot 5 = \boxed{50}$ more than Jo's sum.
Because the point for which we are looking is on the $x$-axis, we know that it is of the form $(x, 0)$
We apply the distance formula
The distance from A is  \begin{align*}
\sqrt{(-2-x)^2+(0-0)^2} &= \sqrt{x^2+4x+4}
\end{align*} The distance from B is  \begin{align*}
\sqrt{(0-x)^2 + (4-0)^2} &= \sqrt{x^2+16}
\end{align*} Because the point is equidistant from A and B, we set the two distances equal: $x^2+4x+4 = x^2 + 16$
Simplifying gives us $4x = 12$, or $x = \boxed{3}$.
Distributing the exponent and using the power of a power law, we have $(2x^3)^3=(2^3)((x^{3})^3)=8(x^{3\ast3})=\boxed{8x^9}$.
Let's denote the first term as $a$ and the common ratio as $r.$ Additionally, call the original sum of the series $S.$ It follows that \[\frac{a}{1-r}=S.\] After the first three terms of the sequence are removed, the new leading term is $ar^3.$ Then one $27^{\text{th}}$ of the original series is equivalent to \[\frac{ar^3}{1-r}=r^3\left( \frac{a}{1-r}\right)=\frac{S}{27}.\]
Dividing the second equation by the first, $r^3= \frac{1}{27}$ and $r=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}.$
Note that if the the two series have constant ratios of $a$ and $b,$ respectively, then $4\left( \frac{12}{1-a} \right) = \frac{12}{1-b}.$ Simplifying, $4(1-b)=1-a.$ Substituting in $a= \frac{4}{12}=\frac{1}{3}$ and $b= \frac{4+n}{12}=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{n}{12},$ we quickly find that $n=\boxed{6}.$
Plugging in, $f(11) = 11^2 + 11 + 17 = 121 + 28 = \boxed{149}$.
First, we use the distributive property to expand the first two factors:
\begin{align*}
3(x+4)(x+5) &= (3\cdot x + 3 \cdot 4) (x+5)\\
&=(3x+12)(x+5)
\end{align*}We use the distributive property again by adding the product of $3x+12$ and $x$ to the product of $3x+12$ and 5:
\begin{align*}
(3x+12)(x+5) &= (3x+12) \cdot x +(3x+12) \cdot 5\\
&= x(3x+12) + 5(3x+12)
\end{align*}We use the distributive property again and combine like terms:
\begin{align*}
x(3x+12) + 5(3x+12) &= 3x^2 + 12x + 15x+ 60\\
&= \boxed{3x^2 + 27x + 60}
\end{align*}
While we can solve for $a$ and $b$ individually, it is simpler to note that $f(1) = a + b$
Thus, substituting $1$ into the given equation, we obtain $$g(f(1)) = 3 \cdot 1 + 4 = 7.$$ Thus, $$g(f(1)) = 2 \cdot f(1) - 5 = 7 \Longrightarrow f(1) = \boxed{6}.$$
We will complete the square to determine the standard form equation of the circle
Shifting all but the constant term from the RHS to the LHS, we have $x^2-4x+y^2-12y=-39$
Completing the square in $x$, we add $(-4/2)^2=4$ to both sides
Completing the square in $y$, we add $(-12/2)^2=36$ to both sides
The equation becomes \begin{align*}
x^2-4x+y^2-12y&=-39\\
\Rightarrow x^2-4x+4+y^2-12y+36&=1\\
\Rightarrow (x-2)^2+(y-6)^2&=1
\end{align*} Thus, the center of the circle is at point $(2,6)$ so $h+k=2+6=\boxed{8}$.
We proceed as follows: \begin{align*}
(x - 2)(2x + 5) &= 8x - 6\\
2x^2 + x - 10 &= 8x - 6\\
2x^2 - 7x - 4 &= 0\\
(x - 4)(2x + 1) &= 0.
\end{align*}This gives us $x = 4$ or $x = -\frac{1}{2}.$ However, since the latter would make $x - 2$ negative, we see that $x = \boxed{4}.$
We have $f(z)=a_2 \cdot z^2+a_1 \cdot z+a_0$, and $g(z)=b_1 \cdot z+b_0$, where $a_2$ is nonzero
Then $f(z)+g(z)=a_2 \cdot z^2+(a_1+b_1) \cdot z+(a_0+b_0)$
The degree of this polynomial is $\boxed{2}$.
The graph of a quadratic function has an axis of symmetry
Observing that $q(7)=q(8),$ $q(6)=q(9),$ and so on, we see that this graph's axis of symmetry is $x=7.5$, and so $q(15)=q(0)$.
The graph passes through the point $(0,-3)$, so $q(0)=-3$, which tells us that $q(15)=\boxed{-3}$ as well.
The denominator, $2+4x^2$, takes all values greater than or equal to $2$
Therefore, $\frac{2}{2+4x^2}$ is at most $\frac 22=1$, and can take any positive value smaller than this
So, the range of $g(x)$ is $(0,1]$, which gives $a+b=\boxed{1}$.
We see that $-2$ is not in the range of $f(x) = x^2 + bx + 2$ if and only if the equation $x^2 + bx + 2 = -2$ has no real roots
We can re-write this equation as $x^2 + bx + 4 = 0$
The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \cdot 4 = b^2 - 16$
The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 16 < 0$, or $b^2 < 16$
The set of values of $b$ that satisfy this inequality is $b \in \boxed{(-4,4)}$.
The coordinate at which the two will meet is the midpoint of the two given coordinates
We apply the midpoint formula to find $$\left(\frac{-4+0}{2},\frac{-1+7}{2}\right)=\boxed{(-2,3)}.$$
Notice that the quantity $4a^2+1$ appears in various forms throughout the expression on the left-hand side
So let $4a^2+1=x$ to simplify the expression to $\frac{7\sqrt{x}-x}{\sqrt{x}+3}$
This still looks messy, so let $\sqrt{x}=y$
Our equation becomes \begin{align*}
\frac{7y-y^2}{y+3}&=2.
\end{align*} Clearing denominators, rearranging, and factoring, we find \begin{align*}
7y-y^2&=2(y+3)\quad \Rightarrow\\
7y-y^2&=2y+6\quad \Rightarrow\\
0&=y^2-5y+6\quad \Rightarrow\\
0&=(y-2)(y-3).
\end{align*} Thus $y=2$ or $y=3$, so $\sqrt{x}=2,3$ and $x=4$ or $x=9$
Re-substituting, we have $4a^2+1=4$, meaning $4a^2=3$, $a^2=\frac{3}{4}$, and $a=\pm\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
On the other hand we could have $4a^2+1=9$, giving $4a^2=8$, $a^2=2$, and $a=\pm\sqrt{2}$
The greatest possible value of $a$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{2}}$.
If the two solutions are $r$ and $s$, then the left-hand side of the equation may be factored as $-(x-r)(x-s)$
When multiplied out, this expression takes the form $-x^2+(r+s)x-rs$
Therefore, $r+s$ is the coefficient of $x$ in the equation, namely $\boxed{-15}$.
$(-2)\ \$\ 3=-2(3+1)-6=-8-6=\boxed{-14}$.
Replace a triangle with the letter $a$ and a circle with the letter $b.$ The two given equations become \begin{align*}
3a+2b&=21\\
2a+3b&=19.
\end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by $2,$ we get $6a+4b=42.$ Multiplying the second equation by $3,$ we get $6a+9b=57.$ Subtracting these two equations to eliminate $a,$ we have $5b=15.$ Multiplying both sides by $\frac{3}{5},$ we get $$\frac{3}{5}\cdot 5b = \frac{3}{5} \cdot 15 \Rightarrow 3b=9.$$Thus, three circles equals $\boxed{9}.$
If increasing the $x$ value by 3 units increases the $y$ value by 7, then increasing the $x$ value by $3\cdot3=9$ units will increase the $y$ value by $7\cdot3=\boxed{21}$ units.
When $x<1$ or $x>5$, $-x^2+bx-5<0$
That means that $-x^2+bx-5=0$ at $x=1$ and $x=5$
So, the parabola has roots at 1 and 5, giving us $(x-1)(x-5)=0$
However, we also know the parabola opens downwards since the coefficient of $x^2$ is negative, so we have to negate one of the factors
We can now write $-x^2+bx-5=(1-x)(x-5)=-x^2+6x-5$
Thus, $b=\boxed{6}$.
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is
\[\frac{2a}{a} = 2,\]so their average is $\boxed{1}.$
Call the first number $x$ and the second number $y$
Without loss of generality, assume $x > y$
We can represent the information given in the problem with the following system of linear equations:
\begin{align*}
x - y &= 9\\
x^2 + y^2 &= 153
\end{align*} Solving for $x$ in the first equation and substituting into the second yields $(9+y)^2 + y^2 = 153$, or $2y^2 + 18y - 72 = 0$
Canceling a $2$ gives $y^2 + 9y - 36 = 0$, which factors into $(y+12)(y-3)$
Thus, $y = 3$ and $x = 12$
So, $x \cdot y = \boxed{36}$.
We are given $x+y+z=165$, $n=7x = y-9 = z+9$
Solving the last three equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$, respectively, and substituting into the first equation, we have $n/7+(n+9)+(n-9)=165$, which implies $n=77$
Therefore, the three numbers are 11, 68, and 86
The product of 11, 68, and 86 is $\boxed{64,\!328}$.
This is a geometric sequence with first term $1$ and common ratio $\frac{1}{3}$
Thus the sum of the first $n$ terms is: $$\frac{121}{81}=\frac{1\left[1-\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n\right]}{1-\frac{1}{3}}=\frac{3^n-1}{2\cdot 3^{n-1}}.$$Solving we have: \begin{align*}
\frac{3^n-1}{2\cdot 3^{n-1}} &= \frac{121}{81}\\
\frac{3^n-1}{2\cdot 3^n} &= \frac{121}{243}\\
243(3^n - 1) &= 121\cdot2\cdot 3^n\\
243\cdot 3^n - 243 &= 242\cdot 3^n\\
3^n&= 243\\
n&= \boxed{5}.
\end{align*}
Before moving, the midpoint (in terms of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$) is $M(m,n)=\left(\frac{a+c}{2},\frac{b+d}{2}\right)$
$A$ is moved to a point $(a+2,b+8)$
$B$ is moved to a point $(c-10,d-2)$
We find that the new midpoint $M'$ is \begin{align*}
\left(\frac{a+2+c-10}{2},\frac{b+8+d-2}{2}\right)&=\left(\frac{a+c}{2}-4,\frac{b+d}{2}+3\right)\\
&=(m-4,n+3).
\end{align*}Thus, the distance between $M$ and $M'$ is equivalent to the distance between $(m,n)$ and $(m-4,n+3)$, or $$\sqrt{(m-4-m)^2+(n+3-n)^2}=\boxed{5}.$$
We have $7^\frac12=\sqrt7$, so $\log_7 \sqrt7 = \boxed{\frac12}$.
Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=95$
With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 96$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=96$
We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $96$: $(96,1), (48,2), (32,3), (24,4), (16,6), \text{and} (12,8)$
Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 4 pairs
The pair $(16,6)$ gives us $a=15, b=5$ which doesn't work because $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, so we are left with the last pair, which gives $a=11$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\boxed{18}$.
The $y$-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the $y$-axis
The $x$-coordinate of such a point is 0
Setting $x=0$ in the equation gives $-2y = 5$, so $y = \boxed{-\frac{5}{2}}$.
First, we divide both sides of the equation by $2$ to find that $x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 2y = 10$
Completing the square, we arrive at $(x -3)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 20$
Thus, the circle has radius $\sqrt{20}$.

It follows that a side length of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, or $2\sqrt{20}$
The area of the square is thus $\left(2\sqrt{20}\right)^2 = \boxed{80}$ square units.
Notice that the information that the sides were parallel to the x-axis is irrelevant.
$2 - iz = -1 + 3iz \Rightarrow 3 = 4iz \Rightarrow z = \frac{3}{4i}$
Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $-i$, we get $z = \frac{3}{4i} \cdot \frac{-i}{-i} = \frac{-3i}{4} = \boxed{-\frac34i}$.
We complete the square on the quadratic in $x$ by adding $(12/2)^2=36$ to both sides, and complete the square on the quadratic in $y$ by adding $(16/2)^2=64$ to both sides
We have the equation  \[(x^2+12x+36)+(y^2+16y+64)=100 \Rightarrow (x+6)^2+(y+8)^2=100\]We see that this is the equation of a circle with center $(-6,-8)$ and radius 10
Thus, the area of the region enclosed by this circle is $\pi \cdot 10^2=\boxed{100\pi}$.
When we expand we get  \begin{align*}
&3(x^2 - x^3) +2(x - 2x^2 + 3x^5) -(4x^3 - x^2) \\
&\qquad =3x^2 - 3x^3 +2x - 4x^2 + 6x^5 -4x^3 + x^2\\
&\qquad =6x^5-7x^3+2x.
\end{align*}The coefficient of $x^2$ is $3-4+1=\boxed{0}$.
The numerator is equal to $x^{1+2+3+\cdots + 15}$
The exponent is the sum of the first 15 consecutive positive integers, so its sum is $\frac{15\cdot16}{2}=120$
So the numerator is $x^{120}$.
The denominator is equal to $x^{2+4+6+\cdots + 20}=x^{2(1+2+3+\cdots + 10)}$
The exponent is twice the sum of the first 10 consecutive positive integers, so its sum is $2\cdot \frac{10\cdot11}{2}=110$
So the denominator is $x^{110}$.
The entire fraction becomes $\frac{x^{120}}{x^{110}}=x^{120-110}=x^{10}$
Plugging in $x=2$ yields $2^{10}=\boxed{1024}$.
First we get all the terms with $y$ on one side by subtracting $1.7y$ from both sides
This gives us $4+0.6y = -20$
Subtracting 4 from both sides gives $0.6y = -24$
Dividing both sides by 0.6 isolates $y$ and gives us $y = -24/(0.6) = -240/6 = \boxed{-40}$.
The sum of the integers from $-30$ to 30 is zero, so we need to find only the sum of the integers from 31 to 50.
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms
The number of integers from 31 to 50 is $50 - 31 + 1 = 20$, so the sum is $(31 + 50)/2 \cdot 20 = \boxed{810}$.
We can simplify the inequality to $5x^{2}+19x-4 > 0$, which can then be factored into $(5x-1)(x+4)>0$
We see that this inequality is satisfied when $x<-4$ and $\frac{1}{5}<x$, because in former case $5x-1$ and $x+4$ are both negative, and in the latter case they are both positive
This means that the inequality is not satisfied for $x$ between $-4$ and $\frac{1}{5}$
The integer values of $x$ in this range are $-4, -3, -2, -1, \text{ and }0$, and there are $\boxed{5}$ of them.
First we bring $3x$ to the left side to get  \[x^2-7x-14=16.\]Moving the 14 to the right side gives \[x^2-7x=30.\]We notice that the left side is almost the square $\left(x-\frac72\right)^2=x^2-7x+\frac{49}4$
Adding $\frac{49}4$ to both sides lets us complete the square on the left-hand side, \[x^2-7x+\frac{49}4=30+\frac{49}4=\frac{169}4,\]so  \[\left(x-\frac72\right)^2=\left(\frac{13}2\right)^2.\]Therefore $x=\frac72\pm\frac{13}2$
The sum of these solutions is  \[\frac{7+13}2+\frac{7-13}2=\frac{14}2=\boxed{7}.\]
Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$
The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$
Hence, $a = -75/25 = \boxed{-3}$.
First, we combine like terms in the expression: \begin{align*}
&(6a^3+92a^2-7)-(-7a^3+a^2-7)\\
& \qquad=6a^3+92a^2-7+7a^3-a^2+7\\
&\qquad=13a^3+91a^2.
\end{align*}We can factor out a $13a^2$ from the expression, to get \[13a^3+91a^2=\boxed{13a^2(a+7)}.\]
The vertex of the parabola appears to be at the value $x=1$, where $y=3$
Therefore we should have \[y=a(x-1)^2+3\] for some integer $a$
We also know that $(0,1)$ is on the graph of the equation, so \[1=a(0-1)^2+3=a+3.\] Therefore  \[a=1-3=\boxed{-2}.\]
Consider the quadratic formula $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
Since the quadratic has exactly one real root, then its discriminant must be 0
Thus, this gives us  \begin{align*} 0&=b^2-4ac
\\\Rightarrow\qquad0&=(4m)^2-4m
\\\Rightarrow\qquad0&=16m^2-4m
\\\Rightarrow\qquad0&=4m(4m-1).
\end{align*}This gives us the two possible values of $m$: $0$ and $\frac{1}{4}$
Since the question only asks for the positive value, our final answer is $\boxed{\frac14}$.
This question is equivalent to asking, "What is the present value of $\$500,\!000$ paid 10 years from now if the annually compounded interest rate is $5\%$?"  This present value is \[\frac{\$500,\!000}{(1+0.05)^{10}} \approx \boxed{\$306,\!956.63}.\]
The slope of a line through points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$  is: $$\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\text{slope}$$ In this case, we have: $$\frac{y-7}{4-(-2)}=\frac{-3}{2}$$ $$2y-14=-18$$ $$2y=-4$$ $$y=\boxed{-2}$$
This 6-term geometric series has first term $a_0 = \frac12$ and ratio $\frac12$, so it has value  \begin{align*}
\frac{\frac12(1-\left(\frac12\right)^{6})}{1-\frac12} &= 1-\left(\frac12\right)^{6}\\
&= 1-\frac1{64}\\
&= \boxed{\frac{63}{64}}.
\end{align*}
The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative
Therefore, $x-2 \ge 0$, so $x\ge2$, and $5 - x \ge 0$, so $x \le 5$
Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$
Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\boxed{[2,5)}$.
Since the interest rate is simple, he has to pay an interest of $10 \cdot 0.15 =1.5$ dollars every day.
Let $x$ be the number of days needed to repay at least double the amount borrowed
Since he has to repay $10 as well as $\$1.5x$ in interest, we have the inequality $10+1.5x \ge 10 \cdot 2$
Solving for $x$, we get $x \ge 6.\overline{6}$
The smallest integer greater than $6.\overline{6}$ is $7$
Therefore, it would take at least $\boxed{7 \text{ days}}$.
$f(g(x))$ must have a degree of 6, because it will produce the term with the greatest exponent of the polynomial
Because $f(x)$ is a degree 2 polynomial, we can write that $f(x)=bx^2+cx+d$
The term with the greatest exponent in $f(g(x))$ comes from taking $bx^2$ or $b(g(x))^2$
Let $g(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x^{1}+a_0$
Then, the highest degree term of $f(g(x))$ is $b(a_nx^n)^2$, which equals $ba_{n}^2x^{2n}$
Since the degree of $h$ is 6, we have $2n=6$, so $n=3$
Therefore, the degree of $g$ is $\boxed{3}$.
Since $g(5) = 5+3=8$ and $f(5) = 5^2 - 2(5) + 5 = 25-10+5 = 20$, we have $f(g(5)) -g(f(5)) = f(8) - g(20) = 8^2 - 2(8) + 5 - (20+3) = 64 - 16 + 5 - 23 = \boxed{30}$.
Let $a$ be Andrew's age now and $g$ be his grandfather's age now
We are looking for the value of $a$
We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information, as follows:
\begin{align*}
g &= 12a \\
g-a &= 55 \\
\end{align*}
In particular, the second equation represents the grandfather's age $a$ years ago, when Andrew was born
To solve for $a$, we need to eliminate $g$ from the equations above
Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $g$, we get that $12a-a=55$ or $a=5$
Thus, Andrew is $\boxed{5}$ years old now.
We cube both sides to eliminate the cube root: $3-\frac{1}{x}=-64$
Simplifying gives $\frac{1}{x}=67$ and taking the reciprocal of both sides gives $\boxed{x=\frac{1}{67}}$.
The given parabola has vertex at $(0,a^2)$
The line $y=x+a$ passes through this point if and only if $a^2=0+a$
Rearranging the equation gives $a^2-a=0$
Factoring an $a$ out of the left hand side yields $a(a-1)=0$, so $a=0$ or $a=1$
Thus, there are $\boxed{2}$ possible values of $a$.
The powers of $i$ repeat every four powers: $i^1=i$, $i^2=-1$, $i^3=-i$, $i^4=1$, $i^5=i$, $i^6=-1$ and so on
So to determine $i^n$, where $n$ is an integer, we only need to find the remainder of $n$ when it is divided by 4
The remainder of both 22 and 222 when divided by 4 is 2, so $i^{22} + i^{222} = i^2 + i^2 = -1 + (-1) = \boxed{-2}$.
We approach this problem by working from the inside out, so we first find $f(17)$
Since $17 \geq 7$, $f(17) = 17 - 13 = 4$
Next, $4<7$, so $f(f(17))=f(4)=(4)^2-4=12$
Finally we have that since $12 \geq 7$, $f(f(f(17)))=f(12)=12-13=\boxed{-1}$.
Let the two integers be $n$ and $n + 1,$ so $n(n + 1) < 400.$  Then the largest possible value of $n$ will be close to the square root of 400, which is $\sqrt{400} = 20.$  For $n = 19,$ $n(n + 1) = 19 \cdot 20 = 380,$ and for $n = 20,$ $n(n + 1) = 20 \cdot 21 = 420,$ so the largest possible sum of two consecutive integers whose product is less than 400 is $19 + 20 = \boxed{39}.$
At an annual interest rate of one percent, after five years, Lisa's investment will grow to $1000 \cdot 1.01^5 = 1051$ dollars, to the nearest dollar
Therefore, she earns $1051 - 1000 = \boxed{51}$ dollars in interest.
$2x + 3 = 2(3) + 3 = 6 + 3 = \boxed{9}$.
We complete the square.
Factoring $-6$ out of the quadratic and linear terms gives $-6x^2 + 36x = -6(x^2-6x)$.
Since $(x-3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9$, we can write $$-6(x-3)^2 = -6x^2 + 36x - 54.$$This quadratic agrees with the given $-6x^2 + 36x + 216$ in all but the constant term
We can write
\begin{align*}
-6x^2 + 36x + 216 &= (-6x^2 + 36x - 54) + 270 \\
&= -6(x-3)^2 + 270.
\end{align*}Therefore, $a=-6$, $b=-3$, $c=270$, and $a+b+c = -6-3+270 = \boxed{261}$.
Since $4=2^2$, we have that $4^2={2^2}^2=2^4$
We know that $2^{x-3}=4^2=2^4$, so $x-3=4$
Solving for $x$, we find that $x=4+3=\boxed{7}$.
The equation, $9^n\cdot9^n\cdot9^n\cdot9^n=81^4$, can be written as $9^{4n}=81^4$
We also know that $81=9^2$, so we can rewrite the equation as $9^{4n}=9^{2(4)}$
Solving for $n$, gives $n=\boxed{2}$.
This problem is immediate once you know the following fact:
For the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the solutions of the equation is $-b/a$ and the product of the solutions is $c/a$.
In this case, $b = 1992$ and $a = 1$, so the sum of the solutions is $-b/a = \boxed{-1992}$.
We have that $c=4d$, $b=2c$, and $a=3b$ and thus we can use the equations $c=4d$, $b=8d$, and $a=24d$ to find the value of the expression
Plugging in these values we get $\frac{24d \cdot 4d}{8d \cdot d}=\boxed{12}$.
From the problem, we can see that $XZ = ZY$ and $XZ + ZY = XY$, which means that $X,$ $Y,$ and $Z$ form a degenerate triangle
In other words, $Z$ is the midpoint of $XY$
Since from Y to Z, we go 2 steps left and 14 steps down, we do the same to arrive at $X = (-1 - 2, -7 -14) = (-3, -21).$ Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of $X$ is $\boxed{-24}.$
Call Jim's weight $j$ and Bob's weight $b$
We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given: \begin{align*}
j + b &= 180 \\
b - j &= \frac{b}{2} \\
\end{align*} Adding the two equations together gives $2b = 180 + \frac{b}{2}$
Solving for $b$ gives $3b = 360$, or $b = 120$
Thus, Bob weighs $\boxed{120}$ pounds.
Let $C$, $D$, $E$, and $F$ denote the ages of Chad, Diana, Eduardo, and Faye
We are given three equations
\begin{align*}
D&=E-3 \\
E&=C+4 \\
C+3&=F
\end{align*} Summing these three equations, we find that $E$ and $C$ cancel to leave $D+3=F+1$, which implies $F=D+2$
Since $D=14$, we have $F=\boxed{16}$.
Instead of expanding the entire product, we can look only at terms that will multiply to give $x^2$
We know that: $$x^2=x^2\cdot 1=x\cdot x=1\cdot x^2$$Knowing this, the $x^2$ term in the expansion will be the sum of these three terms: $$(-5x^2)(1)+(-7x)(-6x)+(1)(-x^2)$$Simplifying gives: \begin{align*}
(-5x^2)(1)+(-7x)(-6x)+(1)(-x^2)&=-5x^2+42x^2-x^2\\
&=\boxed{36}x^2
\end{align*}Consequently, the desired coefficient is $\boxed{36}$.
Combining the expressions on the left-hand side, we obtain \[\begin{aligned} \sqrt{8x}\cdot\sqrt{10x}\cdot\sqrt{3x}\cdot\sqrt{15x}&=15 \\
\sqrt{3600x^4} &= 15 \\
60x^2 &= 15 \\
x^2 &= \frac{15}{60} = \frac{1}{4}.\end{aligned} \]Since $x$ must be positive, the only solution is $x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
The equation $x^2+y^2+21=4x+18y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-4x+y^2-18y=-21$
Completing the square, this can further be rewritten as $(x-2)^2-4+(y-9)^2-81=-21$
Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $(x-2)^2+(y-9)^2=64$, which is the equation of a circle with center $(2,9)$ and radius $\boxed{8}$.
We know that $x^2-6x+c$ must be negative somewhere, but since it opens upward (the leading coefficient is $1$) it must also be positive somewhere
This means it must cross the $x$-axis, so it must have real roots
If it has only $1$ real root, the quadratic will be tangent to the $x$-axis and will never be negative, so it must have $2$ real roots
Thus the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ must be positive
So we have $(-6)^2-4(1)(c)>0$, giving $36-4c>0\Rightarrow 36>4c\Rightarrow 9>c$
Since $c$ must be positive, we have $0<c<9$, or $\boxed{(0,9)}$.
The expression is undefined when the denominator of the fraction is equal to zero, so we are looking for values of $x$ that satisfy $(x^2+2x-3)(x-3)=0$
This polynomial factors further as $(x-1)(x+3)(x-3)=0$, giving us the solutions $x=1$, $x=-3$ and $x=3$
Therefore, there are $\boxed{3}$ values of $x$ for which the expression is undefined.
Since $-7<-5$, $f(-7)=3$
Since $-5 \le 0 \le 5$, $f(0)=2(0)-3=-3$
Since $7>5$, $f(7)=7^2+1=50$
Therefore, $f(-7)+f(0)+f(-7)=3-3+50=\boxed{50}$.
We see that $x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2$
If $x$ must be positive, we can see that this expression can take on the value of any perfect square that is greater than or equal to 16
Thus, the problem is asking for how many perfect squares there are between 20 and 40
There are only $\boxed{2}$, namely 25 and 36.
Since the two lines intersect at $(6,10)$, each must pass through that point
So, we can substitute this point for $x$ and $y$ in the two given equations, then solve for $m$ and $b$
In the first equation we find: \begin{align*}
10&=m(6)+4\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 6&=6m\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 1&=m
\end{align*} Using the same method in the second equation gives: \begin{align*}
10&=3(6)+b\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 10&=18+b\\
\Rightarrow\qquad -8&=b
\end{align*} The value of $b+m$ is equal to $1+(-8)=\boxed{-7}$.
We know that a rational function will have vertical asymptotes at values of $x$ for which $f(x)$ is undefined
Additionally, we know that $f(x)$ is undefined when the denominator of the fraction is equal to zero
Since there are vertical asymptotes at $x=1$ and $x=-2$, the function must be undefined at these two values
Therefore, $(x-1)(x+2)=x^2+ax+b=0 \Rightarrow x^2+x-2=x^2+ax+b$
So $a=1$ and $b=-2$, and $a+b=1+(-2)=\boxed{-1}$.
By the quadratic formula, the roots of the equation are $$x=\frac{-(11)\pm\sqrt{(11)^2-4(\frac32)c}}{2(\frac32)},$$which simplifies to $$x=\frac{-11\pm\sqrt{121-6c}}{3}.$$This looks exactly like our target, except that we have to get the $121-6c$ under the square root to equal $7$
So, we solve the equation $121-6c=7$, which yields $c=\boxed{19}$.
The $y$-axis has equation $x = 0$
Thus we need to find out what $y$ is when $x = 0$
We notice that the slope of the line is $\frac{16 - (-4)}{2 - (-8)} = 2$
So to get to $x = 0$ we can start at $(2, 16)$ and go left two in the $x$ direction
Since the slope of the line is $2$ we know that going left in $x$ by one results in going down in $y$ by two (i.e
$y$ will be 12)
Thus the line intercepts the $y$-axis at $\boxed{(0, 12)}$.
Since 0 times anything is 0, when $y=0$, we have $y(y-3x) = 0(y-3x) = \boxed{0}$.
If we can find such a number whose hundreds digit is 9, then this number will be greater than any with a hundreds digit lower than 9
We want the common ratio to be as small as possible, so that the other digits are as large as possible
If $r$ is the common ratio, then the ones digit is $\frac{9}{r^2}$
One might therefore expect that $r$ has a $3$ in its numerator
We could set $r=3$ for $931$
But $r=\frac{3}{2}$ also works and is actually smaller, giving $\boxed{964}$.
(Note that $r=1$ would not give distinct digits, and $r<1$ would make the ones digit too large.)
The sum of the coefficients in the polynomial $-2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5) + 4(x^3 + 2x) - 3(x^5 - 4)$ is $-2 (1 - 1 + 3 - 5) + 4 (1 + 2) - 3 (1 - 4) = (-2) \cdot (-2) + 4 \cdot 3 - 3 \cdot (-3) = \boxed{25}$
(The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial can be found by setting the variable equal to 1.)
We begin by adding 2 to both sides of the equation, \begin{align*} 23&=x^4+\frac{1}{x^4}
\\\Rightarrow\qquad 25&=x^4+\frac{1}{x^4}+2
\\\Rightarrow\qquad 25&=x^4+2(x^2)\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)+\frac{1}{x^4}
\\\Rightarrow\qquad 25&=\left(x^2+\frac{1}{x^2}\right)^2
\end{align*}  So $x^2+\frac{1}{x^2}$ is equal to either $5$ or $-5$
Since $x^2+\frac{1}{x^2}$ is the sum of two squares, it cannot be negative
So $x^2+\frac{1}{x^2}=\boxed{5}$.
Let $p$ and $q$ be the two integers; then $p,q \in \{2,4,6,8,10,12,14\}$, giving $7 \times 7 = 49$ total possible pairs $(p,q)$
The question asks for the number of different values of $pq + p + q$
Notice that by Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, $$pq + p + q = (p+1)(q+1) - 1,$$so it suffices to find the number of different possible values of $(p+1)(q+1)$
Here, $p+1,q+1 \in \{3,5,7,9,11,13,15\}$.
There are $7$ pairs $(p,q)$ where $p+1$ is equal to $q+1$; by symmetry, half of the $42$ remaining pairs correspond to swapping the values of $p$ and $q$, leaving $42/2 = 21$ pairs $(p,q)$
Since most of the possible values of $p+1$ and $q+1$ are prime factors that do not divide into any of the other numbers, we note that most of the values of $(p+1)(q+1)$ will be distinct
The exception are the numbers divisible by $3$ and $5$: $p+1,q+1 \in \{3,5,9,15\}$; then, if $(p+1,q+1) = (3,15)$ or $(5,9)$, then $(p+1)(q+1) = 45$.
Hence, there are exactly $21-1+7 = \boxed{27}$ distinct possible values of $pq + p + q$.
The given expression is the expansion of $(9+1)^3$
In general, the cube of $(x+y)^3$ is \[(x+y)^3=1x^3+3x^2y+3xy^2+1y^3.\]   The first and last terms in the given expression are cubes and the middle two terms both have coefficient 3, giving us a clue that this is a cube of a binomial and can be written in the form \[(x+y)^3\]In this case, $x=9$ and $y=1$, so our answer is\[(9+1)^3\ = 10^3 = \boxed{1000}\]
There are two cases here: either Tom chooses two yellow marbles (1 result), or he chooses two marbles of different colors ($\binom{4}{2}=6$ results)
The total number of distinct pairs of marbles Tom can choose is $1+6=\boxed{7}$.
Let's first look at the four things the question tells us: First, the number of dogs is $x+y+z+10=\frac{32}{2}$, so $x+y+z=6.$ The number of cats is $w + x+ z +9= 32\times\frac{3}{8}$, so $w + x + z= 3$  Since 6 people have other pets, $w+y+z=4.$ The total number of people with pets is $$w+x+y+z+2+9+10=32-5,$$ so $w+x+y+z=6.$
From here, we can subtract the third equation from the fourth, to find that $x=2$
Plugging that into the first equation, we find $y+z=4$
From the third equation, we can then see, $w=0$
Finally, from the second equation, we find $z=1$
Thus, there is $\boxed{1}$ student with cats, dogs, and other pets.
We can find the probability that no women are selected and subtract it from 1 to find the probability that at least one woman is selected
To find the probability that only men are selected, we consider that the chance that the first person selected is male is $\frac{7}{10}$
Then the probability that the second person selected is male is reduced to $\frac{6}{9}=\frac{2}{3}$
For the third person, the probability is $\frac{5}{8}$
So the probability that only men are selected is $$\frac{7}{10}\cdot\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{5}{8}=\frac{7}{24}.$$ Notice that the 2 and 5 in the numerator cancel with the 10 in the denominator to leave $\frac{7}{24}$
Now we subtract from 1 to find the probability that at least one woman is selected
The probability is $1-\frac{7}{24}=\boxed{\frac{17}{24}}$.
By the binomial theorem, $(m+n)^6$ expands as \begin{align*}
\binom60m^6+\binom61m^5n&+\binom62m^4n^2+\binom63m^3n^3\\
&+\binom64m^2n^4+\binom65mn^5+\binom66n^6.
\end{align*} Since $m$ and $n$ are odd, each of these terms is odd if and only if the binomial coefficient is odd
Since $\binom60=\binom66=1$, $\binom61=\binom65=6$, $\binom62=\binom64=15$, and $\binom63=20$, exactly $\boxed{4}$ of these terms are odd.
Bill cannot purchase 7 jogs, because then he would only have one dollar left over and could not purchase at least one jag and one jig as well
However, Bill can purchase $\boxed{6}$ jogs if, for example, he also purchases 2 jags and 3 jigs.
For the first die to be less than three, it must be a 1 or a 2, which occurs with probability $\frac{1}{3}$
For the second die to be greater than 3, it must be a 4 or a 5 or a 6, which occurs with probability $\frac{1}{2}$
The probability of both of these events occuring, as they are independent, is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$.
If the odds for pulling a prize out of the box are $3:4$, that means that 3 out of 7 times will result in a prize, while 4 out of 7 times will not
So the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $\boxed{\frac{4}{7}}$.
We are interested in how many numbers among $7, 8, 9, \dots, 59$ are relatively prime to 15.
First, we count how many numbers among $1, 2, 3, \dots, 60$ are relatively prime to 15
Note that $15 = 3 \cdot 5$
Among these 60 numbers, $60/3 = 20$ are multiples of 3, $60/5 = 12$ are multiples of 5, and $60/15 = 4$ are multiples of 15
We can take 60, and subtract 20 and 12, but we have subtracted the multiples of 15 twice
Therefore, among the 60 numbers, there are $60 - 20 - 12 + 4 = 32$ numbers that are relatively prime to 15.
Going back to the set $7, 8, 9, \dots, 59$, we must account for the numbers 1, 2, and 4 that are relatively prime to 15
Thus, the answer is $32 - 3 = \boxed{29}$.
We put the time the train arrives on the $y$-axis and the time  John arrives on the $x$-axis, and shade in the region where John arrives while the train is there.
draw((0,0)--(60,0));
draw((0,0)--(0,60)--(60,60)--(60,0));
label("2:00", (0,0), SW);
label("3:00", (60,0), S);
label("3:00", (0,60), W);
label("2:20",(20,0),S);
fill((0,0)--(60,60)--(60,40)--(20,0)--cycle, gray(.7));
[/asy]
The probability that John arrives while the train is at the station is the ratio of the shaded area to the whole square
If we divide the axes into 60 units, the shaded region can be split up into a triangle of area $20\cdot 20/2=200$ square units and a parallelogram of area $20\cdot 40=800$ square units, and the whole square has an area of 3600 square units
The ratio is $1000/3600=\boxed{\frac{5}{18}}$.
In the worst-case scenario, every possible sum is rolled before the same sum is rolled again
The minimum possible sum rolled is $3 \cdot 1 = 3$, and the maximum is $3 \cdot 6 = 18$
Every sum in between those two extremes can be created, since the sums are created through adding three of the digits between one and six
Thus, there are $18 - 2 = 16$ possible sums, so the dice must be rolled $\boxed{17}$ times to ensure that the same sum is rolled twice.
The probability is $\dfrac{4}{52} \times \dfrac{4}{51} \times \dfrac{4}{50} = \boxed{\frac{8}{16575}}$.
There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips
There are $\binom{10}{8}=\binom{10}{2}=45$ ways to get exactly 8 heads, so the probability is $\dfrac{45}{2^{10}}=\boxed{\dfrac{45}{1024}}$.
There are 5 ways in which the first roll is not 1, and 5 ways in which the second roll is not 1, so there are $5 \times 5 = 25$ ways in which neither die shows 1
Therefore there are $36-25=11$ ways in which one or both dice show 1
So the probability of this is $\boxed{\dfrac{11}{36}}$.
To avoid having two yellow pegs in the same row or column, there must be exactly one yellow peg in each row and in each column
Hence, starting at the top of the array, the peg in the first row must be yellow, the second peg of the second row must be yellow, the third peg of the third row must be yellow, etc
To avoid having two red pegs in some row, there must be a red peg in each of rows 2,3,4, and 5
The red pegs must be in the first position of the second row, the second position of the third row, etc
Continuation yields exactly $\boxed{1}$ ordering that meets the requirements, as shown.

First, we choose the suits
There are $\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to do this
Then, we choose one of 13 cards from each of the chosen suits
There are $13^3=2197$ ways to do this
The total number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits is therefore $4\cdot 2197=\boxed{8788}$.
Since 9 out of the 12 possible results are one digit numbers, each die will show a one digit number with probability of $\frac{3}{4}$ and a two digit number with probability of $\frac{1}{4}$
The probability that two particular dice will show 2 two digit numbers and 2 one digit numbers is thus $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2$
There are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to select which two dice will show one digit numbers, so we multiply to get the probability that we want: $6\cdot\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2=\dfrac{54}{256}=\boxed{\dfrac{27}{128}}$.
We will subtract the probability that the product is odd from 1 to get the probability that the product is even
In order for the product to be odd, we must have both numbers be odd
There are $2\cdot2=4$ possibilities for this (a 3 or 5 is spun on the left spinner and a 5 or 7 on the right) out of a total of $3\cdot4=12$ possibilities, so the probability that the product is odd is $4/12=1/3$
The probability that the product is even is $1-1/3=\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
We know that we must take a 7 unit path
If we look at the grid a little more carefully, we can see that our path must consist of 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and we can take those steps in any order
So in order to specify a path, we must choose 3 of our 7 steps to be `up' (and the other 4 steps will thus be `right')
Hence the number of paths is $$ \binom{7}{3} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \boxed{35}
There are six ways to color the equilateral triangle on the left
Without loss of generality, assume it is colored as below.
draw((-75,0)--(-45,0)--(-60,26)--cycle);
draw((0,0)--(30,0)--(15,26)--cycle);
draw((75,0)--(105,0)--(90,26)--cycle);
draw((-60,26)--(90,26));

dot((15,26));
dot((0,0));
dot((30,0));
dot((90,26));
dot((75,0));
dot((105,0));
[/asy]
Then there are three ways to color the middle equilateral triangle:
int i;
pair transy = (0,-70);
for (i = 0; i <= 2; ++i) {
draw(shift(i*transy)*((-75,0)--(-45,0)--(-60,26)--cycle));
draw(shift(i*transy)*((0,0)--(30,0)--(15,26)--cycle));
draw(shift(i*transy)*((75,0)--(105,0)--(90,26)--cycle));
draw(shift(i*transy)*((-60,26)--(90,26)));
draw(shift(i*transy)*((-45,0)--(75,0)));
dot("B", (-75,0) + i*transy, S);
dot("W", (-45,0) + i*transy, S);
dot("R", (-60,26) + i*transy, N);
dot((15,26) + i*transy);
dot((0,0) + i*transy);
dot((30,0) + i*transy);
dot((90,26) + i*transy);
dot((75,0) + i*transy);
dot((105,0) + i*transy);
dot("B", (15,26), N);

dot("R", (0,0) + (0,-70), S);
dot("B", (30,0) + (0,-70), S);
dot("W", (15,26) + (0,-2*70), N);
dot("B", (0,0) + (0,-2*70), S);
dot("R", (30,0) + (0,-2*70), S);
[/asy]
Now we want to color the third equilateral triangle
For each case above, we are exactly in the same position as before, as when the first equilateral triangle was colored, and we wanted to color the second equilateral triangle
This means that in each case, there are three ways to color the third equilateral triangle.
Therefore, the total number of possible colorings is $6 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = \boxed{54}$.
From $E$ to $F$, it is 3 steps to the right and 1 step down, for a total of $\dbinom{4}{1} = \dfrac{4}{1} = 4$ different paths
From $F$ to $G$, it is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down, for a total of $\dbinom{5}{2} = \dfrac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10$ different paths
So there are $4 \times 10 = \boxed{40}$ paths from $E$ to $G$ that pass through $F$.
We will calculate the probability of her hearing every second of her favorite song and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that we're looking for
There are a total of $10!$ ways in which the 10 songs can be ordered
If her favorite song is the first song, she obviously hears the whole thing, and then there are $9!$ ways to order the other songs
If the first song is the 30 second song, then she will hear the entirety of her favorite song if and only if it is played as the second song, after which there are $8!$ ways to order the other songs
Finally, if the first song is the 1 minute song, she will hear her favorite song if and only if it is played as the second song, after which there are $8!$ ways to order the other songs
If the first song is longer than a minute, or if two songs are played before her first song, she won't have time to hear all of her favorite song in the first 4 minutes, 30 seconds
So out of the $10!$ ways of ordering the 10 songs, there are $9! + 8! + 8!$ ways that result in her hearing the full song for a probability of $\dfrac{9!+8!+8!}{10!}=\dfrac{8!}{8!}\cdot\dfrac{9+1+1}{10\cdot9}=\dfrac{11}{90}$
But that is the probability that what we want $\emph{doesn't}$ happen, so we need to subtract it from 1 to get our final probability of $1-\dfrac{11}{90}=\boxed{\dfrac{79}{90}}$
There are 50 numbers between 1-100 inclusive which are divisible by 2 --- all the even numbers
To avoid overcounting, we must find all the odd multiples of 3
Beginning with 3, the sequence of all such numbers is $3, 9, 15\cdots99$, which gives $\dfrac{99-3}{6}+1=17$ such numbers.
Finally, we must find all odd multiples of 5 which are not divisible by 3
These are 5, 25, 35, 55, 65, 85, and 95
This gives a final count of $50+17+7=74$ numbers between 1-100 inclusive which are multiples of 2, 3, or 5.
The probability that Alexio selects one of these is therefore $\boxed{\dfrac{37}{50}}$.
We don't consider the order that we choose integers in this problem, meaning that choosing a $-5$ and then a $-8$ is the same as choosing a $-8$ and then a $-5$
The product of two integers is negative if one integer is positive and the other is negative
There are three ways to choose a negative integer and two ways to choose a positive integer, for a total of $3\cdot2=6$ ways to choose both integers
There are $$\binom{5}{2}=\frac{5!}{2!3!}=10$$ ways to choose any two different integers, so the probability that the two integers have a negative product is $6/10=\boxed{\frac{3}{5}}$.
Of the digits 1 through 5, three are odd and two are even
If Jason's combination started with an odd digit, there would be 3 possibilities for the first digit
Since an even digit must follow, there would be 2 possibilities for the second digit
Similarly, there would be 3 possibilities for the third digit, and so on
This would be a total of: $$3\times2\times3\times2\times3=108$$We can apply the same logic if Jason's combination started with an even digit
There would be 2 possibilities for the first digit, 3 for the second digit, and so on, for a total of : $$2\times3\times2\times3\times2=72$$Overall, Jason must try $72+108=\boxed{180}$ combinations.
If a sequence contains no more than one 0, there are $7\cdot 6\cdot
5\cdot 4\cdot 3 = 2520$ sequences formed from the characters A, I, M, E, 2, 0, and 7
If a sequence contains two 0's, the 0's can be placed in $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways, the remaining characters can be chosen in $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways, and those remaining characters can be arranged in $3! = 6$ ways, for a total of $10\cdot 20\cdot 6
= 1200$ sequences
Thus $N = 2520 + 1200 = 3720$, and $\frac{N}{10}=
\boxed{372}$.
First, put the two missing segments in and count the number of paths from $A$ to $B$ on the complete grid
Each path from $A$ to $B$ consists of a sequence of 12 steps, three of which are ``down'' and nine of which are ``right.''  There are $\binom{12}{3}=220$ ways to arrange 3 D's and 9 R's, so there are 220 paths from $A$ to $B$.
Now we will count the number of paths that go through one of the forbidden segments
No path goes through both of them, so we may count the number of paths that go through each segment and sum the results
Define $C$ and $D$ as shown in the figure
There are 5 ways to get from $A$ to $C$ and 6 ways to get from $D$ to $B$
So there are $5\cdot 6=30$ ways to get from $A$ to $B$ through the first forbidden segment
Similarly, there are 30 ways to get from $A$ to $B$ through the second forbidden segment
So the total number of paths from $A$ to $B$ on the original grid is $220-30-30=\boxed{160}$.

Since we are told there are $20$ numbers in the first $4$ Rows, we want to find the $20^{\mathrm{th}}$ number starting in Row 5
Since there are $10$ numbers in Row 5, and there are $12$ numbers in Row 6, the $20^{\mathrm{th}}$ number if we start counting in Row 5 is located at the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$ spot of Row 6, which is of course a $\boxed{12}.$
We compute the probability that Mahmoud flips three tails and subtract from 1
The probability that Mahmoud flips one tail with one coin is $\frac{1}{2}$, so the probability that he flips three tails is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}$
The probability that he gets at least one head is $1- \frac{1}{8}= \boxed{\frac{7}{8}}$.
Since $\angle APB = 90^{\circ}$ if and only if $P$ lies on the semicircle with center $(2,1)$ and radius $\sqrt{5}$, the angle is obtuse if and only if the point $P$ lies inside this semicircle
The semicircle lies entirely inside the pentagon, since the distance, 3, from $(2,1)$ to $\overline{DE}$ is greater than the radius of the circle
Thus the probability that the angle is obtuse is the ratio of the area of the semicircle to the area of the pentagon.

[/asy] Let $O=(0,0)$, $A=(0,2)$, $B=(4,0)$, $C=(2\pi+1,0)$, $D=(2\pi+1,4)$, and $E=(0,4)$
Then the area of the pentagon is $$[ABCDE]=[OCDE]-[OAB] = 4\cdot(2\pi+1)-\frac{1}{2}(2\cdot4) = 8\pi,$$and the area of the semicircle is $$\frac{1}{2}\pi(\sqrt{5})^2 = \frac{5}{2}\pi.$$The probability is $$\frac{\frac{5}{2}\pi}{8\pi} = \boxed{\frac{5}{16}}.$$
There are $\binom{6}{3}$ ways for 3 of the dice to show even numbers and 3 of them to show odd numbers
Each roll is even with probability $\frac12$ and odd with probability $\frac12$, so each arrangement of 3 odd numbers and 3 even number occurs with probability $\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{\!6}$
Thus, the probability that 3 dice out of 6 show even numbers is \[\binom{6}{3}\frac{1}{2^6}=\boxed{\frac{5}{16}}.\]
There are 8 digits upon which the die can land in the first roll and 8 digits upon which the die can land in the second roll
Thus, there are $8 \cdot 8 = 64 $ pairs of digits that can result from two rolls
Of these, only two will produce a sum of 15: 8 and 7 or 7 and 8
Thus, the probability of rolling a 15 is $\frac{2}{64} = \boxed{\frac{1}{32}}$.
The total number of ways that the numbers can be chosen is $
\binom{40}{4}.
$ Exactly 10 of these possibilities result in the four slips having the same number.
Now we need to determine the number of ways that two slips can have a number $a$ and the other two slips have a number $b$, with $b\ne a$
There are $\binom{10}{2}$ ways to choose the distinct numbers $a$ and $b$
For each value of $a$, there are $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose the two slips with $a$ and for  each value of $b$, there are $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose the two slips with $b$
Hence the number of ways that two slips have some  number $a$ and the other two slips have some distinct number $b$ is \[
\binom{10}{2}\cdot\binom{4}{2}\cdot\binom{4}{2}=45\cdot 6\cdot6 =1620.
\]So the probabilities $p$ and $q$ are $\displaystyle \frac{10}{\binom{40}{4}}$ and $\displaystyle \frac{1620}{\binom{40}{4}}$,   respectively, which implies that \[
\frac{q}{p} = \frac{1620}{10} = \boxed{162}.
First we count the arrangements if the two I's are unique, which is 5!
Then since the I's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ for the arrangements of the I's, for an answer of $\dfrac{5!}{2!} = \boxed{60}$.
Since for all $n \ge 10$, $n!$ has (at least) two factors of 5, we know that $n!$ will end in two zeros
Therefore, if $n\ge 10$, then $n!$ contributes nothing to the last two digits of the sum
So we need only compute $5! = 120$, and hence our answer is $\boxed{20}$.
The presence of cities $C$ and $E$ is irrelevant to the problem, because upon entering either city, there is only one road going out
Therefore, we can remove those cities, and instead note that there are two roads connecting $A$ and $D,$ two roads connecting $B$ and $D,$ and one road connecting $A$ and $B.$ We can assume that the order in which each pair of roads is traversed does not matter, and then multiply by $2 \cdot 2 =4$ at the end.
Now, take cases on whether $B$ or $D$ is visited first:
Suppose $D$ is visited first
If the other road back to $A$ is then taken, then the only possibility is to travel to $B$ and then travel the two roads between $B$ and $D$ in either order
If, instead, one of the roads to $B$ is taken, then either $A, D, B$ must be visited in that order, or $D, A, B$ must be visited in that order
This gives $3$ possible routes in total.
Suppose $B$ is visited first
Then $D, A, D, B$ must be visited in that order, so there is only one possible route.
Putting the two cases together and multiplying by $4$ gives the answer, $4(1+3) = \boxed{16}.$
First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $5!$
Then since the M's and the A's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ twice for the arrangements of M's and the arrangements of A's, for an answer of $\dfrac{5!}{2! \times 2!} = \boxed{30}$.
We compute the probability that the sum is three or less and subtract from 1
A sum of 2 or 3 can be obtained only with the following tosses: $(1,1), (2,1), (1,2)$
There are 36 total toss possibilities, so the probability of getting a sum of 2 or 3 is $\frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}$
Therefore, the probability of getting a sum greater than 3 is $1-\frac{1}{12} = \boxed{\frac{11}{12}}$.
The sum of two prime numbers is greater than $2$, so if this sum is to be prime, it must be odd
Therefore, one of the primes in the sum must be $2$, and the other must be odd
The first eight prime numbers are $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,$ and $19$
Of the odd ones, only $3, 5, 11$, and $17$ added to $2$ give a prime number
Therefore, there are $4$ possible pairs whose sum is prime
The total number of pairs is $\dbinom{8}{2}=28$
So the probability is $\frac{4}{28}=\boxed{\frac17}$.
To start, we can clearly draw $1\times1$,$2\times2$,$3\times3$,and $4\times4$ squares
Next, we must consider the diagonals
We can draw squares with sides of $\sqrt{2}$ and $2\sqrt{2}$ as shown: [asy]
draw((1,4)--(0,3)--(1,2)--(2,3)--cycle,blue);
draw((2,4)--(0,2)--(2,0)--(4,2)--cycle,red);
dot((0,0));dot((1,0));dot((2,0));dot((3,0));dot((4,0));
dot((0,1));dot((1,1));dot((2,1));dot((3,1));dot((4,1));
dot((0,2));dot((1,2));dot((2,2));dot((3,2));dot((4,2));
dot((0,3));dot((1,3));dot((2,3));dot((3,3));dot((4,3));
dot((0,4));dot((1,4));dot((2,4));dot((3,4));dot((4,4));
[/asy] In addition, we can draw squares with side lengths diagonals of $1\times 2$ and $1\times 3$ rectangles as shown: [asy]
draw((2,4)--(0,3)--(1,1)--(3,2)--cycle,red);
draw((3,4)--(0,3)--(1,0)--(4,1)--cycle,blue);
dot((0,0));dot((1,0));dot((2,0));dot((3,0));dot((4,0));

dot((0,2));dot((1,2));dot((2,2));dot((3,2));dot((4,2));
dot((0,3));dot((1,3));dot((2,3));dot((3,3));dot((4,3));
dot((0,4));dot((1,4));dot((2,4));dot((3,4));dot((4,4));
[/asy] Any larger squares will not be able to fit on the lattice
There are a total of $4+2+2=\boxed{8}$ possible squares.
Since each day it either snows or doesn't snow, we know that the sum of the probabilities of those two events is 1, which means that the probability of it not snowing on any one day is $1-\frac{2}{3}=\frac{1}{3}$
That means the probability of it $\emph{not}$ snowing on all three days is $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{27}$, and once again we know that the probabilities of complementary events sum to 1, so the probability that we're looking for is $1-\frac{1}{27}=\boxed{\dfrac{26}{27}}$.
Let $a$ be the number of elements in set $A$ and $b$ be the total number of elements in set $B$
We are told that the total number of elements in set $A$ is twice the total number of elements in set $B$ so we can write  $$a=2b.$$ Since there are 1000 elements in the intersection of set $A$ and set $B$, there are $a-1000$ elements that are only in set $A$ and $b-1000$ elements only in set $B$
The total number of elements in the union of set $A$ and set $B$ is equal to $$\mbox{elements in only }A+\mbox{elements in only }B+\mbox{elements in both}$$ which we can also write as  $$(a-1000)+(b-1000)+1000.$$ Because we know that there is a total of 3011 elements in the union of $A$ and $B$, we can write  $$(a-1000)+(b-1000)+1000=3011$$ which simplifies to $$a+b=4011.$$  Because $a=2b$ or $b=\frac{1}{2}a$, we can write the equation in terms of $a$ and then solve for $a$
We get  \begin{align*}
a+b&=4011\qquad\implies\\
a+\frac{1}{2}a&=4011\qquad\implies\\
\frac{3}{2}a&=4011\qquad\implies\\
a&=2674\\
\end{align*} Therefore, the total number of elements in set $A$ is $\boxed{2674}.$
We write the sequence of columns in which the integers are written: \[B,C,D,E,D,C,B,A,B,C,D,E,\ldots.\] We see that the sequence consists of the block \[B,C,D,E,D,C,B,A\] repeated over and over.
Now, note that 800 will be the $799^{\text{th}}$ number in the list $\allowbreak \{2,3,4,\ldots,\}$
When 799 is divided by 8, its remainder is 7, so 800 will be written in the same column in which the seventh number is written
This is column B.
As another solution, we could note that all multiples of 8 appear in column B, so 800 must be in column $\boxed{\text{B}}$.
The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q
So the only choices are for the middle two letters
The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S
Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters
So, there are $4 \cdot 3 = \boxed{12}$ sequences.
We can really construct this scenario precisely: the first toss can be anything, then the second toss can be all but what the first toss was, the third toss can be all but what the second toss was, etc., up through the ninth toss
The tenth toss, though, must be exactly what the ninth toss was
So, the probability is the product of the probabilities that the second to ninth tosses are all different than the previous toss and the tenth is the same of the ninth: $1 \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5^8}{6^9} \approx \boxed{.039}$.
No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle
Choosing 3 out of 12 is $\binom{12}{3}=\boxed{220}.$
The "at least" is a clue to try complementary counting -- we count number of numbers with no 5's at all, and subtract this from 600, since there are 600 numbers from 1 to 600.
To make a number with no 5's at all that is less than 600, we have 5 choices for the first number: 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4
(We have to remember to include 600 at the end.)  We can use any digit besides 5 for the tens and for the units digit, so we have 9 choices for each of these digits
This gives us a total of $5\cdot 9\cdot 9 = 405$ numbers less than 600 with no 5's
However, this count includes 000, and doesn't include 600
(Always be careful about extremes!)  Including 600 and excluding 000, we still have 405 numbers less than 600 with no 5's, so we have $600-405 = \boxed{195}$ numbers with at least one 5.
There are three ways to draw two blue marbles and a red one: RBB, BRB, and  BBR
Since there are no overlapping outcomes, these are distinct cases and their sum is the total probability that two of the three drawn will be blue
The desired probability therefore is  \[\frac{10}{16}\cdot\frac{6}{15}\cdot\frac{5}{14} + \frac{6}{16}\cdot\frac{10}{15}\cdot\frac{5}{14} + \frac{6}{16}\cdot\frac{5}{15}\cdot\frac{10}{14} = \boxed{\frac{15}{56}}.\]
By the Binomial theorem, this term is $$\binom82 \left(\frac{3}{5}x\right)^2\left(-\frac{y}{2}\right)^6=28\cdot\frac{9}{25}\cdot\frac{1}{64}x^2y^6=\boxed{\frac{63}{400}}x^2y^6$$
There's a $\dfrac{1}{3}$ chance that I will select each club
Let $n$ be the number of students in that club
There are $\dbinom{n}{3}$ ways to choose a group of three students at a math club with $n$ members
Only $\dbinom{n-2}{1}$ of these groups will contain the two co-presidents
Once I have selected that club, the probability that I give books to the co-presidents is $\dfrac{\dbinom{n-2}{1}}{\dbinom{n}{3}}$
Since the clubs have 5, 7, and 8 students, this means that the total probability is $$\dfrac{1}{3}\left(\dfrac{\dbinom{5-2}{1}}{\dbinom{5}{3}}+\dfrac{\dbinom{7-2}{1}}{\dbinom{7}{3}}+\dfrac{\dbinom{8-2}{1}}{\dbinom{8}{3}}\right)$$which after a bit of arithmetic simplifies to $\boxed{\dfrac{11}{60}}$.
Since for all $n \ge 10$, $n$ has two factors of 5, $n$ will end in two zeros, and so contributes nothing to the last two digits
So we need only compute $1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! + 6! + 7! + 8! + 9! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 + 120 + 720 + 5040 + 40320 + 362880$, and the relevant digits add up to $1 + 2 + 6 + 24 + 20 + 20 + 40 + 20 + 80$ whose last two digits are $\boxed{13}$.
We proceed by counting the complement, or the number of invalid 3-word sentences
A sentence is invalid precisely when it is of the form ``(word) splargh glumph'' or ``splargh glumph (word).''  There are 3 choices for the missing word in each sentence, and since each case is exclusive, we have a total of 6 invalid sentences
Since there are $3\cdot 3\cdot 3 = 27$ possible 3-word sentences with no restrictions, there are $27-6 = \boxed{21}$ that satisfy the restrictions of the problem.
Let $x$ be the number of kids in the French class not including Max and Liz and let $y$ be the number of kids in the English class not including Max and Liz
Since all 25 kids are either just in English, just in French, or in both (Max and Liz), we know that $x+y+2=25$ or $x+y=23$
Furthermore, we know that $2(x+2)=y+2$ since $x+2$ and $y+2$ represent the total number of kids in each of the two classes
Rewriting the last equation gives us $2x+2=y$ which can be substituted into the first equation to give us $x+(2x+2)=23$, which gives $x=7$
Substituting this value into any of the equations gives us $y=\boxed{16}$.
Since $7^2 < 50 < 8^2$ and $15^2 < 250 < 16^2$, the squares between 50 and 250 are $8^2,9^2,10^2,\ldots,15^2$
So there are $15 - 8 + 1 = \boxed{8}$ such squares.
Since the ant starts at the top vertex, his next destination, vertex A, is equally likely to be any of the 4 vertices along the middle ring
Each of these vertices is adjacent to 4 other vertices, and since they are in the middle, exactly 1 of those 4 vertices is the bottom vertex
So, regardless of which intermediate vertex he goes to, the ant will end up at the bottom vertex with $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$ probability, by the symmetry of the 4 intermediate stages.
There are ${9 \choose 2} = 36$ pairs of plates possible in all
Exactly ${5 \choose 2} = 10$ of these pairs are both red plates and $\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs are both blue plates for a total of $6+10=16$ pairs of plates that satisfy our condition
So, the probability of the pair of plates being the same color is $\frac{16}{36}=\boxed{\frac{4}{9}}$.
If there are $5$ people, we can arrange then in $5\cdot 4\cdot 3 = 60$ ways
Since we don't care about order, we've overcounted
There are $3\cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6$ ways to arrange $3$ people, so our answer is
\frac{60}{6} = \boxed{10}.
$$Alternatively, the number of groups of three that five people can make (without regard to the order the groups) is $\binom{5}{3}=\frac{5!}{3!2!}=\boxed{10}$.
The 9 arrangements $(9,1)$, $(8,2)$, $\ldots$, $(1,9)$ use two stamps
The sets $(1,2,7)$, $(1,3,6)$, $(1,4,5)$, $(2,3,5)$ each use three distinct stamps, and each one gives $3!=6$ arrangements
The other sets which use three stamps are $(2,2,6)$, $(3,3,4)$, and $(4,4,2)$, and each one gives 3 different arrangements
In total, there are $4 \times 6 + 3 \times 3=33$ arrangements which use 3 stamps
There are 24 arrangements of the stamps $(1,2,3,4)$, 12 arrangements of $(1,2,2,5)$, 6 arrangements of $(2,2,3,3)$, and 4 arrangements of $(1,3,3,3)$
In total, there are 46 ways to use 4 stamps to make 10 cents in postage
Altogether, there are $9+33+46=\boxed{88}$ arrangements of stamps which sum to 10 cents.
To get $x^3$ and $\frac1{x^3}$, we cube $x+\frac1x$: $$-125=(-5)^3=\left(x+\frac1x\right)^3=x^3+3x+\frac3x+\frac1{x^3}$$ by the Binomial Theorem
Conveniently, we can evaluate $3x +
\frac{3}{x}$ as  $3\left(x+\frac1x\right)=3(-5)=-15$, so $$x^3+\frac1{x^3}=(-125)-(-15)=\boxed{-110}.$$
To meet the first condition, numbers which sum to $50$ must be chosen from the set of squares $\{1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49\}.$ To meet the second condition, the squares selected must be different
Consequently, there are three possibilities: $1+49,$ $1+4+9+36,$ and $9+16+25.$ These correspond to the integers $17,$ $1236,$ and $345,$ respectively
The largest is $1236,$ and the product of its digits is $1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot6=\boxed{36}.$
The number of pairs of adjacent cards which are both black is equal to the number of black cards which have another black card to their right
For each black card, there is a $\dfrac{25}{51}$ chance that the card to its right is also black, giving 1 pair, and a $\dfrac{26}{51}$ chance that the card to its right is red, giving 0 pairs
There are 26 black cards, so the expected value of the number of pairs of adjacent black cards is $$26\left(\frac{25}{51}(1)+\frac{26}{51}(0)\right)=\boxed{\frac{650}{51}}$$
It is clear that the maximal positive difference is $6 - 1 = 5$
Moreover, we can use 6 to ensure that we can get all positive integer differences up to 5: $6 - 5 = 1$, $6 - 4 = 2$, $6 - 3 = 3$, $6 - 2 = 4$, $6 - 1 = 5$
So, there are $\boxed{5}$ possible differences.
There are 26 ways to choose the first letter and 10 ways to choose the last digit
Then, since the middle digit must be the same as either the first letter or the last digit, there are 2 ways to choose the middle digit
Therefore, there are a total of $26\cdot10\cdot2=\boxed{520}$ possible license plates I can choose.
To see which points in the rectangle satisfy $x>2y$, we rewrite the inequality as $y<\frac{1}{2}x$
This inequality is satisfied by the points below the line $y=\frac{1}{2}x$
Drawing a line with slope $\frac{1}{2}$ and $y$-intercept 0, we obtain the figure below
We are asked to find the ratio of the area of the shaded triangle to the area of the rectangle
The vertices of the triangle are $(0,0), (2008,0)$, and $(2008,2008/2)$, so the ratio of areas is  \[
\frac{\frac{1}{2}(2008)\left(\frac{2008}{2}\right)}{2008(2009)}=\frac{2008/4}{2009}=\boxed{\frac{502}{2009}}.

Including 2001 and 2004, there are 4 years total
However, 2004 is a leap year
Therefore, the number of days is $4\times 365 + 1 = \boxed{1461}$.
In eight of the twelve outcomes the product is even: $1\times 2$, $2\times
1$, $2\times 2$, $2\times 3$, $3\times 2$, $4\times 1$, $4\times 2$, $4\times 3$
In four of the twelve, the product is odd: $1\times 1$, $1\times 3$, $3\times 1$, $3\times 3$
So the probability that the product is even is $\frac{8}{12}$ or $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
To get an odd product, the result of both spins must be odd
The probability of odd is $\frac{1}{2}$ on Spinner $A$ and $\frac{2}{3}$ on Spinner $B$
So the probability of an odd product is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)=\frac{1}{3}$
The probability of an even product, then, is $1-\frac{1}{3}=\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
Use two-letter strings to denote the results of the two spins
For example, RL denotes spinning ``move one space right'' followed by ``move one space left.'' If Jeff starts at a multiple of 3, the only ways he can end up at a multiple of 3 are to spin LR or RL
The probability of starting at a multiple of 3 is $\frac{3}{10}$, and the probability of spinning LR or RL is $\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{3}=\frac{4}{9}$
Multiplying these probabilities, we find that the probability that Jeff will start at a multiple of 3 and reach a multiple of 3 is $\frac{12}{90}$.
If Jeff starts at a number which is one more than a multiple of 3, the only way for him to reach a multiple of 3 for him to spin RR
The probability of selecting 1, 4, 7, or 10 is $\frac{4}{10}$, and the probability of spinning RR is $\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{2}{3}=\frac{4}{9}$
The probability that Jeff will start one unit to the right of a multiple of 3 and end up at a multiple of 3 is $\frac{16}{90}$.
If Jeff starts at a number which is one less than a multiple of 3, the only way for him to reach a multiple of 3 for him to spin LL
The probability of selecting 2, 5, or 8 is $\frac{3}{10}$, and the probability of spinning LL is $\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{9}$
The probability that Jeff will start one unit to the left of a multiple of 3 and end up at a multiple of 3 is $\frac{3}{90}$.
In total, the probability that Jeff will reach a multiple of 3 is $\dfrac{12}{90}+\dfrac{3}{90}+\dfrac{16}{90}=\boxed{\frac{31}{90}}$.
The number of all seating arrangements is $8!$
The number of seating arrangements in which John, Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\times 3!$
We can arrive at $6!\times 3!$ by considering John, Wilma and Paul as one person, arranging the ``six'' people (the JWP super-person plus the 5 other people) first, then arranging John, Wilma and Paul
Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $$8!-6!\times 3!=8\times 7\times 6! - 6!\times 3! = (8\times 7 - 3!)6! = (50)(720)=\boxed{36000}.$$
The first $66$ digits are $33$ two-digit integers
The first $33$ integers written are $50$ to $18$
Thus the $67^{\text{th}}$ digit is the first digit of $17$, which is $\boxed{1}$.
We first find the areas of the triangles under $l$ and $m$ and in the first quadrant
From $l$'s equation, we find that at $x = 6$, $y = 0$
From $m$, we find that at $x = \frac{3}{2}$, we find that $y = 0$.
We then find the areas using the formula for a triangle: $\frac{1}{2}bh$
The area under $l$ is $\frac{1}{2}(6\times 6) = 18$
The area under $m$ is $\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{3}{2}\times 6\right) = \frac{9}{2}$
Thus, the probability that the point selected will fall between $l$ and $m$ has probability $\frac{18 - \frac{9}{2}}{18} = \frac{27/2}{18} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75$
Thus, the probability is $\boxed{0.75}$.
Let us consider the number of three-digit integers that do not contain $3$ and $5$ as digits; let this set be $S$
For any such number, there would be $7$ possible choices for the hundreds digit (excluding $0,3$, and $5$), and $8$ possible choices for each of the tens and ones digits
Thus, there are $7 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 448$ three-digit integers without a $3$ or $5$.
Now, we count the number of three-digit integers that just do not contain a $5$ as a digit; let this set be $T$
There would be $8$ possible choices for the hundreds digit, and $9$ for each of the others, giving $8 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 648$
By the complementary principle, the set of three-digit integers with at least one $3$ and no $5$s is the number of integers in $T$ but not $S$
There are $648 - 448 = \boxed{200}$ such numbers.
Each game has 5 players
The games that we are counting include Justin, Tim, and 3 of the 8 other players
There are $\binom{8}{3}$ = 56 such match-ups.
Alternatively, There are $\binom{10}{5}$ = 252 different possible match-ups involving 5 of the 10 players
By symmetry, every player plays in exactly half of them, 126 games
In each of the 126 games that Tim plays, he plays with 4 of the other 9 players
Again by symmetry, he plays with each of those 9 players in 4/9 of his games
So he plays against Justin in 4/9 of 126 games, or $\boxed{56}$ games.
There are 26 choices of letters for each of the first two spots and 10 choices of digits for the next spot
Once the first digit has been chosen, we know whether the second digit must be even or odd
Either way, there are 5 choices for the second digit
There are a total of $26^2 \times 10 \times 5 = \boxed{33,\!800}$ different plates.
To be divisible by 6, a number must have its digits add up to a multiple of 3, and be even
Therefore, for the hundreds place, the possible digits are $\{5,6,7,8,9\}$, for the tens place the possible digits also are $\{5,6,7,8,9\}$, and for the ones digit, you can only choose from $\{6,8\}$.
First, let us choose 6 for the ones place
The other two digits must add up to a multiple of 3, making a total of 8 pairs that satisfy that condition: $$\{5,7\}, \{6,6\}, \{6,9\}, \{7,5\}, \{7,8\}, \{8,7\}, \{9,6\}, \{9,9\}.$$
Next, let us choose 8 for the ones place
The other two digits must be congruent to 1 mod 3, making a total of 8 pairs that satisfy that condition: $$\{5,5\}, \{5,8\}, \{6,7\}, \{7,6\}, \{7,9\}, \{8,5\}, \{8,8\}, \{9,7\}.$$
This makes a total of $\boxed{16}$ numbers.
We could solve this problem using casework, but using a little bit of symmetry and complementary probability gives us a more elegant solution
Since each coin flips heads or tails with equal probability, by the principle of symmetry the probability of getting fewer heads than tails is the equal to the probability of getting fewer tails than heads
Additionally, there are only three possible outcomes: getting fewer heads than tails, getting fewer tails than heads, or getting the same number of both
If we let $x$ represent the probability of the first outcome (which is the same as the probability of the second outcome) and $y$ represent the probability of the third outcome, we get the equation $2x + y = 1 \Rightarrow x=\dfrac{1-y}{2}$
So all we need to do is calculate the probability of getting the same number of heads and tails and we can then easily solve for what we want using the principle of complementary probability
Since there are two equally likely outcomes for each flip, there are a total of $2^{10}$ equally likely possible outcomes for flipping the 10 coins
We will have the same number of both heads and tails if we have exactly 5 of each, which we can count by selecting 5 out of the 10 flips to be heads which can occur in $\binom{10}{5}=252$ ways
So $y=\dfrac{252}{1024}=\dfrac{63}{256}$, and substituting that back into our first equation gives us the probability that we want: $x=\boxed{\dfrac{193}{512}}$.
From Pascal's identity $\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k}=\binom{n}{k}$.
Therefore, we have $\binom{26}{13}+\binom{26}{14}=\binom{27}{14}$, so $n=14$.
We know that $\binom{27}{14}=\binom{27}{27-14}=\binom{27}{13}$.
We use Pascal's identity again to get $\binom{26}{13}+\binom{26}{12}=\binom{27}{13}$, so $n=12$.
There are two values for $n$, $12$ and $14$, so the sum is $12+14=\boxed{26}$.
For positive integers $n$ greater than 4, $n!$ is divisible by 15
Therefore, all the terms beyond $1!+2!+3!+4!$ do not affect the remainder of the sum when it is divided by 15
The remainder when $1!+2!+3!+4!=33$ is divided by 15 is $\boxed{3}$.
The units digit of $1!$ is $1$, the units digit of $2!$ is $2$, the units digit of $3!$ is $6$, the units digit of $4! = 24$ is $4$, and the units digit of $5! = 120$ is $0$
For all $n \ge 5$, $n!$ is a multiple of $5!$, which is a multiple of 10, so all for all $n \ge 5$, the units digit of $n!$ is 0
This means that the units digit of the sum $1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! + \cdots + 1000!$ is just the units digit of $1 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 0 + \cdots + 0 = 13$, so the answer is $\boxed{3}$.
Make a list of the two-digit multiples of 19 and 31: 19, 31, 38, 57, 62, 76, 93, and 95
If we build the string from the beginning, we have different possibilities to check
For example, the second digit is 9, but the third digit could be 3 or 5
However, no units digit appears more than once, so if we build the string in reverse then the order is determined
If the 2002nd digit is 9, then the 2001st digit is 1, the 2000th digit is 3, the 1999th digit is 9, etc
Therefore, the first digit would be 9
So if the first digit is 1, then the final digit cannot be 9
If the 2002nd digit is 8, the the 2001st digit is 3, the 2000th digit is 9, the 1999th digit is 1, the 1998th digit is 3, etc
In this case, the first digit is 1, so the maximum possible last digit is $\boxed{8}$.
Bob is equally likely to end up rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
Three of these numbers are prime and two are composite, so there is a $\frac{3}{5}$ chance he will eat unsweetened cereal and a $\frac{2}{5}$ chance that he will eat sweetened cereal
In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, so the expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal is $\frac{3}{5}\cdot365=219$ and the expected value of the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal is $\frac{2}{5}\cdot365=146$
The difference between 219 days and 146 days is $\boxed{73}$ days.
Since each coin has 2 possible outcomes, there are $2^n$ possible outcomes for the $n$ coins
The number of outcomes in which the number of tails is 0 or 1 is $\binom{n}{0}+\binom{n}{1}=1+n$
So the probability of having at most one tail is $\dfrac{1+n}{2^n}$
Therefore, we must solve the equation $$ \frac{1+n}{2^n} =\frac{3}{16}
$$ We can check (simply by plugging in values of $n$) that if $1 \leq n \leq 5$, then $n=5$ is the only solution
Now we show that $n\geq 6$ cannot be a solution to the equation
Observe that $n\geq 6$ implies $n<2^{n-3}$, thus \[\frac{1+n}{2^n}<\frac{1+2^{n-3}}{2^n}=\frac{1}{2^n}+\frac{1}{8}<\frac{1}{16}+\frac{1}{8}=\frac{3}{16}.\] So there are $\boxed{5}$ coins.
At least one of the dice must come up 6, since otherwise the best we can do is 15
The other two dice must add up to 10
There are two ways two dice add to 10: $4+6$ and $5+5$.
So, we have two cases to consider:
A) The dice are 6, 6, 4
There are three possible ways this can happen, and the probability of each is $(1/6)^3 = 1/216$
So, the probability of this case is $3(1/216) = 1/72$.
B) The dice are 6, 5, 5
There are three possible ways this can happen, and the probability of each is $(1/6)^3 = 1/216$
So, the probability of this case is $3(1/216) = 1/72$.
Adding the probabilities of these two cases gives us a total probability of $\frac{1}{72} + \frac{1}{72} = \boxed{\frac{1}{36}}$.
By the Binomial Theorem applied to $(x+(-1))^9$, this term is $\binom98x^8(-1)^1=-9x^8$
The coefficient of this term is $\boxed{-9}$.
The number of all outfit combinations is $6\times 6\times 6=216$
There are 6 outfits in which all three items are the same color
Thus there are $216-6=\boxed{210}$ outfits in which not all three items are the same color.
The probability of rolling a number other than 1 on one die is $\frac{5}{6}$, so the probability of rolling zero 1's on two dice is $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{36}$
The probability of rolling a 1 on one die is $\frac{1}{6}$, so the probability of rolling 1's on two dice (for a total of two 1's) is $\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{36}$
Since the only other possibility is rolling exactly one 1, the probability of rolling one 1 is $1-\frac{25}{36}-\frac{1}{36} = \frac{10}{36}$
We find the expected number of 1's to be $E = \frac{1}{36} \cdot 2 + \frac{10}{36} \cdot 1 + \frac{25}{36} \cdot 0 = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
There are 3 different cases for the starting lineup.
Case 1: Bob starts (and Yogi doesn't)
In this case, the coach must choose 4 more players from the 10 remaining players (remember that Yogi won't play, so there are only 10 players left to select from)
Thus there are $\binom{10}{4}$ lineups that the coach can choose.
Case 2: Yogi starts (and Bob doesn't)
As in Case 1, the coach must choose 4 more players from the 10 remaining players
So there are $\binom{10}{4}$ lineups in this case.
Case 3: Neither Bob nor Yogi starts
In this case, the coach must choose all 5 players in the lineup from the 10 remaining players
Hence there are $\binom{10}{5}$ lineups in this case
To get the total number of starting lineups, we add the number of lineups in each of the cases: $$ \binom{10}{4} + \binom{10}{4} + \binom{10}{5} = 210 + 210 + 252 = \boxed{672}
From 1 to 5 books can be in the library, and the rest are checked out
Therefore, there are $\boxed{5}$ possibilities.
There are $\binom{7}{2} = 21$ ways in which Mary and James can choose 2 chairs, if we don't worry about the order in which they sit
Although we can use casework to count the number of ways they can choose chairs which are not next to each other, it is easier to use complementary counting
If we number the chairs $\#1, \#2, \ldots, \#7$ in order, then there are 6 ways Mary and James can choose chairs next to each other: they can sit in the first two chairs, or chairs $\#2$ and $\#3,$ or chairs $\#3$ and $\#4,$ etc., up to chairs $\#6$ and $\#7.$  Therefore $ P(\text{they sit next to each other}) = \frac{6}{21} = \frac{2}{7}, $ and therefore $ P(\text{they don't sit next to each other}) = 1-\frac{2}{7} = \boxed{\frac{5}{7}}
Michael can choose in $\binom{8}{3}=\boxed{56}$ ways.
From Pascal's identity $\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k}=\binom{n}{k}$.
Therefore, we have $\binom{20}{11}+\binom{20}{10}=\binom{21}{11}$, so $n=11$.
We know that $\binom{21}{11}=\binom{21}{21-11}=\binom{21}{10}$.
We use Pascal's identity again to get $\binom{20}{9}+\binom{20}{10}=\binom{21}{10}$, so $n=9$.
There are two values for $n$, $9$ and $11$, so the sum is $9+11=\boxed{20}$.
There are a total of $2^6=64$ equally likely sequences of heads and tails we could record from the fair coin, since heads and tails are equally likely for each of the six tosses
This is the denominator of our probability
Now, we need the number of sequences that contain exactly two heads
We can think of this as counting the number of sequences of T and H of length six where H appears exactly twice
The number of such sequences will be equal to the number of ways to choose the two positions for H, which is $\dbinom{6}{2}=15$
Thus, the final probability is $\boxed{\frac{15}{64}}$.
The only way for the sum to be a 14 is for her coin flip to be a 10 and for her roll to be a 4
This can only occur in $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \boxed{\frac{1}{12}}$.
Let $h$ be the distance from $P$ to $CB$
The area of triangle $ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2}(AC)(CB)$
The area of triangle $PBC$ is $\frac{1}{2}(h)(CB)$
Therefore, the area of triangle $PBC$ is less than one-half of the area of triangle $ABC$ if $h<AC/2$
This happens if $P$ falls below the dashed line whose endpoints are the midpoints $D$ and $E$ of $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{AB}$
Triangle $ADE$ is similar to triangle $ACB$, so the ratio of the area of triangle $ADE$ to the area of triangle $ACB$ is $\left(\frac{AD}{AC}\right)^2=\frac{1}{4}$
Therefore, the ratio of the area of trapezoid $DEBC$ to the area of triangle $ABC$ is $1-\dfrac{1}{4}=\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.

Each roll is independent of every other roll, so the probability of getting a $1$ on any given roll is $\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of not getting a $1$ on any given roll is $\frac{5}{6}$
Since we are looking for a $1$ rolled three times and a number not $1$ rolled once, we have $\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{5}{6}$
Now, we have to consider the order of the rolls
The number that is not a $1$ could be rolled on the first, second, third, or fourth roll, so we multiply by four
Hence, the probability of rolling $1$ exactly three times is $4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \boxed{\frac{5}{324}}$.
The three-digit numbers start with $100$ and end with $999$
There are $999-100+1=\boxed{900}$ three-digit numbers.
There are $\binom{11}{2} = 55$ combinations of two balls that can be drawn
There are $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ combinations of two white balls that can be drawn
So the probability that two balls pulled out are both white is $\dfrac{10}{55} = \boxed{\dfrac{2}{11}}$.
By the triangle inequality, three segments form a triangle if and only if the sum of the smaller two lengths exceeds the greatest length
Therefore, if $2$ is one of the sticks drawn, then the three sticks cannot be used to form a triangle
If 3 is the smallest length drawn, then the possible sets of sticks are (3,5,7) and (3,11,13)
If 5 is the smallest length drawn, then (5,7,11), (5,11,13), and (5,13,17) are the sets that satisfy the triangle inequality
If 7 is the smallest length drawn, then (7,11,13), (7,11,17), (7,13,17) all satisfy the triangle inequality
Finally, (11,13,17) satisfies the triangle inequality
In total, there are $2+3+3+1=9$ sets of sticks that could be used to form a triangle
There are $\binom{7}{3}=35$ equally likely sets of 3 sticks, so the probability that one of the 9 sets that form a triangle will be chosen is $\boxed{\frac{9}{35}}$.
The total number of marbles is $2+3+10=15$
The probability that the first marble drawn will be red is $2/15$
Then, there will be one red left, out of 14
Therefore, the probability of drawing out two red marbles will be: $$\frac{2}{15}\cdot\frac{1}{14}=\boxed{\frac{1}{105}}$$
There are three different possibilities for our first decision, each corresponding to which container we choose
So, if we choose container A, with $\frac{1}{3}$ probability, we have a $\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$ probability of drawing green, which means we have  a $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{5} = \frac{1}{5}$ of picking Container A and then picking a green ball
Similarly for container B the probability is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{15}$, and the same for container C
So, the total probability is $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{15} + \frac{2}{15} =\boxed{ \frac{7}{15}}$.
Since the two groups of two will each have one man and one woman, the group of three will have one man and two women
There are $\binom{3}{1}=3$ ways to choose the man to be in the group of three, and $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the women in the group of three
After they have been chosen, there are 2 ways to pair up the remaining two men and women
Therefore, the total number of ways to place the people in groups is $3\cdot 6\cdot 2=\boxed{36}$.
We consider all the two-element subsets of the six-element set $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$
There are ${6 \choose 2} = 15$ such subsets
And of these, only the subsets $\{ 2, 4 \}, \{2, 6 \}, \{3, 6 \}, \{ 4, 6 \}$ are not relatively prime
So the probability of the two-element subset's elements having greatest common factor one is $1 - \frac{4}{15} =\boxed{ \frac{11}{15}}$.
In this problem we don't care which box is which, we only care which balls are together and which ones aren't.
For each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in
Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together
Hence there are $2^4 = 16$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.
We then divide by the number of ways to arrange the boxes
There are $2!=2$ ways to arrange the 2 boxes, so there are $\frac{16}{2} = \boxed{8}$ ways to arrange 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes.
Note: This method does not generalize if there are more than 2 boxes.
There are $6^6$ different possible rolls exhibited by the six dice
If the six dice yield distinct numbers, then there are $6$ possible values that can appear on the first die, $5$ that can appear on the second die, and so forth
Thus, there are $6!$ ways to attain $6$ distinct numbers on the die
The desired probability is $\frac{6!}{6^6} = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{6 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 \cdot 6} = \frac{20}{6 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 \cdot 6} = \frac{5}{2^2 \cdot 3^4} = \boxed{\frac{5}{324}}$.
The probability that the first is red is $\dfrac38$
Now with 7 remaining, the probability that the second is white is $\dfrac57$
The answer is $\dfrac38 \times \dfrac57 = \boxed{\dfrac{15}{56}}$.
There are $\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways to choose two members of the group, and there are $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose two girls
Therefore, the probability that two members chosen at random are girls is $\dfrac{10}{45} = \boxed{\dfrac{2}{9}}$.
If the product of their values is even, then at least one of the dice rolls must yield an even number
To find how many ways this is possible, we consider the complementary possibility: suppose that all of the dice rolls yield odd numbers
There are $3^4$ ways of this occurring, out of a total of $6^4$ possibilities
It follows that there are $6^4 - 3^4$ ways of obtaining at least one even value.
Now, we need to count how many ways we can obtain an odd sum
There must then be an odd number of odd numbers rolled, so there must be either one or three odd numbers rolled
If one odd number is rolled, then there are $4$ ways to pick which die yielded the odd number, and $3$ possibilities for each dice, yielding a total of $4 \cdot 3^4$ possibilities
If three odd numbers are rolled, then there are again $4$ ways to pick which die yielded the even number and $3$ possibilities for each dice, yielding $4 \cdot 3^4$
Thus, the desired probability is given by $\frac{4 \cdot 3^4 + 4\cdot 3^4}{6^4 - 3^4} = \frac{8}{2^4 - 1} = \boxed{\frac{8}{15}}$.
Every positive integer appears in Pascal's triangle!  The number 100 appears in the row that starts 1, 100
So, the answer is $\boxed{100}$
Tricky, tricky!
There are $\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose where the red lamps go, and $\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose which lamps are on
If the left lamp is blue and off, and the right lamp is red and on, there are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which of the remaining lamps are red, and $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which of the remaining lamps are on
Therefore, the probability is $\dfrac{6\cdot6}{20\cdot20}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{100}}$.
We first factor 180 into three positive integers from the set $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
Since $180 > 5^3 = 125,$ at least one of the integers must be 6
Since $180 > 5^2\cdot 6 = 150$, at least two integers must equal 6
Indeed, $180 = 5\cdot6\cdot6$ is the only such way to factor 180
Therefore, $(a,b,c) = (5,6,6), (6,5,6),(6,6,5)$ are the only possibilities for $a,b,c$
Each occurs with probability $\left(\frac16\right)^3 = \frac1{216}$, so the probability that $abc = 180$ is $3\cdot \frac1{216} = \boxed{\frac1{72}}$.
If all triplets are in the starting lineup, we are choosing the 3 remaining starters from 11 players, which can be done in  $\binom{11}{3} = \boxed{165}$ ways.
For a moment, consider empty fruit baskets
Now there are $6$ choices total for the apples: no apples, one apple, two apples, three, four, or all five apples
Similarly, there are $11$ choices total for the oranges
Thus, there are $6\cdot 11 = 66$ potential fruit baskets
But we must subtract one off of that because we counted empty fruit baskets, which aren't actually allowed
So there are $\boxed{65}$ possible fruit baskets.
${42!}/{40!} = \dfrac{42 \times 41 \times 40 \times 39 \times \cdots \times 1}{40 \times 39 \times \cdots \times 1} = 42 \times 41 = \boxed{1,\!722}$.
Let the polygon have $n$ sides
The number of diagonals then is $n(n-3)/2$, because each vertex is connected to $n-3$ other vertices by diagonals, but $n(n-3)$ counts each diagonal twice
We then have $$n=\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\implies 1=\frac{n-3}{2}\implies n=\boxed{5}$$
Let $n$ be the number of rectangles contained in the bottom row, and let $m$ be the number of rectangles in the bottom row which contain a shaded square
There are $n$ rectangles contained in the top row and $n$ rectangles spanning both rows, so there are $3n$ rectangles in the figure
Similarly, $3m$ rectangles contain a shaded square
The probability that a rectangle chosen at random includes a shaded square is $3m/3n=m/n$.
A rectangle contained in the bottom row is determined by choosing any two of the 2004 vertical segments as sides of the rectangle
Therefore, $n=\binom{2004}{2}=\frac{2004\cdot 2003}{2}=1002\cdot2003$
A rectangle in the bottom row which contains a shaded square is determined by choosing one side from among the 1002 vertical segments to the left of the shaded square and one side from among the 1002 vertical segments to the right of the shaded square
Therefore, $m=1002^2$
The probability that a rectangle chosen at random from the figure does not include a shaded square is $1-\dfrac{m}{n}=1-\dfrac{1002^2}{1002\cdot 2003}=1-\dfrac{1002}{2003}=\boxed{\dfrac{1001}{2003}}$.
Factor 8! and cancel 5 factors of 2 and 2 factors of 3:  \begin{align*}
8! &= 2^3\cdot7\cdot(2\cdot 3)\cdot5\cdot 2^2\cdot 3\cdot 2 \implies \\
\frac{8!}{2^5\cdot 3^2} &= \frac{2^3\cdot7\cdot(2\cdot 3)\cdot5\cdot 2^2\cdot3\cdot 2}{2^5\cdot3^2} \\
&=7\cdot 5\cdot 2^2 \\
&=14\cdot 10 \\
&= \boxed{140}.
\end{align*}
It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 5 or 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $142 \times 7 = 994$
Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7
The smallest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $20\times 5 = 100$, and the largest multiple of 5 that is a three digit number is $199\times 5 =995$
So there are $199-20+1=180$ multiples of 5.
Now notice that we have counted some numbers twice: those multiples of $5\times7=35$
The smallest multiple of 35 is $3\times 35 = 105$, the largest multiple of 35 is $28\times35 =980$
So there are $28-3+1=26$ multiples of 35.
We have 128 multiples of 7 and 180 multiples of 5, but we count 26 multiples twice
So, there are a total of $128+180-26 = 282$ distinct three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 (or both)
There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-282=\boxed{618}$ three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 nor 5.
If the orientation of the cube is fixed, there are $2^6 = 64$ possible arrangements of colors on the faces
There are \[
2\binom{6}{6}=2
\]arrangements in which all six faces are the same color and \[
2\binom{6}{5}=12
\]arrangements in which exactly five faces have the same color
In each of these cases the cube can be placed so that the four vertical faces have the same color
The only other suitable arrangements have four faces of one color, with the other color on a pair of opposing faces
Since there are three pairs of opposing faces, there are $2(3)=6$ such arrangements
The total number of suitable arrangements is therefore $2+12+6=20$, and the probability is $20/64= \boxed{\frac{5}{16}}$.
${9!}/{8!} = \dfrac{9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times \cdots \times 1}{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times \cdots \times 1} = \boxed{9}$.
Each outcome of rolling an octahedral (8-sided) die has probability $\frac18$, and the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8
So the expected value is $$ \frac18(1) + \frac18(2) + \frac18(3) + \frac18(4) + \frac18(5) + \frac18(6)+ \frac18(7)+ \frac18(8) = \frac{36}{8} = \boxed{4.5}
The given expression is the expansion of $(99+1)^3$
In general, the cube $(x+y)^3$ is \[(x+y)^3=1x^3+3x^2y+3xy^2+1y^3.\]   The first and last terms in the given expression are cubes and the middle two terms both have coefficient 3, giving us a clue that this is a cube of a binomial and can be written in the form \[(x+y)^3\]In this case, $x=99$ and $y=1$, so our answer is\[(99+1)^3\ = 100^3 = \boxed{1,\!000,\!000}\]
$\dbinom{1293}{1} = \dfrac{1293!}{1!1292!}=\dfrac{1293}{1}=\boxed{1293}.$
We have to use a little bit of casework to solve this problem because some numbers on the die have a positive difference of $2$ when paired with either of two other numbers (for example, $3$ with either $1$ or $5$) while other numbers will only have a positive difference of $2$ when paired with one particular number (for example, $2$ with $4$).
If the first roll is a $1,$ $2,$ $5,$ or $6,$ there is only one second roll in each case that will satisfy the given condition, so there are $4$ combinations of rolls that result in two integers with a positive difference of $2$ in this case
If, however, the first roll is a $3$ or a $4,$ in each case there will be two rolls that satisfy the given condition- $1$ or $5$ and $2$ or $6,$ respectively
This gives us another $4$ successful combinations for a total of $8.$
Since there are $6$ possible outcomes when a die is rolled, there are a total of $6\cdot6=36$ possible combinations for two rolls, which means our probability is $\dfrac{8}{36}=\boxed{\dfrac{2}{9}}.$
We can also solve this problem by listing all the ways in which the two rolls have a positive difference of $2:$ $$(6,4), (5,3), (4,2), (3,1), (4,6), (3,5), (2,4), (1,3).$$  So, we have $8$ successful outcomes out of $6\cdot 6 = 36$ possibilities, which produces a probability of $8/36 = 2/9.$
\begin{align*}
\dbinom{n}{n-1}&=\dfrac{n!}{(n-1)!~1!}\\
&=\dfrac{n\times(n-1)\times(n-2)\times(n-3)\times\cdots\times 2\times 1}{(n-1)\times (n-2)\times (n-3)\times \cdots \times 2\times 1}\\
&=\boxed{n}.
\end{align*}Also, $\binom{n}{n-1}$ is the number of ways to choose $n-1$ objects out of $n$
This is equivalent to choosing $1$ object not to use
Since there are $n$ different objects, there are $\boxed{n}$ ways to do this.
There are 30 days in June
The probability that it rains on exactly 0, 1, or 2 days is  \begin{align*}&\ \ \ \ \binom{30}{0}\bigg(\frac{1}{10}\bigg)^{\!0}\bigg(\frac{9}{10}\bigg)^{\!30}\\&+\binom{30}{1}\bigg(\frac{1}{10}\bigg)^{\!1}\bigg(\frac{9}{10}\bigg)^{\!29}\\&+\binom{30}{2}\bigg(\frac{1}{10}\bigg)^{\!2}\bigg(\frac{9}{10}\bigg)^{\!28} \\
&\approx \boxed{0.411}.\end{align*}
There are $6\cdot6=36$ possible outcomes when two dice are tossed
The greatest possible sum is 12 and the prime numbers less than 12 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
There is exactly one way to get a sum of 2 (1+1), exactly two ways to get 3 (1+2, 2+1), exactly four ways to get 5 (1+4, 4+1, 2+3, 3+2), exactly six ways to get 7 (1+6, 6+1, 2+5, 5+2, 3+4, 4+3), and exactly two ways to get 11 (5+6, 6+5)
Thus, exactly 15 of the 36 sums are prime
The probability that the sum is prime is $15/36=\boxed{\frac{5}{12}}$.
There are $\binom{7}{2} = 21$ pairs of points in the heptagon, and all but 7 (the sides of the heptagon) are diagonals, which means there are 14 diagonals
So there are $\binom{14}{2} = 91$ pairs of diagonals
Any four points on the heptagon uniquely determine a pair of intersecting diagonals
(If vertices $A,B,C,D$ are chosen, where $ABCD$ is a convex quadrilateral, the intersecting pair of diagonals are $AC$ and $BD$.)  So the number of sets of intersecting diagonals is the number of combinations of 4 points, which is $\binom{7}{4} = 35$
So the probability that a randomly chosen pair of diagonals intersect is $\dfrac{35}{91} = \boxed{\dfrac{5}{13}}$.
Let $\ell$ be the perpendicular bisector of segment $AC$
We note that the points that are closer to $A$ than they are to $C$ are the points that are on the same side of $\ell$ as $A$
defaultpen(1);
pair C=(0,0), A=(0,3), B=(4,0);
pair D = (A+B)/2;
pair E = (C+A)/2;
pair F = (B+C)/2;

pair EH = E + (-.5,0);

Since $ABC$ is a 3-4-5 right triangle with a right angle at $C$, $\ell$ is parallel to line $BC$
Since it passes through the midpoint of $AC$, it also passes through the midpoint of $AB$, which we'll call $D$.
Let $m$ be the perpendicular bisector of segment $BC$
As before, the points that are closer to $C$ than they are to $B$ are those that lie on the same side of $m$ as $A$, and $m$ also passes through $D$.
defaultpen(1);
pair C=(0,0), A=(0,3), B=(4,0);

pair E = (C+A)/2;

[/asy] The probability we want is then this rectangle's area divided by triangle $ABC$'s area
There are a few different ways to see that this ratio is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$
One way is to note that we can divide $ABC$ into 4 congruent triangles, 2 of which are shaded: [asy]
defaultpen(1);
pair C=(0,0), A=(0,3), B=(4,0);
pair D = (A+B)/2;
pair E = (C+A)/2;
pair F = (B+C)/2;

draw(C--D);
label("\(A\)",A,N);
label("\(B\)",B,(1,0));
label("\(C\)",C,SW);
label("\(D\)",D,NE);
[/asy] Another way is to notice that the rectangle's sides have length $\frac{3}{2}$ and $\frac{4}{2}$, so that the rectangle's area is $\frac{3 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 2}$
Since triangle $ABC$'s area is $\frac{3 \cdot 4}{2}$, it follows that the probability we seek is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$, as before.
There are $6!$ ways to place the beads on the bracelet, but we must divide by 6 for rotational symmetry (6 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the bracelet to get the same arrangement)
The answer is $\dfrac{6!}{6 \times 2} = \boxed{60}$.
The coefficient of $x^k$ in $(x+1)^{42}$ is $\binom{42}{k}\times 1^{42-k} = \binom{42}{k}$
Therefore, the answer is $\binom{42}{2} = \frac{42 \times 41}{2} = 21 \times 41 = \boxed{861}$.
There are $\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose 3 islands
For each of these choices, there is a probability of $\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3$ that the chosen islands have treasure and the remaining ones have neither treasure nor traps
Therefore, the probability that the pirate encounters exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is $20 \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 = \boxed{\frac{5}{54}}$.
By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \frac34(+\$3) + \frac14(-\$8) = \boxed{\$0.25}$.
We can use Pascal's identity $\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k}=\binom{n}{k}$ to find $\binom{24}{4}$ and $\binom{24}{5}$.
$$\binom{24}{4}=\binom{23}{3}+\binom{23}{4}=1771+8855=10626$$ $$\binom{24}{5}=\binom{23}{4}+\binom{23}{5}=8855+33649=42504$$
Now that we have $\binom{24}{4}$ and $\binom{24}{5}$, we can use Pascal's identity again to find $\binom{25}{5}$.
$$\binom{25}{5}=\binom{24}{4}+\binom{24}{5}=10626+42504=\boxed{53130}$$
The probability that Kim does not have a math test is equal to one minus the probability she does have a math test
So, the probability of not having a math test is $1 - \frac{4}{7} = \boxed{\frac{3}{7}}$.
First, we count the number of total outcomes
Each toss has 2 possibilities - heads or tails - so the 7 tosses have $2^7 = 128$ possible outcomes.
To count the number of outcomes with at least 5 heads, we need to use casework.
Case 1: 5 heads
To count the number of ways that 5 heads can come up, we simply need to choose 5 of the 7 tosses to be heads (the other 2 tosses will then automatically be tails)
So this can be done in $\binom{7}{5} = 21$ ways.
Case 2: 6 heads
Here we have to choose 6 of the tosses to be heads; this can be done in $\binom{7}{6} = 7$ ways.
Case 3: 7 heads
There's only 1 way to do this -- all 7 tosses must be heads.
So there are $21 + 7 + 1 = 29$ successful outcomes, hence the probability is $\boxed{\frac{29}{128}}$.
There are only two possible occupants for the driver's seat
After the driver is chosen, any of the remaining three people can sit in the front, and there are two arrangements for the other two people  in the back
Thus, there are $2\cdot 3\cdot 2 =
\boxed{12}$ possible seating arrangements.
We do some simplification, taking advantage of the fact that $n! = n\cdot (n-1)!$: \begin{align*}
\frac{9!\cdot 5!\cdot 2!}{8!\cdot 6!} &= \frac{9\cdot 8! \cdot 5! \cdot 2}{8!\cdot 6\cdot 5!}\\
&= \frac{9\cdot 2}{6}\\
&= \boxed{3}.
\end{align*}
We could have either two greens or two reds
The probability of drawing two greens is $\left(\dfrac{6}{10}\right)^{\!2}=\dfrac{9}{25}$
The probability of drawing two reds is $\left(\dfrac{4}{10}\right)^{\!2}=\dfrac{4}{25}$
So the answer is $\dfrac{9}{25} + \dfrac{4}{25} = \boxed{\dfrac{13}{25}}$.
In this set of integers, there are 5 tens digits: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
If 5 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 5 with each tens digit
Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10^5$
The total number of combinations of 5 integers is $\binom{50}{5}$
So the probability that 5 integers drawn all have the different tens digits is $$ \frac{10^5}{\binom{50}{5}} = \frac{100000}{2118760} = \boxed{\frac{2500}{52969}}
We denote a path from $A$ to $B$ by writing the labeled points visited, such as $A$-$C$-$B$ (first going to $C$ then to $B$).
Case 1: Path ends in $C$-$B$
There are clearly four such paths, which we can determine systematically; $A$-$C$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$C$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$F$-$C$-$B$, and $A$-$D$-$E$-$F$-$C$-$B$.
Case 2: Path ends in $F$-$B$
The possible paths are easy to determine systematically as $A$-$C$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$C$-$D$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$C$-$D$-$E$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$C$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$E$-$F$-$B$, yielding 6 possible paths.
Therefore there are a total of $\boxed{10}$ such paths.
Using the distributive property twice, \begin{align*}
5\cdot5!+4\cdot4!+4! &= 5\cdot5! + (4+1)\cdot4!\\
&=5\cdot5! + 5!\\
&=(5+1)\cdot5!\\
&=6!\\
&=\boxed{720}.
\end{align*}
This problem is a perfect candidate for complementary counting
It will be fairly difficult to try to count this directly, since there are lots of possible cases (just two are BBBBGGG and BGGBBGB, where B is a boy and G is a girl)
But there is only one way to assign genders to the seating so that no two boys are next to each other, and that is BGBGBGB
If we seat the children as BGBGBGB, then there are $4!$ orderings for the 4 boys, and $3!$ orderings for the 3 girls, giving a total of $4! \times 3! = 144$ seatings for the 7 children
These are the seatings that we don't want, so to count the seatings that we do want, we need to subtract these seatings from the total number of seatings without any restrictions
Since there are 7 kids, there are $7!$ ways to seat them
So the answer is $7! - (4! \times 3!) = 5040-144 = \boxed{4896}$.
$\dbinom{505}{505}=\dbinom{505}{0}=\boxed{1}.$
Since $12! = 12 \cdot 11!$, we can examine the sum better by factoring $11!$ out of both parts: $$ 11! + 12! = 11! + 12 \cdot 11! = 11!(1 + 12) = 11! \cdot 13
$$Since no prime greater than 11 divides $11!$, $\boxed{13}$ is the largest prime factor of $11! + 12!$.
Let $N = xy3$, where $x,y$ are digits
Then $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the number $xy$ is
But since $\frac{1}{3}$ of the two-digit integers are divisible by 3, our final probability is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
There is a $\dfrac{1}{2}$ probability of rolling an odd number and winning $\$0$, and a $\dfrac{1}{6}$ probability of winning each of $\$2$, $\$4$, or $\$6$
So $E = \dfrac{1}{2}\times \$0 + \dfrac{1}{6}\times(\$2+\$4+\$6) = \boxed{\$2}$.
We instead find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is greater than or equal to 11
Since each die's face contains the numbers 1-6, there are only 3 pairs of rolls that result in a sum greater than or equal to 11: (5,6), (6,5) and (6,6)
Since there are 6 possible results for the roll of each die, there are $6\times6=36$ possible pairs of rolls, so the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is not less than 11 is $\frac{3}{36}=\frac{1}{12}$
Using the idea of complementary probabilities, we know that the probability of an event happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not happening, so the probability of the sum of the numbers showing being less than 11 is $1-\frac{1}{12}=\boxed{\frac{11}{12}}$.
With a few initial observations, we realize that the hundreds digit cannot be greater than 1, because the digits 5 or 6 are needed to make a 3 digit integer but will not fit with the larger hundreds digit
Clearly one of the digits is 5, to contribute to the sum $120 = 5!$
Then since we have the hundreds digit of 1, $1! = 1$, we need a middle digit
After testing a few, 4 works, since $145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1+ 24 + 120 = \boxed{145}$.
We can choose 4 books from 6 in $\binom{6}{4}=\boxed{15}$ ways.
No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle
There are 8 ways to choose the first point, 7 ways to choose the second point, and 6 ways to choose the third point, but we must divide by $3!$ since order doesn't matter
So the answer is $\dfrac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3!} = \boxed{56}$.
We note that the points for which $x+y<3$ are those that lie below the line $x+y = 3$, or $y= -x + 3$
As the diagram below illustrates, these are all the points in the square except those in the triangle with vertices (2,1), (2,2), and (1,2).

Since this is a right triangle whose sides both of length 1, its area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1^2 = 1/2$
Since the square in question has side length 2, its area is $2^2 = 4$, so the shaded region has area $4 - 1/2 = 7/2$
Our probability is therefore $\dfrac{7/2}{4} = \boxed{\dfrac{7}{8}}$.
There are 4 choices of flavor, and $\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to choose two of the six toppings
The total number of combinations is $4\cdot 15=\boxed{60}$.
The row 1, 1 has 2 numbers
The row 1, 2, 1 has 3 numbers
The row 1, 3, 3, 1 has 4 numbers
Each time we go down one row, we have one more number in the list
So, the row that starts 1, $k$ has $k+1$ numbers (namely, the numbers $\binom{k}{0}, \binom{k}{1}, \binom{k}{2}, \ldots, \binom{k}{k}$.)  So the row with 43 numbers starts 1, $\boxed{42}$.
Since the order that we choose the cooks in doesn't matter, we can choose 2 of them out of 8 trip members in $\binom{8}{2}=\boxed{28}$ ways.
There are $9!$ ways to arrange 9 people in a line, however there are 9 identical rotations for each arrangement, so we divide by 9 to get $\dfrac{9!}{9} = 8! = \boxed{40,\!320}$.
By the Binomial Theorem, the coefficient that we want is just $\binom{6}{2}=\boxed{15}$.
There are $4^3$ three letter words from A, B, C, and D, and there are $3^3$ three letter words from just B, C, and D
There must, then, be $4^3 - 3^3=64-27 = \boxed{37}$ words from A, B, C, and D containing at least one A.
By the binomial theorem, this term is $$\binom73x^3(2\sqrt3)^4=35x^3\cdot144=\boxed{5040}x^3.$$
The ways to arrange indistinguishable balls into indistinguishable boxes only depends on the number of balls in the boxes
The ways to do this are $(5,0,0)$, $(4,1,0)$, $(3,2,0)$, $(3,1,1)$, $(2,2,1)$
There are $\boxed{5}$ ways.
There are $\binom{7}{2}=21$ total ways for James to choose 2 apples from 7, but only $\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways for him to choose 2 green apples
So, the probability that he chooses 2 green apples is $\frac{3}{21}=\boxed{\frac{1}{7}}$.
Using the binomial theorem, we find that the $x^4=(x^2)^2$ term of the expansion is $\binom{5}{2}(1)^3(-2x^2)^2=10(4x^4)=40x^4$
Thus, the desired coefficient is $\boxed{40}$.
Because there are 6 choices of toppings, and each pizza must have 4 of them, there are ${6 \choose 4} = \boxed{15}$ four-topping pizzas.
There are 13 integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\binom{13}{2} = 78$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order
In order for the product of two integers to be odd, both of the integers themselves must be odd
There are 7 odd integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\binom72 = 21$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order
Therefore, the desired probability is $\dfrac{21}{78} = \boxed{\dfrac{7}{26}}$.
We are picking 3 boys out of 6, so there are $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ options for the boys on the team
We are picking 3 girls out of 8, so there are $\binom{8}{3} = 56$ options for the girls on the team
This gives a total of $20 \times 56 = \boxed{1120}$ choices.
The probability that the MegaBall matches is $\dfrac{1}{27}$
The probability that the 5 WinnerBalls match is $\dfrac{1}{\binom{44}{5}}$
So my chances of winning are $\left(\dfrac{1}{27}\right)\times\left(\dfrac{1}{\binom{44}{5}}\right) = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{29,\!322,\!216}}$.
For each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in
Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together
Hence there are $2^4 = \boxed{16}$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.
This problem requires a little bit of casework
There are four ways in which the dice can both show the same thing: if they both show maroon, both show teal, both show cyan or both show sparkly
The probability of getting maroon is $\dfrac{4}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show maroon is $\left(\dfrac{4}{20}\right)^2=\dfrac{16}{400}$
Similarly, the probability of getting teal is $\dfrac{7}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show teal is $\left(\dfrac{7}{20}\right)^2=\dfrac{49}{400}$, the probability of getting cyan is $\dfrac{8}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show cyan is $\left(\dfrac{8}{20}\right)^2=\dfrac{64}{400}$ and the probability of getting sparkly is $\dfrac{1}{20}$, so the probability that they will both get sparkly is $\left(\dfrac{1}{20}\right)^2=\dfrac{1}{400}$
So our answer is $\dfrac{16}{400}+\dfrac{49}{400}+\dfrac{64}{400}+\dfrac{1}{400}=\frac{130}{400}=\boxed{\dfrac{13}{40}}$.
There are $\binom{10}{3}=120$ ways to select exactly three dice to roll 1's ones out of ten dice total
The probability of any one of these outcomes occurring is $\left(\dfrac{1}{6}\right)^3\left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^7$ and they're all mutually exclusive cases, so the probability that one of them will occur (which is the probability that we're looking for) is $\binom{10}{3}\left(\dfrac{1}{6}\right)^3\left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^7=\dfrac{120\cdot5^7\cdot1^3}{6^{10}}\approx \boxed{.155}$.
The president can be any one of the 20 members, and the vice-president can be any one of the 10 members of the opposite sex
The answer is $20\times 10=\boxed{200}$.
Every positive integer appears in Pascal's triangle! The number 1000 appears in the row that starts 1, 1000
Then 1001 appears in the next row
So, the answer is $\boxed{1001}$.
Steve cannot get exactly half the questions right since there are an odd number of questions
So he can get either more than half or less than half correct, with equal probability, since he has a $1/2$ chance of getting any individual question correct
This means that Steve has a probability of $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$ of getting more than half correct, or identically, at least half correct.
There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails)
If the quarter is heads, there are 8 possibilities, since each of the other three coins may come up heads or tails
If the quarter is tails, then the nickel and dime must be heads, so there are 2 possibilities, since the penny can be heads or tails
So there are $8+2 = 10$ successful outcomes, and the probability of success is $\dfrac{10}{16} = \boxed{\dfrac{5}{8}}$.
There are two cases that we have to consider.
$\bullet~$ Case 1: The first card is one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10.
There are 32 such cards, so this occurs with probability $\dfrac{32}{52}$
For any of these cards, there are 4 cards left in the deck such that the cards sum to 12, so the probability of drawing one is $\dfrac{4}{51}$
Thus, the probability that this case occurs is $\dfrac{32}{52}\times\dfrac{4}{51} = \dfrac{32}{663}$.
$\bullet~$ Case 2: The first card is a 6.
There are 4 of these, so this occurs with probability $\dfrac{4}{52}$
Now we need to draw another 6
There are only 3 left in the deck, so the probability of drawing one is $\dfrac{3}{51}$
Thus, the probability that this case occurs is $\dfrac{4}{52}\times\dfrac{3}{51} = \dfrac{3}{663}$.
Therefore the overall probability is $\dfrac{32}{663} + \dfrac{3}{663} = \boxed{\frac{35}{663}}
To count the number of ways of arranging the 10 pieces of art with the three Escher's consecutively, treat the three of them as one item
It is clear that we are then selecting the location of 1 item out of 8 total which can be done in $\binom{8}{1}=8$ ways
There are also a total of $\binom{10}{3}=120$ ways to place the three pictures without restrictions
Thus the probability that we want is $\dfrac{8}{120}=\boxed{\dfrac{1}{15}}$.
The only way in which there won't be two dice of the same number is if for each number between 1 and 6 there is exactly one die displaying that number
If we line the dice up, there are a total of $6!$ ways in which we could order 6 dice all displaying different numbers and a total of $6^6$ possible outcomes since each of the 6 dice can have 6 outcomes and all of the rolls are determined independently
That means that the probability of all of the dice showing different numbers is $\dfrac{6!}{6^6}=\dfrac{5}{324}$, so the probability that we want is $1-\dfrac{5}{324}=\boxed{\dfrac{319}{324}}$.
In order for the four lines to enclose a rectangular region, we must choose two horizontal and two vertical lines
If we were to choose more than two of one of these types of lines, we would not be able to enclose any region
We can count independently the number of ways to choose vertical and horizontal lines
There will be $\dbinom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose horizontal lines, and the same number of ways to choose two vertical lines
Since these are independent, there are a total of $6\cdot 6=\boxed{36}$ ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle.
If Pascal's Triangle begins with row 1, then the sum of the elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}$
The interior numbers refer to all numbers in the row except the $1$ at each end, so the sum of the interior elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}-1-1=2^{n-1}-2$
For the fourth row, the sum is $2^3-2=6$
For the fifth row, the sum is $2^4-2=14$
So for the seventh row the sum is $2^{7-1}-2=64-2=\boxed{62}$.
The row 1, 1 has 2 numbers
The row 1, 2, 1 has 3 numbers
The row 1, 3, 3, 1 has 4 numbers
Each time we go down one row, we have one more number in the list
So, the row that starts 1, $k$ has $k+1$ numbers (namely, the numbers $\binom{k}{0}, \binom{k}{1}, \binom{k}{2}, \ldots, \binom{k}{k}$.)  So the row with 41 numbers starts $\binom{40}{0}, \binom{40}{1}, \binom{40}{2}, \ldots$
The 39th number has two numbers after it, and it is the same as the number in the row with only two numbers before it (that is, the 39th number is the same as the 3rd)
So, the 39th number is $\binom{40}{2} = \frac{40\cdot 39}{2\cdot 1} = \boxed{780}$.
There are 3 choices for the first move starting from $A$
Having made the first move, then there are 2 choices for the second move
Then there is just 1 choice for the third move
Thus, there are $3\times2\times1$ or $\boxed{6}$ paths from $A$ to $B$.
Since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we only need to consider the number of the balls in boxes without considering order
The arrangements are (4,0,0),(3,1,0),(2,2,0),(2,1,1), for a total of $\boxed{4}$ ways.
A multiple of 5 has to end in 0 or 5
If it ends in 0, the three remaining digits can go anywhere
There are 3! ways to arrange 3 digits, but we must divide by 2! to correct for overcounting since the 1's are identical
If the number ends in 5, the digit 0 can go in either of 2 places
Then the two remaining digits can go anywhere
There are 2! ways to arrange 2 digits, but we must divide this by 2! to correct for overcounting since the 1's are identical
So, there are $3!/2!+2\cdot 2!/2!=3+2=\boxed{5}$ possible ways to arrange the digits of 1150 to get a four-digit multiple of 5.
The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \choose 2}$ for some $n$
Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes
So, ${n \choose 2} + k = 281$
If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \choose 2} \le 281$, which implies $\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \le 0 $
So, the maximal $n$ is 24
So, $k = 281 - {24 \choose 2} = 281 - 12 \cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \boxed{5}$.
In order to produce a multiple of 63, we must choose at least two factors of 3 and one factor of 7 among the prime factorizations of the two numbers we choose
We count the number of ways in which we can do this by considering the four multiples of 7 in our list
There are two which are not multiples of 3 (7 and 35) and two that are multiples of 3 but not 9 (21 and 42)
Each of 7 and 35 can be paired with 27 to give a multiple of 63, so that's two successes
Each of 21 and 42 can be paired with any of 3, 27, or 51, which gives another $2\cdot 3 = 6$ successes
Finally, we can choose both 21 and 42, and we have a total of $2+6+1 = 9$ successes.
Since there are $\binom{7}{2}=21$ total ways to choose a pair of numbers from the list, the probability that a randomly chosen pair of numbers will have a product which is a multiple of 63 is $\frac{9}{21}=\boxed{\frac{3}{7}}$.
The program must contain exactly $3$ of the $5$ classes that are not English
Therefore, there are $\tbinom{5}{3} = 10$ valid programs if we ignore the mathematics requirement.
Since there are $2$ math classes (Algebra and Geometry), $3$ of the $5$ classes besides English are not math
Therefore, there is only one program that satisfies the English requirement, but does not satisfy the mathematics requirement (the program consisting of English, History, Art, and Latin)
It follows that the number of programs satisfying both requirements is $10-1=\boxed{9}.$
Ignoring who gets which pet for now, we can see that there are $15 \cdot 6 \cdot 8$ ways to choose one puppy, one kitten, and one hamster
Now, Alice has three choices for which type of pet she wants, Bob has two, and Charlie has one, due to the constraint that they must each have a different type of pet
Thus, there are $15 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = \boxed{4320}$ such ways.
For the first digit, there are seven choices (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9)
For the last digit, there are ten choices (0 through 9).
We know that if either of the middle digits is 0, their product will not exceed 5
So, only consider pairs of middle digits formed from choosing two numbers between 1 and 9, inclusive
There are $9 \cdot 9$ such pairs possible
The only pairs whose product will not exceed 5 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 31, 41, and 51
Thus, there are $9 \cdot 9 - 10 = 71$ ways in which we can choose the middle two digits.
Thus, there are $ 7 \cdot 71 \cdot 10 = \boxed{4970}$ such numbers.
If we expand this using the binomial theorem, we get a bunch of terms with $\sqrt3$ in them
To avoid painful estimation, we use the following trick: Add $(2-\sqrt3)^4$ to this expression
We know that $(2-\sqrt3)^4$ is small, since $2-\sqrt3<1$
When we add these together, the $\sqrt3$ terms magically cancel out
By the Binomial Theorem,  $$(2+\sqrt3)^4=2^4+4\cdot2^3\cdot(\sqrt3)+6\cdot2^2\cdot(\sqrt3)^2+4\cdot2\cdot(\sqrt3)^3+(\sqrt3)^4$$ whereas $$(2-\sqrt3)^4=2^4-4\cdot2^3\cdot(\sqrt3)+6\cdot2^2\cdot(\sqrt3)^2-4\cdot2\cdot(\sqrt3)^3+(\sqrt3)^4$$ Therefore, their sum is $$2(2^4+6\cdot2^2(\sqrt3)^2+(\sqrt3)^4)=2(16+72+9)=194$$ Since the term we added, $(2-\sqrt3)^4$, is less than a half (actually, it's less than .01), $\boxed{194}$ is the closest integer to $(2+\sqrt3)^4$.
There are $5!$ ways to arrange the books if they are unique, but two are identical so we must divide by $2!$ for an answer of $\dfrac{5!}{2!} = \boxed{60}$.
First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word
Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no vowels
We then subtract to get the answer.
Each letter of a word must be one of A, B, C, D, or E, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\times 5\times 5\times 5=625$
Each letter of a word with no vowel must be one of B, C, or D
So the number of all 4-letter words with no vowels in the word is $3\times 3\times 3\times 3=81$
Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel is $625-81=\boxed{544}$.
The number of ways to choose a committee of all boys or all girls is $2\times\binom{10}{4}=420$
The total number of committees is $\binom{20}{4}=4845$
Thus the answer is $1-\dfrac{420}{4845} = \dfrac{4425}{4845} = \boxed{\dfrac{295}{323}}$.
$$ \begin{array}{rcrcr} 7! &=& 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 &=& 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 \\ (5!)^2 &=& (5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1)^2 &=& 2^6 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \\ \text{gcd}(7!, (5!)^2) &=& 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 &=& \boxed{720} \end{array} $$
We find the probability that William misses the last four questions, and subtract from 1
The probability of William missing a question is $\frac{4}{5}$, so the probability that he misses all four is $\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4 = \frac{256}{625}$
The probability that he gets at least one right is $1-\frac{256}{625} =\boxed{\frac{369}{625}}$.
Since the boxes are indistinguishable, there are 3 possibilities for arrangements of the number of balls in each box.
Case 1: 5 balls in one box, 0 in the other box
We must choose 5 balls to go in one box, which can be done in $\binom{5}{5} = 1$ way.
Case 2: 4 balls in one box, 1 in the other box
We must choose 4 balls to go in one box, which can be done in  $\binom{5}{4} = 5$ ways.
Case 3: 3 balls in one box, 2 in the other box
We must choose 3 balls to go in one box, which can be done in $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways.
This gives us a total of $1 + 5 + 10 = \boxed{16}$ arrangements.
The only way for Joe not to eat at least two different kinds of fruit is if he eats all apples, all oranges, or all bananas
The probability that he eats all apples is $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) ^3=\frac{1}{27}$
The probability that he eats all oranges and the probability that he eats all bananas are the same
So, the probability that Joe eats at least two different kinds of fruit is $1-\frac{1}{27}-\frac{1}{27}-\frac{1}{27}=\boxed{\frac{8}{9}}$.
The total number of ways that the numbers can be chosen is $\binom{40}{4}.$ Exactly 10 of these possibilities result in the four cards having the same number.
Now we need to determine the number of ways that three cards can have a number $a$ and the other card have a number $b$, with $b\ne a$
There are $10\cdot 9 = 90$  ways to choose the distinct numbers $a$ and $b$
(Notice that the order in which we choose these two number matters, since we get 3 of $a$ and 1 of $b$.)
For each value of $a$ there are $\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose the three cards with $a$ and for each value of $b$ there are $\binom{4}{1}$ ways to choose the card with $b$
Hence the number of ways that three cards have some  number $a$ and the other card has some distinct number $b$ is $$90\cdot\binom{4}{3}\cdot\binom{4}{1}=90\cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 1440.$$ So the probabilities $p$ and $q$ are $\displaystyle \frac{10}{\binom{40}{4}}$ and $\displaystyle \frac{1440}{\binom{40}{4}}$, respectively, which implies that $$\frac{q}{p} = \frac{1440}{10} = \boxed{144}.$$
For each day, the expected amount of rain is $(.40)(0)+(.25)(4)+(.35)(10)=0+1+3.5=4.5$
To find the total expected amount of rain for the days from Monday to Friday, we can add the amounts for each day, getting $5\cdot4.5= \boxed{22.5}$ inches total.
First, put the house key and car key next to each other on the keychain
It doesn't matter where they are put, because the keychain can be rotated and reflected to move them to any other pair of adjacent locations
The remaining three keys can be put on the keychain in $3!=\boxed{6}$ ways.
This simplifies nicely because $5!$ divides both $6!$ and $7!$ evenly:
\begin{align*}
\frac{6! + 7!}{5!} &=\frac{6!}{5!} + \frac{7!}{5!}\\&= 6 + 6 \cdot 7\\
&= 6 \cdot 8 \\
&= \boxed{48}
\end{align*}
Note that $7^3 < 500 < 8^3,$ so any positive integer that can be written as the sum of two positive perfect cubes must be written as the sum of two cubes $a^3 + b^3$ where $1 \le a \le 7$ and $1 \le b \le 7.$ We can make a chart of the sum of two such cubes: $$
\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}
& 1^3 & 2^3 & 3^3 & 4^3 & 5^3 & 6^3 & 7^3 \\ \hline
1^3 & 2 & 9 & 28 & 65 & 126 & 217 & 344 \\
2^3 & & 16 & 35 & 72 & 133 & 224 & 351 \\
3^3 & & & 54 & 91 & 152 & 243 & 370 \\
4^3 & & & & 128 & 189 & 280 & 407 \\
5^3 & & & & & 250 & 341 & 468 \\
6^3 & & & & & & 432 & {559} \\
7^3 & & & & & & & {686}
\end{array}
$$ As we can see from the chart, there are $\boxed{26}$ such numbers less than $500.$
We will count the number of garment configurations in which the garments do not match color and divide by the total number of garment configurations in order to find the probability that the garments do not match
If the seventh-graders choose a black garment, there are two garments the eighth-graders can choose such that the garments don't match: white and gold
If the seventh-graders choose a gold garment, there are two garments the eighth-graders can choose to not match: black and white
Thus, there are $2+2=4$ garment configurations such that the garments don't match
The total number of garment configurations is $2\cdot3=6$ (one of two shorts and one of three jerseys), so the probability that the garments don't match is $4/6=\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
$\dbinom{8}{2} = \dfrac{8!}{2!6!}=\dfrac{8\times 7}{2\times 1}=\boxed{28}.$
There are three X's and two O's, and the tiles are selected without replacement, so the probability is \[
\frac{3}{5}\cdot\frac{2}{4}\cdot\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{1}= \frac{1}{10}.
The three tiles marked X are equally likely to lie in any of $\binom{5}{3}=10$ positions, so the probability of this arrangement is $\boxed{\frac{1}{10}}$.
In addition to two-digit numbers, consider the one-digit numbers $01$ through $09.$ Of these $99$ numbers, $9$ have repeated digits $01,$ $02,$ $03,$ $\ldots,$ $99,$ namely: $11,$ $22,$ $33,$ $\ldots,$ and $99.$ Of the remaining $90$ numbers, each one has a unique counterpart formed by swapping their tens and units digit
Thus among these, $45$ have a tens digit greater than the units digit
(The other $45$ have a tens digit smaller than the units digit.) The required answer is $\boxed{45}.$
If we draw a blue chip and then a yellow chip, or if we draw a yellow chip and then a blue chip, then our draws will be different colors
So, the probability is $\frac{5}{8} \cdot \frac{3}{8} + \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{5}{8} = 2 \cdot \frac{15}{64} = \boxed{\frac{15}{32}}$.
There are a total of $7$ fruits, so there are $7!$ ways to arrange them
However, since the fruits in each category are indistinguishable, we must divide out the repeats: $$\frac{7!}{3!2!2!}=7\times6\times5=\boxed{210}.$$
Let $A$ be the area of the circular dartboard
If the measure of a central angle of a sector is $x$ degrees, then the area of the sector is $\left(\frac{x}{360}\right)A$
The probability of the dart landing in a region is ratio of the area of the region to the area of the dartboard, so  \[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{\left(\frac{x}{360}\right)A}{A}.
\] Solve to find $x=\boxed{60}$.
We let the $x$ axis represent the time Allen arrives, and the $y$ axis represent the time Bethany arrives.
draw((0,0)--(60,0), Arrow);
draw((0,0)--(0,60), Arrow);
label("1:00", (0,0), SW);
label("1:15", (0,15), W);
label("1:45", (60,45), E);
label("1:15", (15,0), S);
label("2:00", (60,0), S);
label("2:00", (0,60), W);
fill((0,0)--(60,60)--(60,45)--(15,0)--cycle, gray(.7));
fill((0,0)--(60,60)--(45,60)--(0,15)--cycle, gray(.7));
[/asy]
The shaded region represents the times that Allen and Bethany would see each other at the party
For example, if Allen arrived at 1:30, Bethany could arrive at any time between 1:15 and 1:45 and see Allen at the party
Let one hour equal one unit
Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles
This will be equal to $2\cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{4}=\frac{9}{16}$
So, the area of the shaded region is $1-\frac{9}{16}=\boxed{\frac{7}{16}}$
Since the area of the square is 1, this is the probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party.
$\dbinom{7}{4} = \dfrac{7!}{4!3!}=\dfrac{7\times 6\times 5\times 4}{4\times 3\times 2\times 1}=\boxed{35}.$
First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $4!$
Then since the T's and the O's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ twice for the arrangements of T's and the arrangement of O's, for an answer of $\dfrac{4!}{2! \times 2!} = \boxed{6}$.
We start with the most restrictive conditions: the roles that are not open to both men and women
First, we will fill the two male roles
There are 5 men, so there are $5 \cdot 4= 20$ ways to assign 2 of the 5 men to the distinct male roles
Doing the same for the female roles, there are $6 \cdot 5 = 30$ ways
Finally, of the $5+6 - 2 - 2 = 7$ remaining actors, there are $7 \cdot 6 = 42$ ways to assign the leftovers to the either-gender roles
Multiplying, there are $20 \cdot 30 \cdot 42 = \boxed{25200}$ ways of assigning the six roles.
If 4 people get the right letter, then there is only one letter left, and only one person left
So, the last person will get the right letter, too
Therefore, it is impossible for exactly four people to get the right letter
So, the probability is $\boxed{0}$.
Constructing palindromes requires that we choose the thousands digit (which defines the units digit) and the hundreds digit (which defines the tens digit)
Since there are 9 choices for the thousands digit, and 10 choices for the hundreds digit, creating $9 \cdot 10 = \boxed{90}$ palindromes.
The row that starts 1, 12 is the row $\binom{12}{0}, \binom{12}{1}, \binom{12}{2},\binom{12}{3}$, so the fourth number in this row is $\binom{12}{3} = \frac{12\cdot 11\cdot 10}{3\cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \boxed{220}$.
We first have to figure out the different groups of 4 one-digit numbers whose product is 12
We obviously can't use 12 as one of the numbers, nor can we use 9, 8, or 7 (none divides 12)
We can use 6, in which case one of the other numbers is 2 and the other two are 1s
So, we can have the number 6211, or any number we can form by reordering these digits
There are $4!$ ways to order these four numbers, but we have to divide by $2!$ because the two 1s are the same, so $4!$ counts each possible number twice
That gives us $4!/2!=12$ numbers that consist of 6, 2, and two 1s.
Next, we note that we can't have a 5, so we think about 4
If we have a 4, then the other three numbers are 3, 1, 1
Just as there are 12 ways to order the digits in 6211, there are 12 ways to order the digits in 4311
Finally, we check if there are any ways to get a product of 12 with digits that are 3 or less
There's only one such group, the digits in 3221
As with 6211 and 4311, there are 12 distinct ways to order the digits in 3221.
Combining our three cases, we have $12+12+12=\boxed{36}$ possible integers.
There are a total of $\dbinom{25}{2}=300$ ways Michael could choose the 2 kids from his list
The only way Michael will not have enough from his interviews to write about both classes will be if he interviews two kids enrolled only in French or interviews two kids enrolled only in Spanish
In order to figure out the number of kids that satisfy this criteria, first note that $21+18-25=14$ kids are enrolled in both classes
Therefore, $18-14=4$ kids are only enrolled in French and $21-14=7$ kids are only enrolled in Spanish
If we drew this as a Venn diagram, it would look like: [asy]
draw(Circle((0,0),2.5),linewidth(1));
draw(Circle((3,0),2.5),linewidth(1));
label("14",(1.5,0));
label("4",(-.5,0));
label("7",(3.5,0));
label("French", (0,-2.5),S);
label("Spanish",(3,-2.5),S);
[/asy] Michael could choose two students enrolled only in the French class in $\dbinom{4}{2}=6$ ways
He could choose two students enrolled only in the Spanish class in $\dbinom{7}{2}=21$ ways
So, the probability that he will $\textit{not}$ be able to write about both classes is: $$\frac{\dbinom{4}{2}+\dbinom{7}{2}}{\dbinom{25}{2}}=\frac{6+21}{300}=\frac{9}{100}$$ Therefore, the probability Michael can write about both classes is: $$1-\frac{9}{100}=\boxed{\frac{91}{100}}$$
The president can be any one of the 20 members, and the vice-president can be any one of the 9 remaining members of the same sex
The answer is $20\times 9=\boxed{180}$.
We want to count the integers from the first one greater than $10.2^3$ to the last one less than $10.3^3$
We note that $(a+b)^3=a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3$ for any $a,b$
Using this expansion for $(10+.2)^3$ and $(10+.3)^3$, we have: \begin{align*}
(10+.2)^3&=10^3+300\cdot .2+30\cdot .04+.008\\
(10+.3)^3&=10^3+300\cdot .3+30\cdot .09+.027
\end{align*}We add up, and find the first to be $1061.208$ and the second to be $1092.727$
Thus, we want to count the integers between 1062 and 1092, inclusive; there are $\boxed{31}$ of these.
There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips
The number of ways to get 8, 9, or 10 heads is $\binom{10}{8}+\binom{10}{9}+\binom{10}{10}=45+10+1=56$
So the probability is $\dfrac{56}{1024}=\boxed{\dfrac{7}{128}}$.
For the first digit, we have 5 choices, then we have 4 choices left for the second digit, then 3 choices for the third digit, etc
So there are $5!=120$ arrangements of the digits
Notice that for each arrangement with 1 to the left of 2, we can reverse the arrangement so that 2 is to the left of 1
For instance, flipping 31245 results in 54213
So by symmetry, exactly half of the arrangements have 1 to the left of 2
In $\frac{120}{2}=\boxed{60}$ integers, the digit 1 is to the left of the digit 2.
By the fact that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, any arrangement of the digits will be a multiple of 3
To be a multiple of 5, the number must end in one of the fives, which will happen with probability $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$
Since any number that is a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5 is a multiple of 15, the probability of it being a multiple of 15 is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
Since $3!=6$, we need to divide 40320 by 6, which is $40320/6=\frac{36000+4200+120}{6}=6000+700+20=\boxed{6720}$.
There are a total of $6^5=7776$ possible sets of dice rolls
To get a pair without a three-of-a-kind, we can either have one pair and the other three dice all showing different numbers, or we have two pairs and the fifth die showing something different.
In the first case, there are $6$ ways to pick which number makes a pair and $\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to pick which $2$ of the $5$ dice show that number
Out of the other three dice, there are $5$ ways to pick a value for the first die so that that die doesn't match the pair, $4$ ways to pick a value for the second one so it doesn't match that die or the pair, and $3$ ways to pick a value for the last die so that it doesn't match any of the others
So there are $$6\cdot 10\cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 6^2 \cdot 100$$ways to roll this case.
In the second case, to form two pairs and one die not part of those pairs, there are $\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to pick which two numbers make the pairs, then $4$ ways to pick a value for the last die so that it doesn't match either of those pairs
There are $$\frac{5!}{2!\cdot 2!\cdot 1!}=30$$ways order the five dice (equal to the number of ways to order XXYYZ),  so that makes a total of $$15\cdot 4 \cdot 30 = 6^2\cdot 50$$ways to roll this case.
This makes a total of $$6^2 \cdot 100 + 6^2 \cdot 50 = 6^2 \cdot 150 = 6^3 \cdot 25$$ways to roll a pair without rolling a three-of-a-kind
So, the probability is $$\frac{\text{successful outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}}=\frac{6^3 \cdot 25}{6^5}=\frac{25}{6^2}=\boxed{\frac{25}{36}}.$$
The students' initials are AA, BB, CC, $\cdots$, ZZ, representing all 26 letters
The vowels are A, E, I, O, U, and Y, which are 6 letters out of the possible 26
So the probability of picking a student whose initials are vowels is $\frac{6}{26}=\boxed{\frac{3}{13}}$.
Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters
The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women  having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \boxed{26}$.
Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9
Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\cdot 19= 133$, $7\cdot 29 = 203$,
Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203,
., 903, 973
The last one is 910 more than the first
Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last
Therefore, there are $\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.
Since the order that we choose the captains in doesn't matter, we can choose 3 of them out of 11 players in $\binom{11}{3}=\boxed{165}$ ways.
A little casework seems like the simplest approach
First, if Paco spins a 1 or 2, it does not matter what Manu spins; the product is less than 30 regardless
If Paco spins a 3, the product will be 30 or greater only if Manu spins a 10, and both of these will be true with probability $\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{50}$
If Paco spins a 4, Manu's spins of 8, 9 or 10 will tip us over the 30 barrier, and this with probability $\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{10} = \frac{3}{50}$
If Paco spins a 5, Manu will break the 30 threshold with a 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10, probabilities being $\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{10}$
The total probability for these three cases is $\frac{1+3+5}{50} = \frac{9}{50}$
But, we want the probability that the product is less than 30, so we subtract our fraction from 1 and get $\boxed{\frac{41}{50}}$.
Case 1: The last two digits of our integer are equal
There are 10 possibilities for these last two digits and 4 choices for the hundred's digit, of a total of 40 possibilities
(Note that this case includes 111, 222, 333, and 444.)
Case 2: The first two digits are equal and the third is different
This occurs in $4\cdot 9 = 36$ ways, since we can choose the repeated digit in 4 ways and the remaining digit in 9.
Case 3:  The first and third digits are equal while the second is different
This also occurs in 36 ways.
Thus we have a total of $40 + 36 + 36 = \boxed{112}$ integers.
Another way to solve this problem is to find how many three-digit integers less than 500 have no digits that are the same
The first digit must be 1, 2, 3, or 4
The second digit can be any of the 9 digits not yet chosen, and the third digit can be any of the 8 digits not yet chosen, so there are a total of $4 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 288$ three-digit integers that have no digits that are the same and are less than 500
There are a total of $500 - 100 = 400$ three-digit integers that are less than 500, so we have a total of $400 - 288 = \boxed{112}$ integers that fit the problem

Since the three triangles $ABP$, $ACP$, and $BCP$ have equal bases, their areas are proportional to the lengths of their altitudes.
Let $O$ be the centroid of $\triangle ABC$, and draw medians $\overline{AOE}$ and $\overline{BOD}$
Any point above $\overline{BOD}$ will be farther from $\overline{AB}$ than from $\overline{BC},$ and any point above $\overline{AOE}$ will be farther from $\overline{AB}$  than from $\overline{AC}.$ Therefore the condition of the problem is met if and only if $P$ is inside quadrilateral $CDOE.$
pair A,B,C,D,I,F,O;
A=(0,0);
B=(10,0);
C=(5,8.7);
D=(2.5,4.3);
I=(7.5,4.3);
F=(5,0);
O=(5,2.3);
draw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));
draw(A--I,linewidth(0.7));
draw(B--D,linewidth(0.7));
draw(C--F,dashed);
label("$A$",A,W);
label("$B$",B,E);
label("$C$",C,N);
label("$D$",D,NW);
label("$E$",I,NE);
label("$F$",F,S);
label("$O$",O,SW);
[/asy]
If $\overline{CO}$ is extended to $F$ on $\overline{AB}$, then $\triangle ABC$ is divided into six congruent triangles, of which two comprise quadrilateral $CDOE$
Thus $CDOE$ has one-third the area of $\triangle ABC,$ so the required probability is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2
There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\frac{6}{21}=\frac{2}{7}$
Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\frac{2}{7}=\boxed{\frac{5}{7}}$.
There are 15 odd numbers, 15 even numbers, and 10 multiples of 3, making for $15^2\cdot 10 = 225 \cdot 10 = \boxed{2250}$ combinations total.
The largest number of pencils that any friend can have is four
There are 3 ways that this can happen: $(4,1,1)$, $(1,4,1)$ and $(1,1,4)$
There are 6 ways one person can have 3 pencils: $(3,2,1)$, $(3,1,2)$, $(2,3,1)$, $(2,1,3)$, $(1,2,3)$ and $(1,3,2)$
There is only one way all three can have two pencils each: $(2,2,2)$
The total number of possibilities is $3+6+1=\boxed{10}$.
We could solve this problem using casework, but using a little bit of symmetry and complementary probability gives us a more elegant solution
Since each coin flips heads and tails with equal probability, by the principle of symmetry the probability of getting more heads than tails is the equal to the probability of getting more tails than heads
Additionally, there are only three possible outcomes: getting more heads than tails, getting more tails than heads, or getting the same number of both
If we let $x$ represent the probability of the first outcome (which is the same as the probability of the second outcome) and $y$ represent the probability of the third outcome, we get the equation $2x + y = 1 \Rightarrow x=\dfrac{1-y}{2}$
So all we need to do is calculate the probability of getting the same number of heads and tails and we can then easily solve for what we want using the principle of complementary probability
Since there are two equally likely outcomes for each flip, there are a total of $2^8$ equally likely possible outcomes for flipping the 8 coins
We will have the same number of both heads and tails if we have exactly 4 of each, which we can count by selecting 4 out of the 8 flips to be heads which can occur in $\binom{8}{4}=70$ ways
So $y=\dfrac{70}{256}=\dfrac{35}{128}$, and substituting that back into our first equation gives us the probability that we want: $x=\boxed{\dfrac{93}{256}}$.
There is a $\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 20-sided die will show an even number and a $\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number
We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways
For each way, there is a $\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) ^4=\frac{1}{16}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers
Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $6\cdot \frac{1}{16}=\boxed{\frac{3}{8}}$.
In order to be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are normally 9 choices for the hundreds digit
But it also cannot be 7 or 9, so there are actually only 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and then 8 digits each for the units and tens digits
So, there are $7 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = \boxed{448}$ such numbers.
Counting the number of outcomes in which four 6-sided dice don't all show the same number would require some pretty delicate casework
However, counting all the outcomes in which four 6-sided dice do all show the same number is very easy: there are only 6 ways this can happen, namely all ones, all twos, all threes, all fours, all fives, and all sixes
So since there are $6^4$ total outcomes, we can conclude that $$ P(\text{4 dice all show the same number}) = \frac{6}{6^4} = \frac{1}{6^3} = \frac{1}{216}
$$Therefore, using the principle of complementary probabilities, we can conclude that $$ P(\text{4 dice don't all show the same number}) = 1 - \frac{1}{216} = \boxed{\frac{215}{216}}
The set $S$ contains $25$ multiples of 2 (that is, even numbers)
When these are removed, the set $S$ is left with only the odd integers from 1 to 49
At this point, there are $50-25=25$ integers in $S$
We still need to remove the multiples of 3 from $S$.
Since $S$ only contains odd integers after the multiples of 2 are removed,  we must remove the odd multiples of 3 between 1 and 49
These are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, of which there are 8
Therefore, the number of integers remaining in the set $S$ is $25 - 8 = \boxed{17}$.
There are a total of $\binom{50}{2}=1225$ ways to choose the two positive integers
Call these integers $a$ and $b$
The problem asks what the probability is that: $$ab+a+b=n-1$$where $n$ is a multiple of 5
We can add one to each side of this equation and factor: $$ab+a+b+1=(a+1)(b+1)=n$$Now, we need to count the number of values of $a$ and $b$ such that $(a+1)(b+1)$ is a multiple of 5
This will happen if at least one of the factors is a multiple of 5, which will mean $a$ or $b$ is one less than a multiple of 5.
There are 10 integers from 1 to 50 inclusive that are 1 less than a multiple of 5: $4,9,14, \dots, 49$
So, the number of ways to choose $a$ and $b$ so the product is $\textit{not}$ a multiple of 5 is $\binom{40}{2}=780$
Therefore, there are $1225-780=445$ ways to choose $a$ and $b$ that do satisfy the requirement, which gives a probability of: $$\frac{445}{1225}=\boxed{\frac{89}{245}}$$
There are two ways to arrange the shortest two leopards
For the five remaining leopards, there are $5!$ ways to arrange them.
Therefore, the answer is $2\times5!=\boxed{240\text{ ways.}}$
The expected value is $E = \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\times\$1\right) + \left(\dfrac{1}{3}\times\$3\right) + \left(\dfrac{1}{6}\times(-\$5)\right) = \$\dfrac{4}{6} =\boxed{\$\dfrac23 \approx \$0.67}$.
We let the $x$-axis represent the time Bob arrives, and the $y$-axis represent the time Alice arrives
Then we shade in the region where Alice arrives after Bob, and mark off the part of that area where Bob arrives before 1:30.
fill((0,0)--(60,60)--(0,60)--cycle, gray(.7));
draw((30,0)--(30,60));
label("1:30", (30,0), S);
draw((0,0)--(60,0)--(60,60)--(0,60));
draw((0,0)--(0,60));
label("1:00", (0,0), SW);
label("2:00", (60,0), S);
label("2:00", (0,60), W);
[/asy]
We need the ratio of the area of the shaded region to the left of the line marking 1:30 to the area of the whole shaded region
This ratio is $\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.
There are $3$ choices for the meat and $4$ for dessert.
There are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose $2$ of the $4$ vegetables, since we don't care about the order in which the vegetables are chosen.
The answer therefore is $3\cdot 4\cdot 6=\boxed{72}.$
We could do this with a bit of casework, but that gets boring after a while
Instead, we can use complementary probability
Since each child can be male or female with equal likelihood, there are $2^6=64$ possible ways in which the genders of the children can be determined
The only way in which Mr
Jones won't have more sons than daughters or more daughters than sons is if he has exactly 3 of each, which can occur in $\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways
Using the concept of complementary counting gives us that there are $64-20=44$ ways in which he can have more children of one gender than the other out of a total of 64 possible ways, for a final probability of $\dfrac{44}{64}=\boxed{\dfrac{11}{16}}$.
The probability that any single flip comes up heads is $1/2$
Since the flips are independent, the probability that the first two flips are both heads is $1/2\cdot1/2=\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
There are 8 Republicans and 3 spots for them, so there are $\binom{8}{3} = 56$ ways to choose the Republicans
There are 6 Democrats and 2 spots for them, so there are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose the Democrats
So there are $56 \times 15 = \boxed{840}$ ways to choose the subcommittee.
We will break this into three cases.
Case 1: numbers of the form $xyx$ ($x \ne 0$).
Any pair of nonzero digits has a corresponding palindrome ($xyx$) mountain number, so the number of these is $\binom{9}{2} = 36$.
Case 2: numbers of the form $xyz$ ($z \ne 0, x \ne z$).
Any group of three nonzero digits ($y > x > z > 0$) has two corresponding mountain numbers ($xyz$ and $zyx$), so the number of these is $2 \times \binom{9}{3} = 168$.
Case 3: numbers of the form $xy0$ ($x \ne 0, y \ne 0$).
Any pair of nonzero digits has a corresponding mountain number in the form $xy0$, so there are $\binom{9}{2} = 36$ of these.
So the total number of mountain numbers is $36 + 168 + 36 = \boxed{240}$.
First, we count the number of combinations that include pennies: we could have all pennies, all pennies and one nickel, all pennies and two nickels, all pennies and three nickels, all pennies and four nickels, all pennies and one dime, all pennies and two dimes, all pennies and one dime and one nickel, all pennies and one dime and two nickels
As for the no pennies case, we can have five nickels, one dime and three nickels, two dimes and one nickel
So, there are $9 + 3 = \boxed{12}$ combinations.
Since the balls are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of balls in the different boxes.
There are $3$ ways to arrange the balls as $(5,0,0)$ (specifically, box 1 can have 5, box 2 can have 5, box 3 can have 5).
There are $3! = 6$ to arrange $(4,1,0)$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $(3,2,0)$; in each case, we must choose one of the 3 boxes to have the largest number of balls, and also one of the remaining two boxes to be left empty.
However, there are only $3$ ways to arrange $(3,1,1)$, and $3$ ways to arrange $(2,2,1)$; in each case, we must choose one box to have the `different' number of balls (3 in the $(3,1,1)$ case and 1 in the $(2,2,1)$ case).
This gives a total of $3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \boxed{21}$ arrangements.
The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at
That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors
There are ${5 \choose 2} = \boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.
Because there are 4 teachers on the committee, there are 6 non-teachers
Now, in total, we can form ${10 \choose 4} = 210$ subcomittees
The number of subcomittees with 0 teachers is the number of subcommittees formed by the 6 nonteachers, totaling ${6 \choose 4} = 15$
So, the number of subcomittees with at least 1 teacher is $210 - 15 = \boxed{195}$.
We can think of the $3$ basic flavors as $3$ distinguishable boxes, and the $4$ scoops as $4$ indistinguishable balls
For every ball we put in the chocolate box, for instance, we put a scoop of chocolate ice cream in the blending machine
In this way we can correlate each new flavor with an arrangement of balls in boxes
So the number of different new flavors is the number of ways to put the balls into the boxes.
We can solve this as a "sticks and dots'' problem
Consider $4$ indistinguishable balls and $2$ indistinguishable sticks
Arrange them in a line
Fill the boxes by putting all the balls to left of the leftmost stick in the chocolate box, the balls between the two sticks in the vanilla box, and the balls to the right of the rightmost stick in the strawberry box
Each arrangement of sticks and balls corresponds to one way to fill the boxes, and each way to fill the boxes can be represented by these sticks and balls in a line
There are $\binom{6}{2}=\boxed{15}$ ways to pick $2$ spots out of $6$ to place the sticks, so that the balls take up the other $4$ spots, so this is the number of arrangements of sticks and balls, and so is the number of ways to fill the boxes, and so is the number of flavors.
After we choose the first vertex, there are 7 ways to choose the second
There are only 2 of these that are adjacent to the first vertex, so the probability the two vertices are adjacent is $\boxed{\frac{2}{7}}$.
First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word
Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants
We then subtract to get the answer.
Each letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\times 5\times 5\times 5=625$
Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$
So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\times 2\times 2\times 2=16$
Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=\boxed{609}$.
First we arrange the 2 groups of books; there are $2!$ ways in which we can do this
Then we can arrange the 3 math books in $3!$ ways and the 5 English books in $5!$ ways
Therefore, there are $2! \times 3! \times 5!=\boxed{1440}$ ways to arrange the books.
Although there are 12 entries on the table, there are only 6 different ``pairs'' of cities
Of the 6 pairs, 4 of them are less than 7,000 miles apart, yielding a $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$ probability that you select a pair less than 7,000 miles apart.
\begin{align*}
\dbinom{15}{3} &= \dfrac{15!}{12!3!} \\
&= \dfrac{15\times 14\times 13}{3\times 2\times 1} \\
&= \dfrac{15}{3} \times \dfrac{14}{2} \times \dfrac{13}{1} \\
&= 5\times 7\times 13 \\
&= \boxed{455}.
\end{align*}
This is counting the number of ways that six distinct objects can be put in order, so there are $6! = \boxed{720}$ different arrangements.
We count the number of ways to choose the vowels and the consonants separately
There are four vowels, of which two are As
If there are no As, then we must choose both the remaining vowels, so there is $1$ choice; if there is one A, then we can choose the remaining vowel in $2$ ways; and if there are two As, then there are no vowels left to choose, so there is $1$ choice
This makes $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$ distinct pairs of vowels.
There are seven consonants, of which two are Ts and of which two are Ms
Since we must choose four consonants, we must use at least one of the Ts and Ms.
If we use one T and no Ms, we have only $1$ choice (use the three remaining consonants); the same is true if we use one M and no Ts.
If we use both Ts and no Ms, there are $\tbinom{3}{2} = 3$ choices for the two remaining consonants; the same is true if we use both Ms and no Ts, or if we use one T and one M.
If we use both Ts and one M, there are $\tbinom{3}{1} = 3$ choices for the single remaining consonant; the same is true if we use both Ms and one T.
Finally, if we use both Ts and both Ms, there are no more letters left to choose, so we get $1$ more choice.
In total, we have $2(1) + 5(3) + 1 = 18$ distinct collections of consonants.
Therefore, the number of distinct collections of letters is $4 \cdot 18 = \boxed{72}.$
First, we consider how many total sets of three jellybeans we can select, which is very simply ${10 \choose 3} = 120$, if we treat all 10 jellybeans as distinct
Now, if we have exactly 2 red jellybeans, there are ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ pairs of red jellybeans, and $5+1 = 6$ choices for the third non-red jellybean
So, there are $6 \cdot 6 = 36$ successful outcomes
So our probability is $\frac{6 \cdot 6}{120} = \frac{6}{20} = \boxed{\frac{3}{10}}$.
There are $\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to choose which three of the four days it will be rainy so that the other day it will be sunny
For any of those 4 choices, there is a $\left( \frac{3}{4} \right) ^3 \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) ^1 = \frac{27}{256}$ chance for that choice to happen, because there is a $\frac{3}{4}$ chance that we get what we want when we want it to be rainy, and a $\frac{1}{4}$ chance that we get what we want when we want it to be sunny
The total probability is then $4 \cdot \frac{27}{256}= \boxed{\frac{27}{64}}$.
We can have all red, all white, or all blue
Thus the answer is  \begin{align*}
&P(\text{all red}) + P(\text{all white}) + P(\text{all blue}) \\
&\qquad = \left(\frac{4}{15}\times\frac{3}{14}\times\frac{2}{13}\right) +\left(\frac{5}{15}\times\frac{4}{14}\times\frac{3}{13}\right) \\
&\qquad\qquad+\left(\frac{6}{15}\times\frac{5}{14}\times\frac{4}{13}\right)=\boxed{\frac{34}{455}}
\end{align*}
Color the dots red and blue as shown below
Notice that whenever the ant moves, it moves from a red dot to a blue dot or a blue dot to a red dot
So since $A$ is a red dot, it must move to a blue dot, then a red dot, then a blue dot, then a red dot, and end up on a blue dot
There are only four blue dots, and the ant is equally likely to end up on any one of these four, since the diagram is symmetric to a $90^\circ$ rotation
The probability that the ant ends on $B$ after five minutes is therefore $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$
draw((-2,0)--(2,0));
draw((0,-2)--(0,2));
draw((1,1)--(1,-1)--(-1,-1)--(-1,1)--cycle);
dot((0,0),red); dot((1,0),blue); dot((2,0),red); dot((-1,0),blue); dot((-2,0),red); dot((0,1),blue); dot((0,2),red); dot((0,-1),blue); dot((0,-2),red); dot((1,1),red); dot((1,-1),red); dot((-1,-1),red); dot((-1,1),red);

The set of the three digits of such a number can be arranged to form an increasing arithmetic sequence
There are 8 possible sequences with a common difference of 1, since the first term can be any of the digits 0 through 7
There are 6 possible sequences with a common difference of 2, 4 with a common difference of 3, and 2 with a common difference of 4
Hence there are 20 possible arithmetic sequences
Each of the 4 sets that contain 0 can be arranged to form $2\cdot2!=4$ different numbers, and the 16 sets that do not contain 0 can be arranged to form $3!=6$ different numbers
Thus there are a total of $4\cdot4+16\cdot6=\boxed{112}$ numbers with the required properties.
\begin{align*}
\dbinom{25}{2} &= \dfrac{25!}{23!2!} \\
&= \dfrac{25\times 24}{2\times 1} \\
&= 25 \times \dfrac{24}{2} \\
&= 25 \times 12 \\
&= \boxed{300}.
\end{align*}
We know that there are a total of $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ three digit numbers
If we try to count how many have at least one 7 or one 9 as digits directly, we'll run into a load of casework
So instead, we proceed by counting the complement, the number of three digit numbers having no 7s or 9s as digits
We can choose the first digit in 7 ways (anything except 0, 7, 9) and the second and third digits in 8 ways each
This leads to a total of $7\cdot 8\cdot 8 = 448$ numbers that we don't want, leaving us with an answer of $900 - 448 = \boxed{452}$.
Each of the 4 games is independent of the others, and in each game, the Grunters have probability $\frac34$ of winning
Therefore, to get the probability that the Grunters will win all 4 games, we multiply the probabilities that the Grunters win each individual game
This gives:  \begin{align*}
&P(\text{Grunters win all 4 games}) \\
&\quad= P(\text{Grunters win Game 1}) \times \cdots \times P(\text{Grunters win Game 4}) \\
&\quad= \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} \\
&\quad= \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{\!4} = \boxed{\frac{81}{256}}.
\end{align*}
First we place the $0$, which we only have four options for (everywhere but the first digit)
Then we have 4 remaining places to put the last 4 digits, two of which are not unique (the fives), so there are $\dfrac{4!}{2!}$ options for arranging the other 4 digits
This gives a final answer of $\dfrac{4 \times 4!}{2!} = \boxed{48}$.
On each of the first three days, there is a $\frac{2}{3}$ chance that there will be no snow
On each of the next four days, there is a $\frac{3}{4}$ chance that there will be no snow
The chance that there will be no snow at all during the first week of January is $\left( \frac{2}{3} \right) ^3 \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) ^4=\frac{3}{32}$
Therefore, the probability that it snows at least once during the first week of January is $1-\frac{3}{32}=\boxed{\frac{29}{32}}$.
We can write
\begin{align*}
1061520150601 &= 1 \cdot 100^6 + 6 \cdot 100^5 + 15 \cdot 100^4\\
&\quad + 20 \cdot 100^3+ 15 \cdot 100^2 + 6 \cdot 100 + 1
\end{align*}Notice that the cofficients on powers of 100 are all binomial
In fact, we have
\begin{align*}
1061520150601 &= \binom66 \cdot 100^6 + \binom65 \cdot 100^5 + \binom64 \cdot 100^4 \\
&\quad+ \binom63 \cdot 100^3 + \binom62 \cdot 100^2 + \binom61 \cdot 100 + \binom60.\\
\end{align*}By the binomial theorem, this is equal to $(100 + 1)^6$, so its sixth root is $\boxed{101}$.
A constant term occurs when three of the terms in the product contribute $6x$ and other three contribute $\dfrac{1}{3x}$
Using the Binomial Theorem, we know that the constant term is $$\binom{6}{3}(6x)^3\left(\dfrac{1}{3x}\right)^3=(20)(2)^3=(20)(8)=\boxed{160}.$$
First we order the three groups of animals, which we can do in $3!$ ways
Next we order the animals within each group
There are $4!$ ways to arrange the group of chickens, $2!$ ways to arrange the group of dogs, and $5!$ ways to arrange the group of cats
The answer is $3!\times 4!\times 2!\times 5!=\boxed{34,\!560}$.
There are eight vertices of a cube, and we choose three of these to form a triangle
Thus, the number of distinct triangles that can be formed is $\binom{8}{3} = \frac{8\cdot7\cdot6}{3\cdot2} = \boxed{56}$.
We have two cases because if the first card is a King, it could be a $\heartsuit$ or not be a $\heartsuit$.
There is a $\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the King of $\heartsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{12}{51} = \dfrac{4}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the twelve remaining $\heartsuit$, which gives a probability of $\dfrac{1}{52} \times \dfrac{4}{17} = \dfrac{1}{221}$ chance that this occurs.
There is a $\dfrac{3}{52}$ chance that a non-$\heartsuit$ King is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{13}{51}$ chance that a $\heartsuit$ is drawn second, giving a $\dfrac{3}{52} \times \dfrac{13}{51} = \dfrac{1}{68}$ chance that this occurs.
So the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\dfrac{1}{221} + \dfrac{1}{68} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{52}}$.
It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes
We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \ldots, 5^{3}$
Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1^2 = 1^3 = 1$ and $2^{6} = 8^2 = 4^3 = 64$
So there is a total of $12+5-2=15$ integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes
Thus, we get $150-15=135$ integers from 1 to 150 that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes
So the probability that we select such a number is $\frac{135}{150} = \boxed{\frac{9}{10}}$.
Choosing a committee is a combination, since the order does not matter
We are choosing a 4-person committee from 25 people, so there are 25 ways to pick the first person, 24 ways to pick the second person, etc
However, we must divide by $4!$ since order doesn't matter
So the answer is $\dfrac{25 \times 24 \times 23 \times 22}{4!}=\boxed{12,\!650}$.
We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting
That is, if we had 4 distinct digits, there would be $4! = 24$ orderings
However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digit were different we would have twice as many orderings)
So, our answer is $\frac{4!}{2!\cdot 2!} = 2 \cdot 3 = \boxed{6}$.
We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction
If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block
There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block
We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\cdot2=12$ ways
The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways
Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\boxed{12}$ ways.
There is a $\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number
We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways
For each way, there is a $\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) ^5=\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers
Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\cdot \frac{1}{32}=\boxed{\frac{5}{16}}$.
The total number of outcomes is just the number of ways to choose 5 cards from a set of 52, which is $\binom{52}{5} = 2,\!598,\!960$
Notice that in this count, we don't care about the order in which the cards are chosen.
To count the number of successful outcomes, we turn to constructive counting, thinking about how we'd construct a full house.
To form a full house, we have to choose:
A rank for the 3 cards
This can be done in 13 ways.
3 of the 4 cards of that rank
This can be done in $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways.
A rank for the other 2 cards
This can be done in 12 ways (since we can't choose the rank that we chose in (a)).
2 of the 4 cards of that rank
This can be done in $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.
Again, note that in each of the steps in our constructive count, we don't care about the order in which the cards are chosen.
So there are $13 \times 4 \times 12 \times 6 = 3,\!744$ full houses
Thus, the probability is $$ \frac{3,\!744}{2,\!598,\!960} = \boxed{\frac{6}{4165}}
The only three digit numbers which are ruled out are numbers of the form $ABA$, where A and B are different digits
There are 9 ways to choose A, since it can't be 0, and once A has been chosen there are 9 ways to choose B
Since there are $9\cdot10\cdot10=900$ total three digit numbers, and $9\cdot9=81$ numbers which aren't valid, there are $900-81=\boxed{819}$ valid numbers.
$8! - 7! = 8 \times 7! - 7! = 7!(8 - 1) = 7! \times 7 = 5040 \times 7 = \boxed{35,\!280}$.
We proceed by casework.
Case I: 1 dot or dash
There are two possibilities: one dot, or one dash.
Case II: 2 dots or dashes
Each symbol can be a dot or a dash, so there are $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ sequences in this case.
Case III: 3 dots or dashes
Each symbol can be a dot or a dash, so there are $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$ sequences in this case.
Case IV: 4 dots or dashes
Each symbol can be a dot or a dash, so there are $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 16$ sequences in this case.
Thus, there are $2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = \boxed{30}$ distinct symbols that can be formed.
Because there are 6 choices of ice cream and each sundae must consist of 2 of them, there are ${6 \choose 2} = \boxed{15}$ kinds of two scoop sundaes.
There are $\binom{5}{4}=5$ ways to choose which 4 of the 5 days the plant will bottle chocolate milk
For each choice, there is a probability of $\left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^4 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1$ that on those 4 days they will be bottling chocolate milk and on the other day they will not
Therefore, the total probability on that exactly 4 of the 5 days they will be bottling chocolate milk is $5 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^4 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = \boxed{\frac{80}{243}}$.
Just counting the number of cousins staying in each room, there are the following possibilities: (4,0,0,0), (3,1,0,0), (2,2,0,0), (2,1,1,0), (1,1,1,1).
(4,0,0,0): There is only $1$ way to put all the cousins in the same room (since the rooms are identical).
(3,1,0,0): There are $4$ ways to choose which cousin will be in a different room than the others.
(2,2,0,0): Let us consider one of the cousins in one of the rooms
There are $3$ ways to choose which of the other cousins will also stay in that room, and then the other two are automatically in the other room.
(2,1,1,0): There are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which cousins stay the same room.
(1,1,1,1): There is one way for all the cousins to each stay in a different room.
The total number of possible arrangements is $1+4+3+6+1=\boxed{15}$.
First, we can find the denominator of our fraction
There are a total of $\dbinom{15}{3}=455$ ways to choose 3 articles of clothing out of 15
To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of clothing
There are 4 ways we can choose a shirt, 5 ways we can choose a pair of shorts, and 6 ways we can choose a pair of socks, making a total of $4\cdot 5 \cdot 6=120$ ways to choose a shirt, pants, and socks so our final probability is $\frac{120}{455}=\boxed{\frac{24}{91}}$.
To see which points in the rectangle satisfy $x>7y$, we rewrite the inequality as $y<\frac{1}{7}x$
This inequality is satisfied by the points below the line $y=\frac{1}{7}x$
Drawing a line with slope $\frac{1}{7}$ and $y$-intercept 0, we obtain the figure below
We are asked to find the ratio of the area of the shaded triangle to the area of the rectangle
The vertices of the triangle are $(0,0), (2009,0)$, and $(2009,2009/7)$, so the ratio of areas is  \[
\frac{\frac{1}{2}(2009)\left(\frac{2009}{7}\right)}{2009(2010)}=\frac{2009/14}{2010}=\boxed{\frac{287}{4020}}.

We consider the subset $\{ 1, 3, 5, 7 \}$ which consists only of the odd integers in the original set
Any subset consisting entirely of odd numbers must be a subset of this particular subset
And, there are $2^4 - 1 = \boxed{15}$ non-empty subsets of this 4-element set, which we can easily see by making the choice of including or not including each element.
If exactly one of the triplets is in the lineup, we have 3 choices for which triplet to put in the starting lineup, and then 11 people to choose from for the remaining 5 spots
So the answer is $3 \times \binom{11}{5} = 3 \times 462 = \boxed{1386}$.
Since $D$ and $C$ are located on segment $\overline{AB}$, if $AB=3AD$, then $\overline{AD}$ must take up $1/3$ of line segment $\overline{AB}$
Similarly, since $AB=6BC$, $\overline{BC}$ must take up $1/6$ of line segment $\overline{AB}$
Then, $\overline{CD}$ is the remaining segment of $\overline{AB}$ and takes up $1-1/3 - 1/6 = 1/2$ of the total length of $\overline{AB}$
Thus, if we were to choose a random point on segment $\overline{AB}$, there would be a $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that it is between points $C$ and $D$.
We draw the region and mark off the area where $x+y \le 4$:
draw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,6)--(0,6)--cycle);
fill((0,0)--(0,4)--(3,1)--(3,0)--cycle, gray(.7));
dot((0,0));
dot((3,0));

label("(0,4)", (0,4), W);
label("(3,1)", (3,1), E);
label("(3,0)", (3,0), E);
label("(3,6)", (3,6), E);
[/asy] The area of the rectangle is 18
The area of the shaded region, a trapezoid, is $\frac{1}{2}(1+4)\cdot3=\frac{15}{2}$
The probability that the point ends up in the shaded region is then $\boxed{\frac{5}{12}}$.
There is 1 way to make the first letter C and 3 ways to make one of the other letters B
We now have 4 ways to pick the letter for the first remaining spot and 3 ways to pick the letter for the last remaining spot
This is a total of $1\cdot3\cdot4\cdot3=\boxed{36}$ ways to arrange the letters.
There is a $\left( \frac{7}{10} \right) ^3 \left( \frac{3}{10} \right) ^3 = \frac{9261}{1000000}$ probability that 3 particular marbles out of 6 will be green and the rest will be purple
There are also  $\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose which 3 out of the 6 are the green ones
Because these ways are all mutually exclusive, we multiply to get the probability that we're looking for: $20 \cdot \frac{9261}{1000000}\approx \boxed{.185}$.
Order does not matter, so it is a combination
Choosing $3$ out of $8$ is $\binom{8}{3}=\boxed{56}.$
If exactly two of the triplets are in the lineup, we have 3 choices for which triplets to put in the starting lineup (we can see this by noting that we have 3 choices for which triplet to leave out), and then 11 people to choose from for the remaining 4 spots
So the answer is $3 \times \binom{11}{4} = 3 \times 330= \boxed{990}$.
We can rewrite the expression as $6!-(5\cdot5!+5!)$
Using the distributive property, we obtain $6!-(5+1)\cdot5!$
This is equal to $6!-6!=\boxed{0}$.
There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last
However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.
The answer is $\dfrac{12\times11\times10\times9}{4!}=\boxed{495}$ ways.
Since $N!=(N-1)!(N)$, we can rewrite the given fraction as $\frac{N!}{(N+1)!}$
We can rewrite the denominator as $(N+1)!=(N!)(N+1)$, so the fraction becomes $\frac{N!}{(N!)(N+1)}$
Canceling an $N!$ from the numerator and denominator, we are left with $\boxed{\frac{1}{N+1}}$.
$abc = 1$ only when $a=b=c= 1$
The probability that $a=1$ is $\frac16$
Therefore, the probability that $a,b,c$ are all 1 is $\left(\frac16\right)^3 = \boxed{\frac1{216}}$.
Cancel before multiplying: \begin{align*}
\frac{14!}{5!9!}&=\frac{14\cdot13\cdot12\cdot11\cdot10\cdot9!}{5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot9!} \\
&= \frac{14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10}{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} \\
&= \frac{14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11}{4 \cdot 3} \\
&= 14 \cdot 13 \cdot 11 \\
&= \boxed{2002}
\end{align*}
The ways to arrange identical darts on identical dartboards only depends on the number of darts on each board
The ways to do this are $(4,0,0,0)$, $(3,1,0,0)$, $(2,2,0,0)$, $(2,1,1,0)$, $(1,1,1,1)$
There are $\boxed{5}$ ways.
First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $6!$
Then since the T's, A's, and the R's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ thrice for the arrangements of T's, A's, and R's, for an answer of $\dfrac{6!}{2! \times 2! \times 2!} = \dfrac{720}{8} = \boxed{90}$.
There are 9000 four-digit positive integers
For those without a 2 or 3, the first digit could be one of the seven numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and each of the other digits could be one of the eight numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9
So there are \[
9000- 7\cdot 8\cdot 8\cdot 8=\boxed{5416}
\] four-digit numbers  with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.
We let $x$ denote the number of slips with a 2 written on them
(This is the usual tactic of letting a variable denote what we're trying to solve for in the problem.)  Then there are $12-x$ slips with a 7 on them
The probability of drawing a 2 is $\frac{x}{12}$ and the probability of drawing a 7 is $\frac{12-x}{12}$, so the expected value of the number drawn is $$ E = \frac{x}{12}(2) + \frac{12-x}{12}(7) = \frac{84-5x}{12}
$$But we are given that $E=3.25$, so we have the equation $$ 3.25 = \frac{84-5x}{12}
$$This simplifies to $39 = 84 - 5x$, which means that $x = 9$
Thus $\boxed{9}$ of the 12 slips have a 2 written on them.
We know that $\binom{19}{12}=\binom{18}{11}+\binom{18}{12}$ from Pascal's identity
Solving for $\binom{18}{12}$ and substituting the value that we have for $\binom{19}{12}$ gives us $\binom{18}{12}=50388-\binom{18}{11}$
Once again using Pascal's identity, we know that $\binom{18}{11}=\binom{17}{11}+\binom{17}{10}$
Substituting the values that we have for the terms on the right side gives us $\binom{18}{11}=31824$ and substituting that into our expression for $\binom{18}{12}$ gives us $\binom{18}{12}=50388-31824=\boxed{18564}$.
There are two cases: 5 people and 6 people stayed.
Case 1: 5 people stayed the whole time
The probability that exactly 2 of those that are unsure stayed the entire time is $\binom{3}{2}\times \frac{2}{5}\times\frac{2}{5}\times\frac{3}{5}= 36/125$.
Case 2: 6 people stayed the whole time
The probability that all three unsure people stayed is $(2/5)^3 = 8/125$.
The sum of these probabilities is $\boxed{\frac{44}{125}}$.
There are a total of $6^3=216$ possible sets of dice rolls
If at least one of the re-rolled dice matches the pair we set aside, we will have at least three dice showing the same value
But we will also have three dice showing the same value if all three re-rolled dice come up the same.
Consider the first case
There are five ways for each of the three dice NOT to match the pair, so there are $5^3=125$ ways for NONE of the three dice to match the pair, so there are $216-125=91$ ways for at least one of the three dice to match the pair.
In the second case, we need all three dice to match each other
There are $6$ ways to pick which value the three dice will have.
But we have overcounted by $1;$ both of the above cases include the outcome where all five dice match
So there are $91+6-1 = 96$ ways to have at least three dice match
So, the probability is $$\frac{\text{successful outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}}=\frac{96}{216}=\boxed{\frac{4}{9}}.$$
Because any permutation of the vertices of a large triangle can be obtained by rotation or reflection, the coloring of the large triangle is determined by which set of three colors is used for the corner triangles and the color that is used for the center triangle
If the three corner triangles are the same color, there are six possible sets of colors for them
If exactly two of the corner triangles are the same color, there are $6\cdot5=30$ possible sets of colors
If the three corner triangles are different colors, there are ${6\choose3}=20$ possible sets of colors
Therefore there are $6+30+20=56$ sets of colors for the corner triangles
Because there are six choices for the color of the center triangle, there are $6\cdot56=\boxed{336}$ distinguishable triangles.
After the first cube has been rolled, the other cube has six possible results
Three are one parity, and three are the other parity, so no matter what the first cube shows, there is a $\boxed{\frac12}$ chance that the sum is either parity
Note that this is true no matter how many such cubes are rolled.
The only way that the Senators can be seated is if the seats alternate by party
Fix the rotation by placing the youngest Democrat in the top seat, so that we have removed the overcounting of rotations of the same arrangement
Now there are $4!$ ways to place the remaining Democrats in the other Democratic seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in the Republican seats, for a total of $5! \times 4! = \boxed{2,\!880}$ arrangements.
Because non-overlapping regions that share a side cannot be the same color, the only way to color the grid is to have diagonal squares sharing the same color
So, Jessica can either color the top left and bottom right squares with color $1$ and the top right and bottom left squares with color $2$, or color the top left and bottom right squares with color $2$ and the top left and bottom right squares with color $1$
Thus, there are $\boxed{2}$ ways in which to color the grid.
Tim has 18 total socks, so there are $\binom{18}{2} = 153$ ways for him to pick 2 of them
There are $\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 10 gray-bottomed socks, and $\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 8 white-bottom socks, for a total of $45 + 28 = 73$ ways for him to pick a matching pair
So the probability he picks a matching pair is $\boxed{\frac{73}{153}}$.
We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting
That is, if we had 6 distinct digits, there would be $6! = 720$ orderings
However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, 2! for the repetition of the digit 5, and again 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digits were different then we could rearrange them in 2! ways)
So, our answer is $\frac{6!}{2!\cdot 2!\cdot 2!} = \boxed{90}$.
Once Max has chosen the first card, there are 51 cards remaining, of which 39 do not have the same suit as the first chosen card
Therefore, the probability that the two cards have different suits is $\dfrac{39}{51} = \boxed{\frac{13}{17}}$.
By Pascal's Identity, we have $\binom{8}{3} + \binom{8}{4} = \binom{9}{4}$
However, we also have $\binom{9}{4} = \binom{9}{9-4} = \binom{9}{5}$
There are no other values of $n$ such that $\binom{9}{4} = \binom{9}{n}$, so the largest possible value of $n$ is $\boxed{5}$.
First, the $2002$th positive even integer is $4004$, so we are looking for the number of digits used when the positive even integers less than or equal to $4004$ are written
Split this problem into cases
It's easy to see that there are four positive even integers with one digit: $2$, $4$, $6$, and $8$
Beginning with $10$ and ending with $98$, there are $\frac{98-10}{2} +1 = 45$ positive even numbers with two digits
Beginning with $100$ and ending with $998$, there are $\frac{998-100}{2} + 1 = 450$ positive even numbers with three digits
Finally, beginning with $1000$ and ending with $4004$, there are $\frac{4004-1000}{2} + 1 = 1503$ positive even numbers with four digits
So, our answer is $4 + 2\cdot 45 + 3 \cdot 450 + 4 \cdot 1503$, which equals $4 + 90 + 1350 + 6012$
Thus, there are $\boxed{7456}$ digits used.
The number of ways to draw out 3 balls from 15 is $\binom{15}{3}=455$
We can choose 2 black balls and 1 white ball in $\binom{8}{2}\binom{7}{1}=196$ ways
We can pick 1 black ball and 2 white balls in $\binom{8}{1}\binom{7}{2}=168$ ways
Therefore we have $196+168=364$ ways to satisfy the condition, so the answer is $\dfrac{364}{455}=\boxed{\frac{4}{5}}$.
Each letter in the word PROBLEM appears exactly once among the words CAMP, HERBS, and GLOW
Therefore, in order to have all of the letters to spell PROBLEM, Joe must select both M and P when choosing two letters from CAMP
The probability of this is $1/\binom{4}{2}=1/6$
Also, he must select the letters E, R, and B when choosing four letters from the word HERBS
Among the $\binom{5}{4}=5$ ways of choosing these letters, 2 of them contain all of the letters E, R, and B
Therefore, the probability that he will select E, R, and B from HERBS is 2/5
Finally, Joe must select L and O among the 3 letters he chooses from GLOW
Among the $\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways of choosing these letters, 2 of them contain both L and O
Therefore, the probability that he will select L and O from GLOW is $2/4=1/2$
Altogether, the probability that he will select all the letters from the word PROBLEM is $\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\boxed{\frac{1}{30}}$.
Since the balls are indistinguishable, we only have to consider the number of balls in the boxes
The arrangements for balls in boxes are $$(4,0,0),(3,1,0),(2,2,0),(2,1,1).$$However, since the boxes are distinguishable, we must also consider the arrangement of balls in the boxes in order.
For (4,0,0), there are $3$ different ways (box $\#1$ can have 4, box $\#2$ can have 4, or box $\#3$ can have 4).
For (3,1,0), there are $3! = 6$ ways: we have 3 choices for the box containing 3 balls, then 2 choices for the box containing 1 ball.
For (2,2,0) there are $3$ ways: we must choose the box which remains empty.
For (2,1,1) there are $3$ ways: we must choose the box which gets 2 balls.
This gives a total of $3 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \boxed{15}$ arrangements.
There are $5!$ ways to place the people around the table, but this counts each valid arrangement 5 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement)
The answer is $\dfrac{5!}{5} = 4! = \boxed{24}$.
We find the point which is equidistant from 0 and 4
Clearly, this occurs at 2
So, for all $x > 2$, $x$ is closer to 4 than 0
So, the probability is equal to the length of this region $\frac{5-2}{5} = \boxed{.6}$.
$\dbinom{11}{9} = \dfrac{11!}{9!2!}=\dfrac{11\times 10\times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3}{9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2\times 1}=\boxed{55}.$
Adding together the percent of people who drink coffee with those who drink tea, we obtain a total of $150\%$
Thus, we double-counted at least $50\%$, meaning that at least $\boxed{50\%}$ of adults drink both
(The percentage who drink both ${\it can}$ be exactly ${50\%}$ if everybody drinks either coffee or tea; otherwise, the overlap is more than ${50\%}$, but the problem asked for the smallest possible overlap.)
There are two O's, two I's, two N's and eleven total letters, so the answer is $\dfrac{11!}{2! \times 2! \times 2!} = \boxed{4,\!989,\!600}$.
There are $10!$ ways to put the shells in the sand, not considering rotations and reflections
Arrangements can be reflected or not reflected and can be rotated by 0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, or 4/5, so they come in groups of ten equivalent arrangements
Correcting for the symmetries, we find that there are $10!/10=\boxed{362880}$ distinct arrangements.
There are 3 options (boxes) for each of the 4 balls, so the number of ways is $3^4 = \boxed{81}$.
There are $0-3$ substitutions
The number of ways to sub any number of times must be multiplied by the previous number
This is defined recursively
The case for $0$ subs is $1$, and the ways to reorganize after $n$ subs is the product of the number of new subs ($12-n$) and the players that can be ejected ($11$)
The formula for $n$ subs is then $a_n=11(12-n)a_{n-1}$ with $a_0=1$.
Summing from $0$ to $3$ gives $1+11^2+11^{3}\cdot 10+11^{4}\cdot 10\cdot 9$
Notice that $10+9\cdot11\cdot10=10+990=1000$
Then, rearrange it into $1+11^2+11^3\cdot (10+11\cdot10\cdot9)= 1+11^2+11^3\cdot (1000)$
When taking modulo $1000$, the last term goes away
What is left is $1+11^2=\boxed{122}$.
Notice that, other than the number 5, the remaining numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 are only divisible by 2 and/or 3
We can do some cases on the number of 5's rolled (note that there are $6^4 = 1296$ outcomes).
Case 1 (easy): Four 5's are rolled
This has probability $\frac{1}{6^4}$ of occurring.
Case 2: Two 5's are rolled.
Case 3: No 5's are rolled.
To find the number of outcomes for the latter two cases, we will use recursion
Consider a 5-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
For $n \ge 1$, let $a_n$ equal the number of outcomes after rolling the die $n$ times, with the property that the product is a square
Thus, $a_1 = 2$ as 1 and 4 are the only possibilities.
To find $a_{n+1}$ given $a_n$ (where $n \ge 1$), we observe that if the first $n$ rolls multiply to a perfect square, then the last roll must be 1 or 4
This gives $2a_n$ outcomes
Otherwise, the first $n$ rolls do not multiply to a perfect square ($5^n - a_n$ outcomes)
In this case, we claim that the last roll is uniquely determined (either 2, 3, or 6)
If the product of the first $n$ rolls is $2^x 3^y$ where $x$ and $y$ are not both even, then we observe that if $x$ and $y$ are both odd, then the last roll must be 6; if only $x$ is odd, the last roll must be 2, and if only $y$ is odd, the last roll must be 3
Thus, we have $5^n - a_n$ outcomes in this case, and $a_{n+1} = 2a_n + (5^n - a_n) = 5^n + a_n$.
Computing $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$ gives $a_2 = 7$, $a_3 = 32$, and $a_4 = 157$
Thus for Case 3, there are 157 outcomes
For case 2, we multiply by $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ to distribute the two 5's among four rolls
Thus the probability is
\[\frac{1 + 6 \cdot 7 + 157}{6^4} = \frac{200}{6^4} = \frac{25}{162} \implies m+n = \boxed{187}.\]
Realize that any sequence that works (ascending) can be reversed for descending, so we can just take the amount of sequences that satisfy the ascending condition and multiply by two.
If we choose any of the numbers $1$ through $6$, there are five other spots to put them, so we get $6 \cdot 5 = 30$
However, we overcount some cases
Take the example of $132456$
We overcount this case because we can remove the $3$ or the $2$
Therefore, any cases with two adjacent numbers swapped is overcounted, so we subtract $5$ cases (namely, $213456, 132456, 124356, 123546, 123465$,) to get $30-5=25$, but we have to add back one more for the original case, $123456$
Therefore, there are $26$ cases
Multiplying by $2$ gives the desired answer, $\boxed{52}$.
[asy] size(12cm); for (int x = 1; x < 18; ++x) {     draw((x, 0) -- (x, 9), dotted); } for (int y = 1; y < 9; ++y) {     draw((0, y) -- (18, y), dotted); }  draw((0, 0) -- (18, 0) -- (18, 9) -- (0, 9) -- cycle);  pair b1, b2, b3; pair c1, c2, c3; pair a1, a2, a3; b1 = (3, 0); b2 = (12, 0); b3 = (16, 0); c1 = (0, 2); c2 = (0, 4); c3 = (0, 8); a1 = b1 + c1; a2 = b2 + c2; a3 = b3 + c3;  draw(b1 -- a1 -- c1); draw(b2 -- a2 -- c2); draw(b3 -- a3 -- c3);  dot(a1); dot(a2); dot(a3); label("$a_1$", a1, NE); label("$a_2$", a2, NE); label("$a_3$", a3, NE); label("$b_1$", b1, S); label("$b_2$", b2, S); label("$b_3$", b3, S); label("$c_1$", c1, W); label("$c_2$", c2, W); label("$c_3$", c3, W);  [/asy]
First, prime factorize $20^9$ as $2^{18} \cdot 5^9$
Denote $a_1$ as $2^{b_1} \cdot 5^{c_1}$, $a_2$ as $2^{b_2} \cdot 5^{c_2}$, and $a_3$ as $2^{b_3} \cdot 5^{c_3}$.
In order for $a_1$ to divide $a_2$, and for $a_2$ to divide $a_3$, $b_1\le b_2\le b_3$, and $c_1\le c_2\le c_3$
We will consider each case separately
Note that the total amount of possibilities is $190^3$, as there are $(18+1)(9+1)=190$ choices for each factor.
We notice that if we add $1$ to $b_2$ and $2$ to $b_3$, then we can reach the stronger inequality $0\le b_1<b_2+1<b_3+2\le 20$
Therefore, if we pick $3$ integers from $0$ to $20$, they will correspond to a unique solution, forming a 1-1 correspondence between the numbers $b_1$, $b_2+1$, and $b_3+2$
This is also equivalent to applying stars and bars on distributing the powers of 2 and 5 through differences
The amount of solutions to this inequality is $\dbinom{21}{3}$.
The case for $c_1$,$c_2$, and $c_3$ proceeds similarly for a result of $\dbinom{12}{3}$
Therefore, the probability of choosing three such factors is\[\frac{\dbinom{21}{3} \cdot \dbinom{12}{3}}{190^3}.\]Simplification gives $\frac{77}{1805}$, and therefore the answer is $\boxed{77}$.
Suppose that the two identical digits are both $1$
Since the thousands digit must be $1$, only one of the other three digits can be $1$
This means the possible forms for the number are
$11xy,\qquad 1x1y,\qquad1xy1$
Because the number must have exactly two identical digits, $x\neq y$, $x\neq1$, and $y\neq1$
Hence, there are $3\cdot9\cdot8=216$ numbers of this form.
Now suppose that the two identical digits are not $1$
Reasoning similarly to before, we have the following possibilities:
$1xxy,\qquad1xyx,\qquad1yxx.$
Again, $x\neq y$, $x\neq 1$, and $y\neq 1$
There are $3\cdot9\cdot8=216$ numbers of this form.
Thus the answer is $216+216=\boxed{432}$.
Let $S$ be a non- empty subset of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.
Then the alternating sum of $S$, plus the alternating sum of $S \cup \{7\}$, is $7$
This is because, since $7$ is the largest element, when we take an alternating sum, each number in $S$ ends up with the opposite sign of each corresponding element of $S\cup \{7\}$.
Because there are $2^{6}=64$ of these pairs of sets, the sum of all possible subsets of our given set is $64 \cdot 7$, giving an answer of $\boxed{448}$.
We can use complementary counting, by finding the probability that none of the three knights are sitting next to each other and subtracting it from $1$.
Imagine that the $22$ other (indistinguishable) people are already seated, and fixed into place.
We will place $A$, $B$, and $C$ with and without the restriction.
There are $22$ places to put $A$, followed by $21$ places to put $B$, and $20$ places to put $C$ after $A$ and $B$
Hence, there are $22\cdot21\cdot20$ ways to place $A, B, C$ in between these people with restrictions.
Without restrictions, there are $22$ places to put $A$, followed by $23$ places to put $B$, and $24$ places to put $C$ after $A$ and $B$
Hence, there are $22\cdot23\cdot24$ ways to place $A,B,C$ in between these people without restrictions.
Thus, the desired probability is $1-\frac{22\cdot21\cdot20}{22\cdot23\cdot24}=1-\frac{420}{552}=1-\frac{35}{46}=\frac{11}{46}$, and the answer is $11+46=\boxed{57}$.
Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \choose 100}=\frac{200!}{100!100!}$
Let the required prime be $p$; then $10 \le p < 100$
If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator
Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor at least three times in the numerator, so $3p<200$
The largest such prime is $\boxed{61}$, which is our answer.
First notice that there is no difference between the maple trees and the oak trees; we have only two types, birch trees and "non-birch" trees
(If you don't believe this reasoning, think about it
You could also differentiate the tall oak trees from the short oak trees, and the maple trees with many branches as opposed to those with few branches
Indeed, you could keep dividing until you have them each in their own category, but in the end it will not change the probability of the birch trees being near each other
That is, in the end, you multiply the numerator by the number of ways to arrange the oak and maple trees and you also multiply the denominator by the number of ways to arrange the oak and maple trees, making them cancel out.)
The five birch trees must be placed amongst the seven previous trees
We can think of these trees as 5 dividers of 8 slots that the birch trees can go in, making ${8\choose5} = 56$ different ways to arrange this.
There are ${12 \choose 5} = 792$ total ways to arrange the twelve trees, so the probability is $\frac{56}{792} = \frac{7}{99}$.
The answer is $7 + 99 = \boxed{106}$.
Let $P(n)$ denote the probability that the bug is at $A$ after it has crawled $n$ meters
Since the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex which is not $A$, we have $P(n + 1) = \frac13 (1 - P(n))$
We also know $P(0) = 1$, so we can quickly compute $P(1)=0$, $P(2) = \frac 13$, $P(3) = \frac29$, $P(4) = \frac7{27}$, $P(5) = \frac{20}{81}$, $P(6) = \frac{61}{243}$ and $P(7) = \frac{182}{729}$, so the answer is $\boxed{182}$
One can solve this recursion fairly easily to determine a closed-form expression for $P(n)$.
Because the octahedron is symmetric and all vertices have the same number of edges, we can assume that the first vertex we choose is the top one
If we do not choose this vertex, we can simply rotate the octahedron so that we have
From here, there are 5 other vertices
4 of them share an edge with the vertex we have already chosen, so the probability that the 2 vertices chosen form an edge is $\boxed{\frac{4}{5}}$.
Let us suppose for convenience that there were $n + 10$ players overall
Among the $n$ players not in the weakest 10 there were $n \choose 2$ games played and thus $n \choose 2$ points earned
By the givens, this means that these $n$ players also earned $n \choose 2$ points against our weakest 10
Now, the 10 weakest players playing amongst themselves played ${10 \choose 2} = 45$ games and so earned 45 points playing each other
Then they also earned 45 points playing against the stronger $n$ players
Since every point earned falls into one of these categories, It follows that the total number of points earned was $2{n \choose 2} + 90 = n^2 - n + 90$
However, there was one point earned per game, and there were a total of ${n + 10 \choose 2} = \frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ games played and thus $\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ points earned
So we have $n^2 -n + 90 = \frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ so $2n^2 - 2n + 180 = n^2 + 19n + 90$ and $n^2 -21n + 90 = 0$ and $n = 6$ or $n = 15$
Now, note that the top $n$ players got $n(n - 1)$ points in total (by our previous calculation) for an average of $n - 1$, while the bottom 10 got 90 points total, for an average of 9
Thus we must have $n > 10$, so $n = 15$ and the answer is $15 + 10 = \boxed{25}$.
Let's consider each of the sequences of two coin tosses as an operation instead; this operation takes a string and adds the next coin toss on (eg, THHTH + HT = THHTHT)
We examine what happens to the last coin toss
Adding HH or TT is simply an identity for the last coin toss, so we will ignore them for now
However, adding HT or TH switches the last coin
H switches to T three times, but T switches to H four times; hence it follows that our string will have a structure of THTHTHTH.
Now we have to count all of the different ways we can add the identities back in
There are 5 TT subsequences, which means that we have to add 5 T into the strings, as long as the new Ts are adjacent to existing Ts
There are already 4 Ts in the sequence, and since order doesn’t matter between different tail flips this just becomes the ball-and-urn argument
We want to add 5 balls into 4 urns, which is the same as 3 dividers; hence this gives ${{5+3}\choose3} = 56$ combinations
We do the same with 2 Hs to get ${{2+3}\choose3} = 10$ combinations; thus there are $56 \cdot 10 = \boxed{560}$ possible sequences.
If any of $r_1, \ldots, r_{19}$ is larger than $r_{20}$, one of these numbers will be compared with $r_{20}$ on the 19th step of the first bubble pass and $r_{20}$ will be moved back to the 19th position
Thus, $r_{20}$ must be the largest of the first 20 terms
In addition, $r_{20}$ must be larger than $r_{21}, r_{22}, \ldots, r_{30}$ but smaller than $r_{31}$ in order that it move right to the 30th position but then not continue moving right to the 31st.
Thus, our problem can be restated: What is the probability that in a sequence of 31 distinct real numbers, the largest is in position 31 and the second-largest is in position 20 (the other 29 numbers are irrelevant)?
This is much easier to solve: there are $31!$ ways to order the first thirty-one numbers and $29!$ ways to arrange them so that the largest number is in the 31st position and the second-largest is in the 20th
This gives us a desired probability of $\frac{29!}{31!} = \frac{1}{31\cdot 30} = \frac{1}{930}$, so the answer is $\boxed{931}$.
Since $8$ had already been added to the pile, the numbers $1 \ldots 7$ had already been added at some time to the pile; $9$ might or might not have been added yet
So currently $S$ is a subset of $\{1, 2, \ldots 7\}$, possibly with $9$ at the end
Given that $S$ has $k$ elements, there are $k+1$ intervals for $9$ to be inserted, or $9$ might have already been placed, giving $k+2$ different possibilities.
Thus, the answer is $\sum_{k=0}^{7} {7 \choose k}(k+2)$ $= 1 \cdot 2 + 7 \cdot 3 + 21 \cdot 4 + 35 \cdot 5 + 35 \cdot 6 + 21 \cdot 7 + 7 \cdot 8 + 1 \cdot 9$ $= \boxed{704}$.
We first show that we can choose at most 5 numbers from $\{1, 2, \ldots , 11\}$ such that no two numbers have a difference of $4$ or $7$
We take the smallest number to be $1$, which rules out $5,8$
Now we can take at most one from each of the pairs: $[2,9]$, $[3,7]$, $[4,11]$, $[6,10]$
Now, $1989 = 180\cdot 11 + 9$
Because this isn't an exact multiple of $11$, we need to consider some numbers separately.
Notice that $1969 = 180\cdot11 - 11 = 179\cdot11$
Therefore we can put the last $1969$ numbers into groups of 11
Now let's examine $\{1, 2, \ldots , 20\}$
If we pick $1, 3, 4, 6, 9$ from the first $11$ numbers, then we're allowed to pick $11 + 1$, $11 + 3$, $11 + 4$, $11 + 6$, $11 + 9$
This means we get 10 members from the 20 numbers
Our answer is thus $179\cdot 5 + 10 = \boxed{905}$.
Any subset of the ten points with three or more members can be made into exactly one such polygon
Thus, we need to count the number of such subsets
There are $2^{10} = 1024$ total subsets of a ten-member set, but of these ${10 \choose 0} = 1$ have 0 members, ${10 \choose 1} = 10$ have 1 member and ${10 \choose 2} = 45$ have 2 members
Thus the answer is $1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 = \boxed{968}$.
Denote the probability of getting a heads in one flip of the biased coin as $h$
Based upon the problem, note that ${5\choose1}(h)^1(1-h)^4 = {5\choose2}(h)^2(1-h)^3$
After canceling out terms, we get $1 - h = 2h$, so $h = \frac{1}{3}$
The answer we are looking for is ${5\choose3}(h)^3(1-h)^2 = 10\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{40}{243}$, so $i+j=40+243=\boxed{283}$.
Suppose that the columns are labeled $A$, $B$, and $C$
Consider the string $AAABBBCC$
Since the arrangements of the strings is bijective to the order of shooting, the answer is the number of ways to arrange the letters which is $\frac{8!}{3! \cdot 3! \cdot 2!} = \boxed{560}$.
Let $r$ and $b$ denote the number of red and blue socks, respectively
Also, let $t=r+b$
The probability $P$ that when two socks are drawn randomly, without replacement, both are red or both are blue is given by
\[\frac{r(r-1)}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}+\frac{b(b-1)}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}=\frac{r(r-1)+(t-r)(t-r-1)}{t(t-1)}=\frac{1}{2}.\]
Solving the resulting quadratic equation $r^{2}-rt+t(t-1)/4=0$, for $r$ in terms of $t$, one obtains that
\[r=\frac{t\pm\sqrt{t}}{2}\, .\]
Now, since $r$ and $t$ are positive integers, it must be the case that $t=n^{2}$, with $n\in\mathbb{N}$
Hence, $r=n(n\pm 1)/2$ would correspond to the general solution
For the present case $t\leq 1991$, and so one easily finds that $n=44$ is the largest possible integer satisfying the problem conditions.
In summary, the solution is that the maximum number of red socks is $r=\boxed{990}$.
We first think of the Cubs forming a single block, denoted C, the Red Sox forming a single block R, and the Yankees forming a single block Y
Then there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the three blocks in a row: $$ \text{\textbf{\large CRY, CYR, RCY, RYC, YRC, YCR}.} $$Within each block, there are $3!$ ways to arrange the Cubs, $3!$ ways to arrange the Red Sox, and $2!$ ways to arrange the Yankees
Therefore, there are $$ 3! \times 3! \times 3! \times 2! = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 2 = \boxed{432} $$ways to seat all eight All-Stars.
Of the $70$ fish caught in September, $40\%$ were not there in May, so $42$ fish were there in May
Since the percentage of tagged fish in September is proportional to the percentage of tagged fish in May, $\frac{3}{42} = \frac{60}{x} \Longrightarrow \boxed{840}$.
The thousands digit is $\in \{4,5,6\}$.
Case $1$: Thousands digit is even
$4, 6$, two possibilities, then there are only $\frac{10}{2} - 1 = 4$ possibilities for the units digit
This leaves $8$ possible digits for the hundreds and $7$ for the tens places, yielding a total of $2 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 4 = 448$.
Case $2$: Thousands digit is odd
$5$, one possibility, then there are $5$ choices for the units digit, with $8$ digits for the hundreds and $7$ for the tens place
This gives $1 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 5= 280$ possibilities.
Together, the solution is $448 + 280 = \boxed{728}$.
Call the six numbers selected $x_1 > x_2 > x_3 > x_4 > x_5 > x_6$
Clearly, $x_1$ must be a dimension of the box, and $x_6$ must be a dimension of the brick.
If $x_2$ is a dimension of the box, then any of the other three remaining dimensions will work as a dimension of the box
That gives us $3$ possibilities.
If $x_2$ is not a dimension of the box but $x_3$ is, then both remaining dimensions will work as a dimension of the box
That gives us $2$ possibilities.
If $x_4$ is a dimension of the box but $x_2,\ x_3$ aren’t, there are no possibilities (same for $x_5$).
The total number of arrangements is ${6\choose3} = 20$; therefore, $p = \frac{3 + 2}{20} = \frac{1}{4}$, and the answer is $1 + 4 = \boxed{5}$.
We have the smallest stack, which has a height of $94 \times 4$ inches
Now when we change the height of one of the bricks, we either add $0$ inches, $6$ inches, or $15$ inches to the height
Now all we need to do is to find the different change values we can get from $94$ $0$'s, $6$'s, and $15$'s
Because $0$, $6$, and $15$ are all multiples of $3$, the change will always be a multiple of $3$, so we just need to find the number of changes we can get from $0$'s, $2$'s, and $5$'s.
From here, we count what we can get:
\[0, 2 = 2, 4 = 2+2, 5 = 5, 6 = 2+2+2, 7 = 5+2, 8 = 2+2+2+2, 9 = 5+2+2, \ldots\]
It seems we can get every integer greater or equal to four; we can easily deduce this by considering parity or using the Chicken McNugget Theorem, which says that the greatest number that cannot be expressed in the form of $2m + 5n$ for $m,n$ being positive integers is $5 \times 2 - 5 - 2=3$.
But we also have a maximum change ($94 \times 5$), so that will have to stop somewhere
To find the gaps, we can work backwards as well
From the maximum change, we can subtract either $0$'s, $3$'s, or $5$'s
The maximum we can't get is $5 \times 3-5-3=7$, so the numbers $94 \times 5-8$ and below, except $3$ and $1$, work
Now there might be ones that we haven't counted yet, so we check all numbers between $94 \times 5-8$ and $94 \times 5$
$94 \times 5-7$ obviously doesn't work, $94 \times 5-6$ does since 6 is a multiple of 3, $94 \times 5-5$ does because it is a multiple of $5$ (and $3$), $94 \times 5-4$ doesn't since $4$ is not divisible by $5$ or $3$, $94 \times 5-3$ does since $3=3$, and $94 \times 5-2$ and $94 \times 5-1$ don't, and $94 \times 5$ does.
Thus the numbers $0$, $2$, $4$ all the way to $94 \times 5-8$, $94 \times 5-6$, $94 \times 5-5$, $94 \times 5-3$, and $94\times 5$ work
That's $2+(94 \times 5 - 8 - 4 +1)+4=\boxed{465}$ numbers.
Think of the problem as a sequence of H's and T's
No two T's can occur in a row, so the sequence is blocks of $1$ to $4$ H's separated by T's and ending in $5$ H's
Since the first letter could be T or the sequence could start with a block of H's, the total probability is that $3/2$ of it has to start with an H.
The answer to the problem is then the sum of all numbers of the form $\frac 32 \left( \frac 1{2^a} \cdot \frac 12 \cdot \frac 1{2^b} \cdot \frac 12 \cdot \frac 1{2^c} \cdots \right) \cdot \left(\frac 12\right)^5$, where $a,b,c \ldots$ are all numbers $1-4$, since the blocks of H's can range from $1-4$ in length
The sum of all numbers of the form $(1/2)^a$ is $1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16=15/16$, so if there are n blocks of H's before the final five H's, the answer can be rewritten as the sum of all numbers of the form $\frac 32\left( \left(\frac {15}{16}\right)^n \cdot \left(\frac 12\right)^n \right) \cdot \left(\frac 1{32}\right)=\frac 3{64}\left(\frac{15}{32}\right)^n$, where $n$ ranges from $0$ to $\infty$, since that's how many blocks of H's there can be before the final five
This is an infinite geometric series whose sum is $\frac{3/64}{1-(15/32)}=\frac{3}{34}$, so the answer is $\boxed{37}$.
It takes an even number of steps for the object to reach $(2,2)$, so the number of steps the object may have taken is either $4$ or $6$.
If the object took $4$ steps, then it must have gone two steps N and two steps E, in some permutation
There are $\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6$ ways for these four steps of occuring, and the probability is $\frac{6}{4^{4}}$.
If the object took $6$ steps, then it must have gone two steps N and two steps E, and an additional pair of moves that would cancel out, either N/S or W/E
The sequences N,N,N,E,E,S can be permuted in $\frac{6!}{3!2!1!} = 60$ ways
However, if the first four steps of the sequence are N,N,E,E in some permutation, it would have already reached the point $(2,2)$ in four moves
There are $\frac{4!}{2!2!}$ ways to order those four steps and $2!$ ways to determine the order of the remaining two steps, for a total of $12$ sequences that we have to exclude
This gives $60-12=48$ sequences of steps
There are the same number of sequences for the steps N,N,E,E,E,W, so the probability here is $\frac{2 \times 48}{4^6}$.
The total probability is $\frac{6}{4^4} + \frac{96}{4^6} = \frac{3}{64}$, and $m+n= \boxed{67}$.
Because of symmetry, we may find all the possible values for $|a_n - a_{n - 1}|$ and multiply by the number of times this value appears
Each occurs $5 \cdot 8!$, because if you fix $a_n$ and $a_{n + 1}$ there are still $8!$ spots for the others and you can do this $5$ times because there are $5$ places $a_n$ and $a_{n + 1}$ can be.
To find all possible values for $|a_n - a_{n - 1}|$ we have to compute\begin{eqnarray*} |1 - 10| + |1 - 9| + \ldots + |1 - 2|\\ + |2 - 10| + \ldots + |2 - 3| + |2 - 1|\\ + \ldots\\ + |10 - 9| \end{eqnarray*}
This is equivalent to
\[2\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{9}\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{k}j = 330\]
The total number of permutations is $10!$, so the average value is $\frac {330 \cdot  8!  \cdot  5}{10!} = \frac {55}{3}$, and $m+n = \boxed{58}$.
On his first pass, he opens all of the odd lockers
So there are only even lockers closed
Then he opens the lockers that are multiples of $4$, leaving only lockers $2 \pmod{8}$ and $6 \pmod{8}$
Then he goes ahead and opens all lockers $2 \pmod {8}$, leaving lockers either $6 \pmod {16}$ or $14 \pmod {16}$
He then goes ahead and opens all lockers $14 \pmod {16}$, leaving the lockers either $6 \pmod {32}$ or $22 \pmod {32}$
He then goes ahead and opens all lockers $6 \pmod {32}$, leaving $22 \pmod {64}$ or $54 \pmod {64}$
He then opens $54 \pmod {64}$, leaving $22 \pmod {128}$ or $86 \pmod {128}$
He then opens $22 \pmod {128}$ and leaves $86 \pmod {256}$ and $214 \pmod {256}$
He then opens all $214 \pmod {256}$, so we have $86 \pmod {512}$ and $342 \pmod {512}$, leaving lockers $86, 342, 598$, and $854$, and he is at where he started again
He then opens $86$ and $598$, and then goes back and opens locker number $854$, leaving locker number $\boxed{342}$ untouched
He opens that locker.
Case 1: All three attributes are the same
This is impossible since sets contain distinct cards.
Case 2: Two of the three attributes are the same
There are ${3\choose 2}$ ways to pick the two attributes in question
Then there are $3$ ways to pick the value of the first attribute, $3$ ways to pick the value of the second attribute, and $1$ way to arrange the positions of the third attribute, giving us ${3\choose 2} \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27$ ways.
Case 3: One of the three attributes are the same
There are ${3\choose 1}$ ways to pick the one attribute in question, and then $3$ ways to pick the value of that attribute
Then there are $3!$ ways to arrange the positions of the next two attributes, giving us ${3\choose 1} \cdot 3 \cdot 3! = 54$ ways.
Case 4: None of the three attributes are the same
We fix the order of the first attribute, and then there are $3!$ ways to pick the ordering of the second attribute and $3!$ ways to pick the ordering of the third attribute
This gives us $(3!)^2 = 36$ ways.
Adding the cases up, we get $27 + 54 + 36 = \boxed{117}$.
To determine the two horizontal sides of a rectangle, we have to pick two of the horizontal lines of the checkerboard, or ${9\choose 2} = 36$
Similarily, there are ${9\choose 2}$ ways to pick the vertical sides, giving us $r = 1296$ rectangles.
For $s$, there are $8^2$ unit squares, $7^2$ of the $2\times2$ squares, and so on until $1^2$ of the $8\times 8$ squares
Using the sum of squares formula, that gives us $s=1^2+2^2+\cdots+8^2=\dfrac{(8)(8+1)(2\cdot8+1)}{6}=12*17=204$.
Thus $\frac sr = \dfrac{204}{1296}=\dfrac{17}{108}$, and $m+n=\boxed{125}$.
The problem is asking us for all configurations of $4\times 4$ grids with 2 1's and 2 -1's in each row and column
We do casework upon the first two columns:
The first two columns share no two numbers in the same row
There are ${4\choose2} = 6$ ways to pick two 1's in the first column, and the second column is determined
For the third and fourth columns, no two numbers can be in the same row (to make the sum of each row 0), so again there are ${4\choose 2}$ ways
This gives $6^2 = 36$.
The first two columns share one number in the same row
There are ${4\choose 1} = 4$ ways to pick the position of the shared 1, then ${3\choose 2} = 3$ ways to pick the locations for the next two 1s, and then $2$ ways to orient the 1s
For the third and fourth columns, the two rows with shared 1s or -1s are fixed, so the only things that can be changed is the orientation of the mixed rows, in $2$ ways
This gives $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 48$.
The first two columns share two numbers in the same row
There are ${4\choose 2} = 6$ ways to pick the position of the shared 1s
Everything is then fixed.
Adding these cases up, we get $36 + 48 + 6 = \boxed{90}$.
In order for a player to have an odd sum, he must have an odd number of odd tiles: that is, he can either have three odd tiles, or two even tiles and an odd tile
Thus, since there are $5$ odd tiles and $4$ even tiles, the only possibility is that one player gets $3$ odd tiles and the other two players get $2$ even tiles and $1$ odd tile
We count the number of ways this can happen
(We will count assuming that it matters in what order the people pick the tiles; the final answer is the same if we assume the opposite, that order doesn't matter.)
$\dbinom{5}{3} = 10$ choices for the tiles that he gets
The other two odd tiles can be distributed to the other two players in $2$ ways, and the even tiles can be distributed between them in $\dbinom{4}{2} \cdot \dbinom{2}{2} = 6$ ways
This gives us a total of $10 \cdot 2 \cdot 6 = 120$ possibilities in which all three people get odd sums.
In order to calculate the probability, we need to know the total number of possible distributions for the tiles
The first player needs three tiles which we can give him in $\dbinom{9}{3} = 84$ ways, and the second player needs three of the remaining six, which we can give him in $\dbinom{6}{3} = 20$ ways
Finally, the third player will simply take the remaining tiles in $1$ way
So, there are $\dbinom{9}{3} \cdot \dbinom{6}{3} \cdot 1 = 84 \cdot 20 = 1680$ ways total to distribute the tiles.
We must multiply the probability by 3, since any of the 3 players can have the 3 odd tiles.Thus, the total probability is $\frac{360}{1680} = \frac{3}{14},$ so the answer is $3 + 14 = \boxed{17}$.
Define $x_i = 2y_i - 1$
Then $2\left(\sum_{i = 1}^4 y_i\right) - 4 = 98$, so $\sum_{i = 1}^4 y_i = 51$.
So we want to find four natural numbers that sum up to 51; we can imagine this as trying to split up 51 on the number line into 4 ranges
This is equivalent to trying to place 3 markers on the numbers 1 through 50; thus the answer is $n = {50\choose3} = \frac{50 * 49 * 48}{3 * 2} = 19600$, and $\frac n{100} = \boxed{196}$.
Let the two mathematicians be $M_1$ and $M_2$
Consider plotting the times that they are on break on a coordinate plane with one axis being the time $M_1$ arrives and the second axis being the time $M_2$ arrives (in minutes past 9 a.m.)
The two mathematicians meet each other when $|M_1-M_2| \leq m$
Also because the mathematicians arrive between 9 and 10, $0 \leq M_1,M_2 \leq 60$
Therefore, $60\times 60$ square represents the possible arrival times of the mathematicians, while the shaded region represents the arrival times where they meet.[asy] import graph; size(180); real m=60-12*sqrt(15); draw((0,0)--(60,0)--(60,60)--(0,60)--cycle); fill((m,0)--(60,60-m)--(60,60)--(60-m,60)--(0,m)--(0,0)--cycle,lightgray); draw((m,0)--(60,60-m)--(60,60)--(60-m,60)--(0,m)--(0,0)--cycle); xaxis("$M_1$",-10,80); yaxis("$M_2$",-10,80); label(rotate(45)*"$M_1-M_2\le m$",((m+60)/2,(60-m)/2),NW,fontsize(9)); label(rotate(45)*"$M_1-M_2\ge -m$",((60-m)/2,(m+60)/2),SE,fontsize(9)); label("$m$",(m,0),S); label("$m$",(0,m),W); label("$60$",(60,0),S); label("$60$",(0,60),W); [/asy]It's easier to compute the area of the unshaded region over the area of the total region, which is the probability that the mathematicians do not meet:
$\frac{(60-m)^2}{60^2} = .6$
$(60-m)^2 = 36\cdot 60$
$60 - m = 12\sqrt{15}$
$\Rightarrow m = 60-12\sqrt{15}$
So the answer is $60 + 12 + 15 = \boxed{87}$.
There are ${40 \choose 2} = 780$ total pairings of teams, and thus $2^{780}$ possible outcomes
In order for no two teams to win the same number of games, they must each win a different number of games
Since the minimum and maximum possible number of games won are 0 and 39 respectively, and there are 40 teams in total, each team corresponds uniquely with some $k$, with $0 \leq k \leq 39$, where $k$ represents the number of games the team won
With this in mind, we see that there are a total of $40!$ outcomes in which no two teams win the same number of games
Further, note that these are all the valid combinations, as the team with 1 win must beat the team with 0 wins, the team with 2 wins must beat the teams with 1 and 0 wins, and so on; thus, this uniquely defines a combination.
The desired probability is thus $\frac{40!}{2^{780}}$
We wish to simplify this into the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime
The only necessary step is to factor out all the powers of 2 from $40!$; the remaining number is clearly relatively prime to all powers of 2.
The number of powers of 2 in $40!$ is $\left \lfloor \frac{40}{2} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{40}{4} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{40}{8} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{40}{16} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{40}{32} \right \rfloor = 20 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 38.$
$780-38 = \boxed{742}$.
For each $i$th switch (designated by $x_{i},y_{i},z_{i}$), it advances itself only one time at the $i$th step; thereafter, only a switch with larger $x_{j},y_{j},z_{j}$ values will advance the $i$th switch by one step provided $d_{i}= 2^{x_{i}}3^{y_{i}}5^{z_{i}}$ divides $d_{j}= 2^{x_{j}}3^{y_{j}}5^{z_{j}}$
Let $N = 2^{9}3^{9}5^{9}$ be the max switch label
To find the divisor multiples in the range of $d_{i}$ to $N$, we consider the exponents of the number $\frac{N}{d_{i}}= 2^{9-x_{i}}3^{9-y_{i}}5^{9-z_{i}}$
In general, the divisor-count of $\frac{N}{d}$ must be a multiple of 4 to ensure that a switch is in position A:
$4n = [(9-x)+1] [(9-y)+1] [(9-z)+1] = (10-x)(10-y)(10-z)$, where $0 \le x,y,z \le 9.$
We consider the cases where the 3 factors above do not contribute multiples of 4.
Case of no 2's:
The switches must be $(\mathrm{odd})(\mathrm{odd})(\mathrm{odd})$
There are $5$ odd integers in $0$ to $9$, so we have $5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125$ ways.
Case of a single 2:
The switches must be one of $(2\cdot \mathrm{odd})(\mathrm{odd})(\mathrm{odd})$ or $(\mathrm{odd})(2 \cdot \mathrm{odd})(\mathrm{odd})$ or $(\mathrm{odd})(\mathrm{odd})(2 \cdot \mathrm{odd})$.
Since $0 \le x,y,z \le 9,$ the terms $2\cdot 1, 2 \cdot 3,$ and $2 \cdot 5$ are three valid choices for the $(2 \cdot odd)$ factor above.
We have ${3\choose{1}} \cdot 3 \cdot 5^{2}= 225$ ways.
The number of switches in position A is $1000-125-225 = \boxed{650}$.
There are ${38 \choose 2} = 703$ ways we can draw two cards from the reduced deck
The two cards will form a pair if both are one of the nine numbers that were not removed, which can happen in $9{4 \choose 2} = 54$ ways, or if the two cards are the remaining two cards of the number that was removed, which can happen in $1$ way
Thus, the answer is $\frac{54+1}{703} = \frac{55}{703}$, and $m+n = \boxed{758}$.
There are $\binom{8}{5}$ ways to choose the rings, and there are $5!$ distinct arrangements to order the rings [we order them so that the first ring is the bottom-most on the first finger that actually has a ring, and so forth]
The number of ways to distribute the rings among the fingers is equivalent the number of ways we can drop five balls into 4 urns, or similarly dropping five balls into four compartments split by three dividers
The number of ways to arrange those dividers and balls is just $\binom {8}{3}$.
Multiplying gives the answer: $\binom{8}{5}\binom{8}{3}5! = 376320$, and the three leftmost digits are $\boxed{376}$.
Multiplying both sides by $19!$ yields:
\[\frac {19!}{2!17!}+\frac {19!}{3!16!}+\frac {19!}{4!15!}+\frac {19!}{5!14!}+\frac {19!}{6!13!}+\frac {19!}{7!12!}+\frac {19!}{8!11!}+\frac {19!}{9!10!}=\frac {19!N}{1!18!}.\]
\[\binom{19}{2}+\binom{19}{3}+\binom{19}{4}+\binom{19}{5}+\binom{19}{6}+\binom{19}{7}+\binom{19}{8}+\binom{19}{9} = 19N.\]
Recall the Combinatorial Identity $2^{19} = \sum_{n=0}^{19} {19 \choose n}$
Since ${19 \choose n} = {19 \choose 19-n}$, it follows that $\sum_{n=0}^{9} {19 \choose n} = \frac{2^{19}}{2} = 2^{18}$.
Thus, $19N = 2^{18}-\binom{19}{1}-\binom{19}{0}=2^{18}-19-1 = (2^9)^2-20 = (512)^2-20 = 262124$.
So, $N=\frac{262124}{19}=13796$ and $\left\lfloor \frac{N}{100} \right\rfloor =\boxed{137}$.
The distance between the $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates must be even so that the midpoint can have integer coordinates
Therefore,
For $x$, we have the possibilities $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,0)$, $5$ possibilities.
For $y$, we have the possibilities $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(3,3)$, $(0,2)$, $(2,0)$, $(1,3)$, and $(3,1)$, $8$ possibilities.
For $z$, we have the possibilities $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(3,3)$, $(4,4)$, $(0,2)$, $(0,4)$, $(2,0)$, $(4,0)$, $(2,4)$, $(4,2)$, $(1,3)$, and $(3,1)$, $13$ possibilities.
However, we have $3\cdot 4\cdot 5 = 60$ cases where we have simply taken the same point twice, so we subtract those
Therefore, our answer is $\frac {5\cdot 8\cdot 13 - 60}{60\cdot 59} = \frac {23}{177}\Longrightarrow m+n = \boxed{200}$.
Let $0$ represent a house that does not receive mail and $1$ represent a house that does receive mail
This problem is now asking for the number of $19$-digit strings of $0$'s and $1$'s such that there are no two consecutive $1$'s and no three consecutive $0$'s.
The last two digits of any $n$-digit string can't be $11$, so the only possibilities are $00$, $01$, and $10$.
Let $a_n$ be the number of $n$-digit strings ending in $00$, $b_n$ be the number of $n$-digit strings ending in $01$, and $c_n$ be the number of $n$-digit strings ending in $10$.
If an $n$-digit string ends in $00$, then the previous digit must be a $1$, and the last two digits of the $n-1$ digits substring will be $10$
So\[a_{n} = c_{n-1}.\]
If an $n$-digit string ends in $01$, then the previous digit can be either a $0$ or a $1$, and the last two digits of the $n-1$ digits substring can be either $00$ or $10$
So\[b_{n} = a_{n-1} + c_{n-1}.\]
If an $n$-digit string ends in $10$, then the previous digit must be a $0$, and the last two digits of the $n-1$ digits substring will be $01$
So\[c_{n} = b_{n-1}.\]
Clearly, $a_2=b_2=c_2=1$
Using the recursive equations and initial values:\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \multicolumn{19}{c}{}\\\hline n&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12&13&14&15&16&17&18&19\\\hline a_n&1&1&1&2&2&3&4&5&7&9&12&16&21&28&37&49&65&86\\\hline b_n&1&2&2&3&4&5&7&9&12&16&21&28&37&49&65&86&114&151\\\hline c_n&1&1&2&2&3&4&5&7&9&12&16&21&28&37&49&65&86&114\\\hline \end{array}\]
As a result $a_{19}+b_{19}+c_{19}=\boxed{351}$.
Choose one face of the octahedron randomly and label it with $1$
There are three faces adjacent to this one, which we will call A-faces
There are three faces adjacent to two of the A-faces, which we will call B-faces, and one face adjacent to the three B-faces, which we will call the C-face.
Clearly, the labels for the A-faces must come from the set $\{3,4,5,6,7\}$, since these faces are all adjacent to $1$
There are thus $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60$ ways to assign the labels for the A-faces.
The labels for the B-faces and C-face are the two remaining numbers from the above set, plus $2$ and $8$
The number on the C-face must not be consecutive to any of the numbers on the B-faces.
From here it is easiest to brute force the $10$ possibilities for the $4$ numbers on the B and C faces:
2348 (2678): 8(2) is the only one not adjacent to any of the others, so it goes on the C-face
4(6) has only one B-face it can go to, while 2 and 3 (7 and 8) can be assigned randomly to the last two
2 possibilities here.
2358 (2578): 5 cannot go on any of the B-faces, so it must be on the C-face
3 and 8 (2 and 7) have only one allowable B-face, so just 1 possibility here.
2368 (2478): 6(4) cannot go on any of the B-faces, so it must be on the C-face
3 and 8 (2 and 7) have only one allowable B-face, so 1 possibility here.
2458 (2568): All of the numbers have only one B-face they could go to
2 and 4 (6 and 8) can go on the same, so one must go to the C-face
Only 2(8) is not consecutive with any of the others, so it goes on the C-face
1 possibility.
2378: None of the numbers can go on the C-face because they will be consecutive with one of the B-face numbers
So this possibility is impossible.
2468: Both 4 and 6 cannot go on any B-face
They cannot both go on the C-face, so this possibility is impossible.
There is a total of $10$ possibilities
There are $3!=6$ permutations (more like "rotations") of each, so $60$ acceptable ways to fill in the rest of the octahedron given the $1$
There are $7!=5040$ ways to randomly fill in the rest of the octahedron
So the probability is $\frac {60}{5040} = \frac {1}{84}$
The answer is $\boxed{85}$.
Note that the probability that Club Truncator will have more wins than losses is equal to the probability that it will have more losses than wins; the only other possibility is that they have the same number of wins and losses
Thus, by the complement principle, the desired probability is half the probability that Club Truncator does not have the same number of wins and losses.
The possible ways to achieve the same number of wins and losses are $0$ ties, $3$ wins and $3$ losses; $2$ ties, $2$ wins, and $2$ losses; $4$ ties, $1$ win, and $1$ loss; or $6$ ties
Since there are $6$ games, there are $\frac{6!}{3!3!}$ ways for the first, and $\frac{6!}{2!2!2!}$, $\frac{6!}{4!}$, and $1$ ways for the rest, respectively, out of a total of $3^6$
This gives a probability of $141/729$
Then the desired answer is $\frac{1 - \frac{141}{729}}{2} = \frac{98}{243}$, so the answer is $m+n = \boxed{341}$.
Let $S$ be the percent of people who study Spanish, $F$ be the number of people who study French, and let $S \cup F$ be the number of students who study both
Then $\left\lceil 80\% \cdot 2001 \right\rceil = 1601 \le S \le \left\lfloor 85\% \cdot 2001 \right\rfloor = 1700$, and $\left\lceil 30\% \cdot 2001 \right\rceil = 601 \le F \le \left\lfloor 40\% \cdot 2001 \right\rfloor = 800$
By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion,
\[S+F- S \cap F = S \cup F = 2001\]
For $m = S \cap F$ to be smallest, $S$ and $F$ must be minimized.
\[1601 + 601 - m = 2001 \Longrightarrow m = 201\]
For $M = S \cap F$ to be largest, $S$ and $F$ must be maximized.
\[1700 + 800 - M = 2001 \Longrightarrow M = 499\]
Therefore, the answer is $M - m = 499 - 201 = \boxed{298}$.
Out of all ten-element subsets with distinct elements that do not possess the triangle property, we want to find the one with the smallest maximum element
Call this subset $\mathcal{S}$
Without loss of generality, consider any $a, b, c \,\in \mathcal{S}$ with $a < b < c$
$\,\mathcal{S}$ does not possess the triangle property, so $c \geq a + b$
We use this property to build up $\mathcal{S}$ from the smallest possible $a$ and $b$:
\[\mathcal{S} = \{\, 4,\, 5,\, 4+5, \,5+(4+5),\, \ldots\,\} = \{4, 5, 9, 14, 23, 37, 60, 97, 157, 254\}\]
$\mathcal{S}$ is the "smallest" ten-element subset without the triangle property, and since the set $\{4, 5, 6, \ldots, 253\}$ is the largest set of consecutive integers that does not contain this subset, it is also the largest set of consecutive integers in which all ten-element subsets possess the triangle property
Thus, our answer is $n = \boxed{253}$.
We can use complementary counting, counting all of the colorings that have at least one red $2\times 2$ square.
For at least one red $2 \times 2$ square:
There are four $2 \times 2$ squares to choose which one will be red
Then there are $2^5$ ways to color the rest of the squares
$4*32=128$
For at least two $2 \times 2$ squares:
There are two cases: those with two red squares on one side and those without red squares on one side.
The first case is easy: 4 ways to choose which the side the squares will be on, and $2^3$ ways to color the rest of the squares, so 32 ways to do that
For the second case, there will by only two ways to pick two squares, and $2^2$ ways to color the other squares
$32+8=40$
For at least three $2 \times 2$ squares:
Choosing three such squares leaves only one square left, with four places to place it
This is $2 \cdot 4 = 8$ ways.
For at least four $2 \times 2$ squares, we clearly only have one way.
By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, there are (alternatively subtracting and adding) $128-40+8-1=95$ ways to have at least one red $2 \times 2$ square.
There are $2^9=512$ ways to paint the $3 \times 3$ square with no restrictions, so there are $512-95=417$ ways to paint the square with the restriction
Therefore, the probability of obtaining a grid that does not have a $2 \times 2$ red square is $\frac{417}{512}$, and $417+512=\boxed{929}$.
Consider the three-digit arrangement, $\overline{aba}$
There are $10$ choices for $a$ and $10$ choices for $b$ (since it is possible for $a=b$), and so the probability of picking the palindrome is $\frac{10 \times 10}{10^3} = \frac 1{10}$
Similarly, there is a $\frac 1{26}$ probability of picking the three-letter palindrome.
By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the total probability is
$\frac{1}{26}+\frac{1}{10}-\frac{1}{260}=\frac{35}{260}=\frac{7}{52}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad7+52=\boxed{59}$
Let Jane's age $n$ years from now be $10a+b$, and let Dick's age be $10b+a$
If $10b+a>10a+b$, then $b>a$
The possible pairs of $a,b$ are:
$(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), \dots , (8,9)$
That makes 36
But $10a+b>25$, so we subtract all the extraneous pairs: $(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (1,4), (2,4), (1,5), (2,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8),$ and $(1,9)$
$36-11=\boxed{25}$
\begin{align*}
\dbinom{8}{4} &= \dfrac{8!}{4!4!} \\
&= \dfrac{8\times 7\times 6\times 5}{4\times 3\times 2\times 1} \\
&= \dfrac{8}{4\times 2\times 1}\times 7 \times \dfrac{6}{3} \times 5 \\
&= 1\times 7\times 2\times 5 \\
&= \boxed{70}.
\end{align*}
Let the two disjoint subsets be $A$ and $B$, and let $C = S-(A+B)$
For each $i \in S$, either $i \in A$, $i \in B$, or $i \in C$
So there are $3^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ into disjoint $A$, $B$, and $C$.
However, there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $A = \emptyset$ and $S = B+C$, and there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $B = \emptyset$ and $S = A+C$
But, the combination such that $A = B = \emptyset$ and $S = C$ is counted twice.
Thus, there are $3^{10}-2\cdot2^{10}+1$ ordered pairs of sets $(A,B)$
But since the question asks for the number of unordered sets $\{ A,B \}$, $n = \frac{1}{2}(3^{10}-2\cdot2^{10}+1) = 28501 \equiv \boxed{501} \pmod{1000}$.
In base-$2$ representation, all positive numbers have a leftmost digit of $1$
Thus there are ${n \choose k}$ numbers that have $n+1$ digits in base $2$ notation, with $k+1$ of the digits being $1$'s.
In order for there to be more $1$'s than $0$'s, we must have $k+1 > \frac{d+1}{2} \Longrightarrow k > \frac{d-1}{2} \Longrightarrow k \ge \frac{d}{2}$
Therefore, the number of such numbers corresponds to the sum of all numbers on or to the right of the vertical line of symmetry in Pascal's Triangle, from rows $0$ to $10$ (as $2003 < 2^{11}-1$)
Since the sum of the elements of the $r$th row is $2^r$, it follows that the sum of all elements in rows $0$ through $10$ is $2^0 + 2^1 + \cdots + 2^{10} = 2^{11}-1 = 2047$
The center elements are in the form ${2i \choose i}$, so the sum of these elements is $\sum_{i=0}^{5} {2i \choose i} = 1 + 2 +6 + 20 + 70 + 252 = 351$.
The sum of the elements on or to the right of the line of symmetry is thus $\frac{2047 + 351}{2} = 1199$
However, we also counted the $44$ numbers from $2004$ to $2^{11}-1 = 2047$
Indeed, all of these numbers have at least $6$ $1$'s in their base-$2$ representation, as all of them are greater than $1984 = 11111000000_2$, which has $5$ $1$'s
Therefore, our answer is $1199 - 44 = 1155$, and the remainder is $\boxed{155}$.

Since there are $8$ vertices of a cube, there are ${8 \choose 3} = 56$ total triangles to consider
They fall into three categories: there are those which are entirely contained within a single face of the cube (whose sides are two edges and one face diagonal), those which lie in a plane perpendicular to one face of the cube (whose sides are one edge, one face diagonal and one space diagonal of the cube) and those which lie in a plane oblique to the edges of the cube, whose sides are three face diagonals of the cube.
Each face of the cube contains ${4\choose 3} = 4$ triangles of the first type, and there are $6$ faces, so there are $24$ triangles of the first type
Each of these is a right triangle with legs of length $1$, so each triangle of the first type has area $\frac 12$.
Each edge of the cube is a side of exactly $2$ of the triangles of the second type, and there are $12$ edges, so there are $24$ triangles of the second type
Each of these is a right triangle with legs of length $1$ and $\sqrt 2$, so each triangle of the second type has area $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
Each vertex of the cube is associated with exactly one triangle of the third type (whose vertices are its three neighbors), and there are $8$ vertices of the cube, so there are $8$ triangles of the third type
Each of the these is an equilateral triangle with sides of length $\sqrt 2$, so each triangle of the third type has area $\frac{\sqrt 3}2$.
Thus the total area of all these triangles is $24 \cdot \frac12 + 24\cdot\frac{\sqrt2}2 + 8\cdot\frac{\sqrt3}2 = 12 + 12\sqrt2 + 4\sqrt3 = 12 + \sqrt{288} + \sqrt{48}$ and the answer is $12 + 288 + 48 = \boxed{348}$.
If the common sum of the first two and last two digits is $n$, such that $1 \leq n \leq 9$, there are $n$ choices for the first two digits and $n + 1$ choices for the second two digits (since zero may not be the first digit)
This gives $\sum_{n = 1}^9 n(n + 1) = 330$ balanced numbers
If the common sum of the first two and last two digits is $n$, such that $10 \leq n \leq 18$, there are $19 - n$ choices for both pairs
This gives $\sum_{n = 10}^{18} (19 - n)^2 = \sum_{n = 1}^9 n^2 = 285$ balanced numbers
Thus, there are in total $330 + 285 = \boxed{615}$ balanced numbers.
Both summations may be calculated using the formula for the sum of consecutive squares, namely $\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$.
Let $P_n$ represent the probability that the bug is at its starting vertex after $n$ moves
If the bug is on its starting vertex after $n$ moves, then it must be not on its starting vertex after $n-1$ moves
At this point it has $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of reaching the starting vertex in the next move
Thus $P_n=\frac{1}{2}(1-P_{n-1})$
$P_0=1$, so now we can build it up:
$P_1=0$, $P_2=\frac{1}{2}$, $P_3=\frac{1}{4}$, $P_4=\frac{3}{8}$, $P_5=\frac{5}{16}$, $P_6=\frac{11}{32}$, $P_7=\frac{21}{64}$, $P_8=\frac{43}{128}$, $P_9=\frac{85}{256}$, $P_{10}=\frac{171}{512}$,
Thus the answer is $171+512=\boxed{683}$
We use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE).
If we join the adjacent vertices of the regular $n$-star, we get a regular $n$-gon
We number the vertices of this $n$-gon in a counterclockwise direction: $0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n-1.$
A regular $n$-star will be formed if we choose a vertex number $m$, where $0 \le m \le n-1$, and then form the line segments by joining the following pairs of vertex numbers: $(0 \mod{n}, m \mod{n}),$ $(m \mod{n}, 2m \mod{n}),$ $(2m \mod{n}, 3m \mod{n}),$ $\cdots,$ $((n-2)m \mod{n}, (n-1)m \mod{n}),$ $((n-1)m \mod{n}, 0 \mod{n}).$
If $\gcd(m,n) > 1$, then the star degenerates into a regular $\frac{n}{\gcd(m,n)}$-gon or a (2-vertex) line segment if $\frac{n}{\gcd(m,n)}= 2$
Therefore, we need to find all $m$ such that $\gcd(m,n) = 1$.
Note that $n = 1000 = 2^{3}5^{3}.$
Let $S = \{1,2,3,\ldots, 1000\}$, and $A_{i}= \{i \in S \mid i\, \textrm{ divides }\,1000\}$
The number of $m$'s that are not relatively prime to $1000$ is: $\mid A_{2}\cup A_{5}\mid = \mid A_{2}\mid+\mid A_{5}\mid-\mid A_{2}\cap A_{5}\mid$ $= \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{2}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor \frac{1000}{5}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor \frac{1000}{2 \cdot 5}\right\rfloor$ $= 500+200-100 = 600.$
Vertex numbers $1$ and $n-1=999$ must be excluded as values for $m$ since otherwise a regular n-gon, instead of an n-star, is formed.
The cases of a 1st line segment of (0, m) and (0, n-m) give the same star
Therefore we should halve the count to get non-similar stars.
Therefore, the number of non-similar 1000-pointed stars is $\frac{1000-600-2}{2}= \boxed{199}.$
The probability that Terry picks two red candies is $\frac{10 \cdot 9}{20 \cdot 19} = \frac{9}{38}$, and the probability that Mary picks two red candies after Terry chooses two red candies is $\frac{7\cdot8}{18\cdot17} = \frac{28}{153}$
So the probability that they both pick two red candies is $\frac{9}{38} \cdot \frac{28}{153} = \frac{14}{323}$
The same calculation works for the blue candies.
The probability that Terry picks two different candies is $\frac{20\cdot10}{20\cdot19} = \frac{10}{19}$, and the probability that Mary picks two different candies after Terry picks two different candies is $\frac{18\cdot 9}{18\cdot 17} = \frac{9}{17}$
Thus, the probability that they both choose two different candies is $\frac{10}{19}\cdot\frac{9}{17} = \frac{90}{323}$
Then the total probability is
\[2 \cdot \frac{14}{323} + \frac{90}{323} = \frac{118}{323}\]
and so the answer is $118 + 323 = \boxed{441}$.
In the above calculations, we treated the choices as ordered; that is, Terry chose first one candy, then a second, and so on
We could also solve the problem using unordered choices
The probabilities calculated will all be the same, but the calculations will appear somewhat different
For instance, the probability that Mary chooses two red candies after Terry chose two red candies will have the form $\frac{{8\choose 2}}{{18 \choose 2}}$, and the probability that Terry chooses two different candies will have the form $\frac{{10\choose 1}\cdot{10\choose 1}}{{20\choose2}}$
It is not difficult to see that these yield the same results as our calculations above, as we would expect.
First, let's count numbers with only a single digit
We have nine of these for each length, and four lengths, so 36 total numbers.
Now, let's count those with two distinct digits
We handle the cases "0 included" and "0 not included" separately.
There are ${9 \choose 2}$ ways to choose two digits, $A$ and $B$
Given two digits, there are $2^n - 2$ ways to arrange them in an $n$-digit number, for a total of $(2^1 - 2) + (2^2 - 2) + (2^3 -2) + (2^4 - 2) = 22$ such numbers (or we can list them: $AB, BA, AAB, ABA, BAA, ABB, BAB, BBA, AAAB, AABA, ABAA,$ $BAAA, AABB, ABAB, BAAB, ABBA, BABA, BBAA, ABBB, BABB, BBAB, BBBA$)
Thus, we have ${9 \choose 2} \cdot 22 = 36\cdot22 = 792$ numbers of this form.
Now, suppose 0 is one of our digits
We have nine choices for the other digit
For each choice, we have $2^{n - 1} - 1$ $n$-digit numbers we can form, for a total of $(2^0 - 1) + (2^1 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^3 - 1) = 11$ such numbers (or we can list them: $A0, A00, A0A, AA0, A000, AA00, A0A0, A00A, AAA0, AA0A, A0AA$)
This gives us $9\cdot 11 = 99$ numbers of this form.
Thus, in total, we have $36 + 792 + 99 = \boxed{927}$ such numbers.
The length of the path (the number of times the particle moves) can range from $l = 5$ to $9$; notice that $d = 10-l$ gives the number of diagonals
Let $R$ represent a move to the right, $U$ represent a move upwards, and $D$ to be a move that is diagonal
Casework upon the number of diagonal moves:
Case $d = 1$: It is easy to see only $2$ cases.
Case $d = 2$: There are two diagonals
We need to generate a string with $3$ $R$'s, $3$ $U$'s, and $2$ $D$'s such that no two $R$'s or $U$'s are adjacent
The $D$'s split the string into three sections ($-D-D-$): by the Pigeonhole principle all of at least one of the two letters must be all together (i.e., stay in a row).
If both $R$ and $U$ stay together, then there are $3 \cdot 2=6$ ways.
If either $R$ or $U$ splits, then there are $3$ places to put the letter that splits, which has $2$ possibilities
The remaining letter must divide into $2$ in one section and $1$ in the next, giving $2$ ways
This totals $6 + 3\cdot 2\cdot 2 = 18$ ways.
Case $d = 3$: Now $2$ $R$'s, $2$ $U$'s, and $3$ $D$'s, so the string is divided into $4$ partitions ($-D-D-D-$).
If the $R$'s and $U$'s stay together, then there are $4 \cdot 3 = 12$ places to put them.
If one of them splits and the other stays together, then there are $4 \cdot {3\choose 2}$ places to put them, and $2$ ways to pick which splits, giving $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 24$ ways.
If both groups split, then there are ${4\choose 2}=6$ ways to arrange them
These add up to $12 + 24 + 6 = 42$ ways.
Case $d = 4$: Now $1$ $R$, $1$ $U$, $4$ $D$'s ($-D-D-D-D-$)
There are $5$ places to put $R$, $4$ places to put $U$, giving $20$ ways.
Case $d = 5$: It is easy to see only $1$ case.
Together, these add up to $2 + 18 + 42 + 20 + 1 = \boxed{83}$.
There are two separate parts to this problem: one is the color (gold vs silver), and the other is the orientation.
There are ${8\choose4} = 70$ ways to position the gold coins in the stack of 8 coins, which determines the positions of the silver coins.
Create a string of letters H and T to denote the orientation of the top of the coin
To avoid making two faces touch, we cannot have the arrangement HT
Thus, all possible configurations must be a string of tails followed by a string of heads, since after the first H no more tails can appear
The first H can occur in a maximum of eight times different positions, and then there is also the possibility that it doesn’t occur at all, for $9$ total configurations
Thus, the answer is $70 \cdot 9 = \boxed{630}$.
Use construction
We need only calculate the probability the first and second person all get a roll of each type, since then the rolls for the third person are determined.
Person 1: $\frac{9 \cdot 6 \cdot 3}{9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7} = \frac{9}{28}$
Person 2: $\frac{6 \cdot 4 \cdot 2}{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4} = \frac 25$
Person 3: One roll of each type is left, so the probability here is $1$.
Our answer is thus $\frac{9}{28} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{9}{70}$, and $m + n = \boxed{79}$.
Since a card from B is placed on the bottom of the new stack, notice that cards from pile B will be marked as an even number in the new pile, while cards from pile A will be marked as odd in the new pile
Since 131 is odd and retains its original position in the stack, it must be in pile A
Also to retain its original position, exactly $131 - 1 = 130$ numbers must be in front of it
There are $\frac{130}{2} = 65$ cards from each of piles A, B in front of card 131
This suggests that $n = 131 + 65 = 196$; the total number of cards is $196 \cdot 2 = \boxed{392}$.
We proceed recursively
Suppose we can build $T_m$ towers using blocks of size $1, 2, \ldots, m$
How many towers can we build using blocks of size $1, 2, \ldots, m, m + 1$? If we remove the block of size $m + 1$ from such a tower (keeping all other blocks in order), we get a valid tower using blocks $1, 2, \ldots, m$
Given a tower using blocks $1, 2, \ldots, m$ (with $m \geq 2$), we can insert the block of size $m + 1$ in exactly 3 places: at the beginning, immediately following the block of size $m - 1$ or immediately following the block of size $m$
Thus, there are 3 times as many towers using blocks of size $1, 2, \ldots, m, m + 1$ as there are towers using only $1, 2, \ldots, m$
There are 2 towers which use blocks $1, 2$, so there are $2\cdot 3^6 = 1458$ towers using blocks $1, 2, \ldots, 8$, so the answer is $\boxed{458}$.
The smallest $S$ is $1+2+ \ldots +90 = 91 \cdot 45 = 4095$
The largest $S$ is $11+12+ \ldots +100=111\cdot 45=4995$
All numbers between $4095$ and $4995$ are possible values of S, so the number of possible values of S is $4995-4095+1=901$.
Alternatively, for ease of calculation, let set $\mathcal{B}$ be a 10-element subset of $\{1,2,3,\ldots,100\}$, and let $T$ be the sum of the elements of $\mathcal{B}$
Note that the number of possible $S$ is the number of possible $T=5050-S$
The smallest possible $T$ is $1+2+ \ldots +10 = 55$ and the largest is $91+92+ \ldots + 100 = 955$, so the number of possible values of T, and therefore S, is $955-55+1=\boxed{901}$.
The results of the five remaining games are independent of the first game, so by symmetry, the probability that $A$ scores higher than $B$ in these five games is equal to the probability that $B$ scores higher than $A$
We let this probability be $p$; then the probability that $A$ and $B$ end with the same score in these five games is $1-2p$.
Of these three cases ($|A| > |B|, |A| < |B|, |A|=|B|$), the last is the easiest to calculate (see solution 2 for a way to directly calculate the other cases).
There are ${5\choose k}$ ways to $A$ to have $k$ victories, and ${5\choose k}$ ways for $B$ to have $k$ victories
Summing for all values of $k$,
$1-2p = \frac{1}{2^{5} \times 2^{5}}\left(\sum_{k=0}^{5} {5\choose k}^2\right) = \frac{1^2+5^2+10^2+10^2+5^2+1^2}{1024} = \frac{126}{512}.$
Thus $p = \frac 12 \left(1-\frac{126}{512}\right) = \frac{193}{512}$
The desired probability is the sum of the cases when $|A| \ge |B|$, so the answer is $\frac{126}{512} + \frac{193}{512} = \frac{319}{512}$, and $m+n = \boxed{831}$.
Clearly, $a_6=1$
Now, consider selecting $5$ of the remaining $11$ values
Sort these values in descending order, and sort the other $6$ values in ascending order
Now, let the $5$ selected values be $a_1$ through $a_5$, and let the remaining $6$ be $a_7$ through ${a_{12}}$
It is now clear that there is a bijection between the number of ways to select $5$ values from $11$ and ordered 12-tuples $(a_1,\ldots,a_{12})$
Thus, there will be ${11 \choose 5}=\boxed{462}$ such ordered 12-tuples.
Once a $\diamondsuit$ is dealt, there are only 51 cards left in the deck, so the probability of the second card being a $\spadesuit$ is $\frac{13}{51}$, not $\frac14.$ Therefore, the probability of both cards being the required suits is $\frac14 \times \frac{13}{51} =\boxed{ \frac{13}{204}}.$
There are $\left\lfloor\frac{999}{10}\right\rfloor = 99$ numbers up to 1000 that have 0 as their units digit
All of the other excluded possibilities are when $a$ or $b$ have a 0 in the tens digit, and since the equation is symmetric, we will just count when $a$ has a 0 in the tens digit and multiply by 2 (notice that the only time both $a$ and $b$ can have a 0 in the tens digit is when they are divisible by 100, which falls into the above category, so we do not have to worry about overcounting).
Excluding the numbers divisible by 100, which were counted already, there are $9$ numbers in every hundred numbers that have a tens digit of 0 (this is true from 100 to 900), totaling $9 \cdot 9 = 81$ such numbers; considering $b$ also and we have $81 \cdot 2 = 162$
Therefore, there are $999 - (99 + 162) = \boxed{738}$ such ordered pairs.
Label each of the bottom squares as $x_0, x_1 \ldots x_9, x_{10}$.
Through induction, we can find that the top square is equal to ${10\choose0}x_0 + {10\choose1}x_1 + {10\choose2}x_2 + \ldots {10\choose10}x_{10}$
(This also makes sense based on a combinatorial argument: the number of ways a number can "travel" to the top position going only up is equal to the number of times it will be counted in the final sum.)
Examine the equation $\mod 3$
All of the coefficients from $x_2 \ldots x_8$ will be multiples of $3$ (since the numerator will have a $9$)
Thus, the expression boils down to $x_0 + 10x_1 + 10x_9 + x_{10} \equiv 0 \mod 3$
Reduce to find that $x_0 + x_1 + x_9 + x_{10} \equiv 0 \mod 3$
Out of $x_0,\ x_1,\ x_9,\ x_{10}$, either all are equal to $0$, or three of them are equal to $1$
This gives ${4\choose0} + {4\choose3} = 1 + 4 = 5$ possible combinations of numbers that work.
The seven terms from $x_2 \ldots x_8$ can assume either $0$ or $1$, giving us $2^7$ possibilities
The answer is therefore $5 \cdot 2^7 = \boxed{640}$.
Let $a_n$ and $b_n$ denote, respectively, the number of sequences of length $n$ ending in $A$ and $B$
If a sequence ends in an $A$, then it must have been formed by appending two $A$s to the end of a string of length $n-2$
If a sequence ends in a $B,$ it must have either been formed by appending one $B$ to a string of length $n-1$ ending in an $A$, or by appending two $B$s to a string of length $n-2$ ending in a $B$
Thus, we have the recursions\begin{align*} a_n &= a_{n-2} + b_{n-2}\\ b_n &= a_{n-1} + b_{n-2}  \end{align*}By counting, we find that $a_1 = 0, b_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, b_2 = 0$.\[\begin{array}{|r||r|r|||r||r|r|} \hline n & a_n & b_n & n & a_n & b_n\\ \hline 1&0&1& 8&6&10\\ 2&1&0& 9&11&11\\ 3&1&2& 10&16&21\\ 4&1&1& 11&22&27\\ 5&3&3& 12&37&43\\ 6&2&4& 13&49&64\\ 7&6&5& 14&80&92\\ \hline \end{array}\]Therefore, the number of such strings of length $14$ is $a_{14} + b_{14} = \boxed{172}$.
We label our points using coordinates $0 \le x,y \le 3$, with the bottom-left point being $(0,0)$
By the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance between two points is $\sqrt{d_x^2 + d_y^2}$ where $0 \le d_x, d_y \le 3$; these yield the possible distances (in decreasing order)\[\sqrt{18},\ \sqrt{13},\ \sqrt{10},\ \sqrt{9},\ \sqrt{8},\ \sqrt{5},\ \sqrt{4},\ \sqrt{2},\ \sqrt{1}\]As these define $9$ lengths, so the maximum value of $m$ is $10$
For now, we assume that $m = 10$ is achievable
Because it is difficult to immediately impose restrictions on a path with increasing distances, we consider the paths in shrinking fashion
Note that the shrinking paths and growing paths are equivalent, but there are restrictions upon the locations of the first edges of the former.
The $\sqrt{18}$ length is only possible for one of the long diagonals, so our path must start with one of the $4$ corners of the grid
Without loss of generality (since the grid is rotationally symmetric), we let the vertex be $(0,0)$ and the endpoint be $(3,3)$.
[asy] unitsize(0.25inch); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)); dotfactor = 4; pen s = linewidth(4);  int i, j; for(i = 0; i < 4; ++i) 	for(j = 0; j < 4; ++j) 		dot(((real)i, (real)j)); dot((0,0)^^(3,3),s); draw((0,0)--(3,3));  [/asy]
The $\sqrt{13}$ length can now only go to $2$ points; due to reflectional symmetry about the main diagonal, we may WLOG let the next endpoint be $(1,0)$.
[asy] unitsize(0.25inch); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)); dotfactor = 4; pen s = linewidth(4); pen c = rgb(0.5,0.5,0.5); int i, j; for(i = 0; i < 4; ++i) 	for(j = 0; j < 4; ++j) 		dot(((real)i, (real)j)); dot((0,0)^^(3,3)^^(1,0),s); draw((0,0)--(3,3),c); draw((3,3)--(1,0));  [/asy]
From $(1,0)$, there are two possible ways to move $\sqrt{10}$ away, either to $(0,3)$ or $(2,3)$
However, from $(0,3)$, there is no way to move $\sqrt{9}$ away, so we discard it as a possibility.
From $(2,3)$, the lengths of $\sqrt{8},\ \sqrt{5},\ \sqrt{4},\ \sqrt{2}$ fortunately are all determined, with the endpoint sequence being $(2,3)-(2,0)-(0,2)-(2,1)-(0,1)-(1,2)$.
[asy] unitsize(0.25inch); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)); dotfactor = 4; pen s = linewidth(4); pen c = rgb(0.5,0.5,0.5); int i, j; for(i = 0; i < 4; ++i) 	for(j = 0; j < 4; ++j) 		dot(((real)i, (real)j)); dot((0,0)^^(3,3)^^(1,0)^^(2,3)^^(2,0)^^(0,2)^^(2,1)^^(0,1)^^(1,2),s); draw((0,0)--(3,3)--(1,0)--(2,3)--(2,0)--(0,2)--(2,1)--(0,1)--(1,2)); [/asy]
From $(1,2)$, there are $3$ possible lengths of $\sqrt{1}$ (to either $(1,1),(2,2),(1,3)$)
Thus, the number of paths is $r = 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 24$, and the answer is $mr = 10 \cdot 24 = \boxed{240}$.
The well known problem of ordering $x$ elements of a string of $y$ elements such that none of the $x$ elements are next to each other has ${y-x+1\choose x}$ solutions
We generalize for $a$ blues and $b$ greens
Consider a string of $a+b$ elements such that we want to choose the greens such that none of them are next to each other
We would also like to choose a place where we can divide this string into two strings such that the left one represents the first pole, and the right one represents the second pole, in order up the pole according to position on the string.
However, this method does not account for the fact that the first pole could end with a green, and the second pole could start with a green, since the original string assumed that no greens could be consecutive
We solve this problem by introducing an extra blue, such that we choose our divider by choosing one of these $a+1$ blues, and not including that one as a flag on either pole.
From (1), we now have ${a+2\choose b}$ ways to order the string such that no greens are next to each other, and $a+1$ ways to choose the extra blue that will divide the string into the two poles: or $(a+1){a+2\choose b}$ orderings in total.
However, we have overcounted the solutions where either pole has no flags, we have to count these separately
This is the same as choosing our extra blue as one of the two ends, and ordering the other $a$ blues and $b$ greens such that no greens are next to each other: for a total of $2{a+1\choose b}$ such orderings.
Thus, we have $(a+1){a+2\choose b}-2{a+1\choose b}$ orderings that satisfy the conditions in the problem: plugging in $a=10$ and $b=9$, we get $2310 \equiv \boxed{310} \pmod{1000}$.
Since the 5 members of each planet committee are distinct we get that the number of arrangement of sittings is in the form $N*(5!)^3$ because for each $M, V, E$ sequence we have $5!$ arrangements within the Ms, Vs, and Es.
Pretend the table only seats $3$ "people", with $1$ "person" from each planet
Counting clockwise, only the arrangement M, V, E satisfies the given constraints
Therefore, in the actual problem, the members must sit in cycles of M, V, E, but not necessarily with one M, one V, and one E in each cycle(for example, MMVVVE, MVVVEEE, MMMVVVEE all count as cycles)
These cycles of MVE must start at seat $1$, since an M is at seat $1$
We simply count the number of arrangements through casework.
The entire arrangement is one cycle- There is only one way to arrange this, MMMMMVVVVVEEEEE
Two cycles - There are 3 Ms, Vs and Es left to distribute among the existing MVEMVE
Using stars and bars, we get $\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways for the members of each planet
Therefore, there are $4^3=64$ ways in total.
Three cycles - 2 Ms, Vs, Es left, so $\binom{4}{2}=6$, making there $6^3=216$ ways total.
Four cycles - 1 M, V, E left, each M can go to any of the four MVE cycles and likewise for V and E, $4^3=64$ ways total
Five cycles - MVEMVEMVEMVEMVE is the only possibility, so there is just $1$ way.
Combining all these cases, we get $1+1+64+64+216= \boxed{346}$
Since we have three numbers, consider the number of ways we can put these three numbers together in a string of 7 digits
For example, if $A=113, B=13, C=31$, then the string is
\[1131331.\]
Since the strings have seven digits and three threes, there are $\binom{7}{3}=35$ arrangements of all such strings.
In order to obtain all combination of A,B,C, we partition all the possible strings into 3 groups.
Let's look at the example
We have to partition it into 3 groups with each group having at least 1 digit
In other words, we need to find the solution to
\[x+y+z=7, x,y,z>0.\]
This gives us
\[\binom{6}{2}=15\]
ways by balls and urns
But we have counted the one with 5 digit numbers; that is, $(5,1,1),(1,1,5),(1,5,1)$.
Thus, each arrangement has\[\binom{6}{2}-3=12\]ways per arrangement, and there are $12\times35=\boxed{420}$ ways.
This can be solved quickly and easily with generating functions.
Let $x^n$ represent flipping $n$ tails.
The generating functions for these coins are $(1+x)$,$(1+x)$,and $(4+3x)$ in order.
The product is $4+11x+10x^2+3x^3$
($ax^n$ means there are $a$ ways to get $n$ heads, eg there are $10$ ways to get $2$ heads, and therefore $1$ tail, here.)
The sum of the coefficients squared (total number of possible outcomes, squared because the event is occurring twice) is $(4 + 11 + 10 + 3)^2 = 28^2 = 784$ and the sum of the squares of each coefficient (the sum of the number of ways that each coefficient can be chosen by the two people) is $4^2 + 11^2 + 10^2 + 3^2=246$
The probability is then $\frac{4^2 + 11^2 + 10^2 + 3^2}{28^2}  = \frac{246}{784} = \frac{123}{392}$
(Notice the relationship between the addends of the numerator here and the cases in the following solution.)
$123 + 392 = \boxed{515}$
Let each pair of two sets have one element in common
Label the common elements as $x$, $y$, $z$
Set $A$ will have elements $x$ and $y$, set $B$ will have $y$ and $z$, and set $C$ will have $x$ and $z$
There are $7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 = 210$ ways to choose values of $x$, $y$ and $z$
There are $4$ unpicked numbers, and each number can either go in the first set, second set, third set, or none of them
Since we have $4$ choices for each of $4$ numbers, that gives us $4^4 = 256$.
Finally, $256 \cdot 210 = 53760$, so the answer is $\boxed{760}$.
Once the two cards are drawn, there are $\dbinom{50}{2} = 1225$ ways for the other two people to draw
Alex and Dylan are the team with higher numbers if Blair and Corey both draw below $a$, which occurs in $\dbinom{a-1}{2}$ ways
Alex and Dylan are the team with lower numbers if Blair and Corey both draw above $a+9$, which occurs in $\dbinom{43-a}{2}$ ways
Thus,\[p(a)=\frac{\dbinom{43-a}{2}+\dbinom{a-1}{2}}{1225}.\]Simplifying, we get $p(a)=\frac{(43-a)(42-a)+(a-1)(a-2)}{2\cdot1225}$, so we need $(43-a)(42-a)+(a-1)(a-2)\ge (1225)$
If $a=22+b$, then\begin{align*}(43-a)(42-a)+(a-1)(a-2)&=(21-b)(20-b)+(21+b)(20+b)=2b^2+2(21)(20)\ge (1225) \\ b^2\ge \frac{385}{2} &= 192.5 >13^2 \end{align*}So $b> 13$ or $b< -13$, and $a=22+b<9$ or $a>35$, so $a=8$ or $a=36$
Thus, $p(8) = \frac{616}{1225} = \frac{88}{175}$, and the answer is $88+175 = \boxed{263}$.
There are $12 \cdot 11 = 132$ possible situations ($12$ choices for the initially assigned gate, and $11$ choices for which gate Dave's flight was changed to)
We are to count the situations in which the two gates are at most $400$ feet apart.
If we number the gates $1$ through $12$, then gates $1$ and $12$ have four other gates within $400$ feet, gates $2$ and $11$ have five, gates $3$ and $10$ have six, gates $4$ and $9$ have have seven, and gates $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$ have eight
Therefore, the number of valid gate assignments is\[2\cdot(4+5+6+7)+4\cdot8 = 2 \cdot 22 + 4 \cdot 8 = 76\]so the probability is $\frac{76}{132} = \frac{19}{33}$
The answer is $19 + 33 = \boxed{52}$.
Let us partition the set $\{1,2,\cdots,12\}$ into $n$ numbers in $A$ and $12-n$ numbers in $B$,
Since $n$ must be in $B$ and $12-n$ must be in $A$ ($n\ne6$, we cannot partition into two sets of 6 because $6$ needs to end up somewhere, $n\ne 0$ or $12$ either).
We have $\dbinom{10}{n-1}$ ways of picking the numbers to be in $A$.
So the answer is $\left(\sum_{n=1}^{11} \dbinom{10}{n-1}\right) - \dbinom{10}{5}=2^{10}-252= \boxed{772}$.
Use complementary probability and Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion
If we consider the delegates from each country to be indistinguishable and number the chairs, we have\[\frac{9!}{(3!)^3} = \frac{9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4}{6\cdot6} = 6\cdot8\cdot7\cdot5 = 30\cdot56\]total ways to seat the candidates.
Of these, there are $3 \times 9 \times \frac{6!}{(3!)^2}$ ways to have the candidates of at least some one country sit together
This comes to\[\frac{27\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4}6 = 27\cdot 20.\]
Among these there are $3 \times 9 \times 4$ ways for candidates from two countries to each sit together
This comes to $27\cdot 4.$
Finally, there are $9 \times 2 = 18.$ ways for the candidates from all the countries to sit in three blocks (9 clockwise arrangements, and 9 counter-clockwise arrangements).
So, by PIE, the total count of unwanted arrangements is $27\cdot 20 - 27\cdot 4 + 18 = 16\cdot27 + 18 = 18\cdot25.$ So the fraction\[\frac mn = \frac{30\cdot 56 - 18\cdot 25}{30\cdot 56} = \frac{56 - 15}{56} = \frac{41}{56}.\]Thus $m + n = 56 + 41 = \boxed{097}.$
Table of values of $P(x)$:
\begin{align*} P(5) &= 1 \\ P(6) &= 9 \\ P(7) &= 19 \\ P(8) &= 31 \\ P(9) &= 45 \\ P(10) &= 61 \\ P(11) &= 79 \\ P(12) &= 99 \\ P(13) &= 121 \\ P(14) &= 145 \\ P(15) &= 171 \\ \end{align*}
In order for $\lfloor \sqrt{P(x)} \rfloor = \sqrt{P(\lfloor x \rfloor)}$ to hold, $\sqrt{P(\lfloor x \rfloor)}$ must be an integer and hence $P(\lfloor x \rfloor)$ must be a perfect square
This limits $x$ to $5 \le x < 6$ or $6 \le x < 7$ or $13 \le x < 14$ since, from the table above, those are the only values of $x$ for which $P(\lfloor x \rfloor)$ is an perfect square
However, in order for $\sqrt{P(x)}$ to be rounded down to $P(\lfloor x \rfloor)$, $P(x)$ must be less than the next perfect square after $P(\lfloor x \rfloor)$ (for the said intervals)
Now, we consider the three cases:
Case $5 \le x < 6$:
$P(x)$ must be less than the first perfect square after $1$, which is $4$, i.e.:
$1 \le P(x) < 4$ (because $\lfloor \sqrt{P(x)} \rfloor = 1$ implies $1 \le \sqrt{P(x)} < 2$)
Since $P(x)$ is increasing for $x \ge 5$, we just need to find the value $v \ge 5$ where $P(v) = 4$, which will give us the working range $5 \le x < v$.
\begin{align*} v^2 - 3v - 9 &= 4 \\ v &= \frac{3 + \sqrt{61}}{2} \end{align*}
So in this case, the only values that will work are $5 \le x < \frac{3 + \sqrt{61}}{2}$.
Case $6 \le x < 7$:
$P(x)$ must be less than the first perfect square after $9$, which is $16$.
\begin{align*} v^2 - 3v - 9 &= 16 \\ v &= \frac{3 + \sqrt{109}}{2} \end{align*}
So in this case, the only values that will work are $6 \le x < \frac{3 + \sqrt{109}}{2}$.
Case $13 \le x < 14$:
$P(x)$ must be less than the first perfect square after $121$, which is $144$.
\begin{align*} v^2 - 3v - 9 &= 144 \\ v &= \frac{3 + \sqrt{621}}{2} \end{align*}
So in this case, the only values that will work are $13 \le x < \frac{3 + \sqrt{621}}{2}$.
Now, we find the length of the working intervals and divide it by the length of the total interval, $15 - 5 = 10$:
\begin{align*} \frac{\left( \frac{3 + \sqrt{61}}{2} - 5 \right) + \left( \frac{3 + \sqrt{109}}{2} - 6 \right) + \left( \frac{3 + \sqrt{621}}{2} - 13 \right)}{10} \\ &= \frac{\sqrt{61} + \sqrt{109} + \sqrt{621} - 39}{20} \end{align*}
Thus, the answer is $61 + 109 + 621 + 39 + 20 = \boxed{850}$.
Rearranging the inequality we get $d-c > b-a$
Let $e = 11$, then $(a, b-a, c-b, d-c, e-d)$ is a partition of 11 into 5 positive integers or equivalently: $(a-1, b-a-1, c-b-1, d-c-1, e-d-1)$ is a partition of 6 into 5 non-negative integer parts
Via a standard stars and bars argument, the number of ways to partition 6 into 5 non-negative parts is $\binom{6+4}4 = \binom{10}4 = 210$
The interesting quadruples correspond to partitions where the second number is less than the fourth
By symmetry, there are as many partitions where the fourth is less than the second
So, if $N$ is the number of partitions where the second element is equal to the fourth, our answer is $(210-N)/2$.
We find $N$ as a sum of 4 cases:
two parts equal to zero, $\binom82 = 28$ ways,
two parts equal to one, $\binom62 = 15$ ways,
two parts equal to two, $\binom42 = 6$ ways,
two parts equal to three, $\binom22 = 1$ way.
Therefore, $N = 28 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 50$ and our answer is $(210 - 50)/2 = \boxed{80}$.
Since the sum of the three probabilities is 1, the probability of stopping on region $C$ is $1 - \frac{1}{2} -
\frac{1}{5} = \frac{10}{10} - \frac{5}{10} - \frac{2}{10} = \boxed{\frac{3}{10}}$.
We are limited by the number of marbles whose right hand neighbor is not the same color as the marble
By surrounding every green marble with red marbles - RGRGRGRGRGR
That's 10 "not the same colors" and 0 "same colors." Now, for every red marble we add, we will add one "same color" pair and keep all 10 "not the same color" pairs
It follows that we can add 10 more red marbles for a total of $m = 16$
We can place those ten marbles in any of 6 "boxes": To the left of the first green marble, to the right of the first but left of the second, etc
up until to the right of the last
This is a stars-and-bars problem, the solution of which can be found as $\binom{n+k}{k}$ where n is the number of stars and k is the number of bars
There are 10 stars (The unassigned Rs, since each "box" must contain at least one, are not counted here) and 5 "bars," the green marbles
So the answer is $\binom{15}{5} = 3003$, take the remainder when divided by 1000 to get the answer: $\boxed{3}$.
Call a beef meal $B,$ a chicken meal $C,$ and a fish meal $F.$ Now say the nine people order meals $\text{BBBCCCFFF}$ respectively and say that the person who receives the correct meal is the first person
We will solve for this case and then multiply by $9$ to account for the $9$ different ways in which the person to receive the correct meal could be picked
Note, this implies that the dishes are indistinguishable, though the people aren't
For example, two people who order chicken are separate, though if they receive fish, there is only 1 way to order them.
The problem we must solve is to distribute meals $\text{BBCCCFFF}$ to orders $\text{BBCCCFFF}$ with no matches
The two people who ordered $B$'s can either both get $C$'s, both get $F$'s, or get one $C$ and one $F.$ We proceed with casework.
If the two $B$ people both get $C$'s, then the three $F$ meals left to distribute must all go to the $C$ people
The $F$ people then get $BBC$ in some order, which gives three possibilities
The indistinguishability is easier to see here, as we distribute the $F$ meals to the $C$ people, and there is only 1 way to order this, as all three meals are the same.
If the two $B$ people both get $F$'s, the situation is identical to the above and three possibilities arise.
If the two $B$ people get $CF$ in some order, then the $C$ people must get $FFB$ and the $F$ people must get $CCB.$ This gives $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 18$ possibilities.
Summing across the cases we see there are $24$ possibilities, so the answer is $9 \cdot 24 = \boxed{216}$.
Given that each person shakes hands with two people, we can view all of these through graph theory as 'rings'
This will split it into four cases: Three rings of three, one ring of three and one ring of six, one ring of four and one ring of five, and one ring of nine
(All other cases that sum to nine won't work, since they have at least one 'ring' of two or fewer points, which doesn't satisfy the handshaking conditions of the problem.)
Case 1: To create our groups of three, there are $\dfrac{\dbinom{9}{3}\dbinom{6}{3}\dbinom{3}{3}}{3!}$
In general, the number of ways we can arrange people within the rings to count properly is $\dfrac{(n-1)!}{2}$, since there are $(n-1)!$ ways to arrange items in the circle, and then we don't want to want to consider reflections as separate entities
Thus, each of the three cases has $\dfrac{(3-1)!}{2}=1$ arrangements
Therefore, for this case, there are $\left(\dfrac{\dbinom{9}{3}\dbinom{6}{3}\dbinom{3}{3}}{3!}\right)(1)^3=280$
Case 2: For three and six, there are $\dbinom{9}{6}=84$ sets for the rings
For organization within the ring, as before, there is only one way to arrange the ring of three
For six, there is $\dfrac{(6-1)!}{2}=60$
This means there are $(84)(1)(60)=5040$ arrangements.
Case 3: For four and five, there are $\dbinom{9}{5}=126$ sets for the rings
Within the five, there are $\dfrac{4!}{2}=12$, and within the four there are $\dfrac{3!}{2}=3$ arrangements
This means the total is $(126)(12)(3)=4536$.
Case 4: For the nine case, there is $\dbinom{9}{9}=1$ arrangement for the ring
Within it, there are $\dfrac{8!}{2}=20160$ arrangements.
Summing the cases, we have $280+5040+4536+20160=30016 \to \boxed{16}$.
There are two cases:
Case 1: One man and one woman is chosen from each department.
Case 2: Two men are chosen from one department, two women are chosen from another department, and one man and one woman are chosen from the third department.
For the first case, in each department there are ${{2}\choose{1}} \times {{2}\choose{1}} = 4$ ways to choose one man and one woman
Thus there are $4^3 = 64$ total possibilities conforming to case 1.
For the second case, there is only ${{2}\choose{2}} = 1$ way to choose two professors of the same gender from a department, and again there are $4$ ways to choose one man and one woman
Thus there are $1 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 = 4$ ways to choose two men from one department, two women from another department, and one man and one woman from the third department
However, there are $3! = 6$ different department orders, so the total number of possibilities conforming to case 2 is $4 \cdot 6 = 24$.
Summing these two values yields the final answer: $64 + 24 = \boxed{88}$.
Okay, an exercise in counting (lots of binomials to calculate!)
In base 2, the first number is $11111111$, which is the only way to choose 8 1's out of 8 spaces, or $\binom{8}{8}$
What about 9 spaces? Well, all told, there are $\binom{9}{8}=9$, which includes the first 1
Similarly, for 10 spaces, there are $\binom{10}{8}=45,$ which includes the first 9
For 11 spaces, there are $\binom{11}{8}=165$, which includes the first 45
You're getting the handle
For 12 spaces, there are $\binom{12}{8}=495$, which includes the first 165; for 13 spaces, there are $\binom{13}{8}=13 \cdot 99 > 1000$, so we now know that $N$ has exactly 13 spaces, so the $2^{12}$ digit is 1.
Now we just proceed with the other 12 spaces with 7 1's, and we're looking for the $1000-495=505th$ number
Well, $\binom{11}{7}=330$, so we know that the $2^{11}$ digit also is 1, and we're left with finding the $505-330=175th$ number with 11 spaces and 6 1's
Now $\binom{10}{6}=210,$ which is too big, but $\binom{9}{6}=84.$ Thus, the $2^9$ digit is 1, and we're now looking for the $175-84=91st$ number with 9 spaces and 5 1's
Continuing the same process, $\binom{8}{5}=56$, so the $2^8$ digit is 1, and we're left to look for the $91-56=35th$ number with 8 spaces and 4 1's
But here $\binom{7}{4}=35$, so N must be the last or largest 7-digit number with 4 1's
Thus the last 8 digits of $N$ must be $01111000$, and to summarize, $N=1101101111000$ in base $2$
Therefore, $N = 8+16+32+64+256+512+2048+4096 \equiv 32 \pmod{1000}$, and the answer is $\boxed{32}$.
The total ways the textbooks can be arranged in the 3 boxes is $12\textbf{C}3\cdot 9\textbf{C}4$, which is equivalent to $\frac{12\cdot 11\cdot 10\cdot 9\cdot 8\cdot 7\cdot 6}{144}=12\cdot11\cdot10\cdot7\cdot3$
If all of the math textbooks are put into the box that can hold $3$ textbooks, there are $9!/(4!\cdot 5!)=9\textbf{C}4$ ways for the other textbooks to be arranged
If all of the math textbooks are put into the box that can hold $4$ textbooks, there are $9$ ways to choose the other book in that box, times $8\textbf{C}3$ ways for the other books to be arranged
If all of the math textbooks are put into the box with the capability of holding $5$ textbooks, there are $9\textbf{C}2$ ways to choose the other 2 textbooks in that box, times $7\textbf{C}3$ ways to arrange the other 7 textbooks
$9\textbf{C}4=9\cdot7\cdot2=126$, $9\cdot 8\textbf{C}3=9\cdot8\cdot7=504$, and $9\textbf{C}2\cdot 7\textbf{C}3=9\cdot7\cdot5\cdot4=1260$, so the total number of ways the math textbooks can all be placed into the same box is $126+504+1260=1890$
So, the probability of this occurring is $\frac{(9\cdot7)(2+8+(4\cdot5))}{12\cdot11\cdot10\cdot7\cdot3}=\frac{1890}{27720}$
If the numerator and denominator are both divided by $9\cdot7$, we have $\frac{(2+8+(4\cdot5))}{4\cdot11\cdot10}=\frac{30}{440}$
Simplifying the numerator yields $\frac{30}{10\cdot4\cdot11}$, and dividing both numerator and denominator by $10$ results in $\frac{3}{44}$
This fraction cannot be simplified any further, so $m=3$ and $n=44$
Therefore, $m+n=3+44=\boxed{47}$.
Any such function can be constructed by distributing the elements of $A$ on three tiers.
The bottom tier contains the constant value, $c=f(f(x))$ for any $x$
(Obviously $f(c)=c$.)
The middle tier contains $k$ elements $x\ne c$ such that $f(x)=c$, where $1\le k\le 6$.
The top tier contains $6-k$ elements such that $f(x)$ equals an element on the middle tier.
There are $7$ choices for $c$
Then for a given $k$, there are $\tbinom6k$ ways to choose the elements on the middle tier, and then $k^{6-k}$ ways to draw arrows down from elements on the top tier to elements on the middle tier.
Thus $N=7\cdot\sum_{k=1}^6\tbinom6k\cdot k^{6-k}=7399$, giving the answer $\boxed{399}$.
Firstly, we consider how many different ways possible to divide the $7\times 1$ board
We ignore the cases of 1 or 2 pieces since we need at least one tile of each color.
Three pieces: $5+1+1$, $4+2+1$, $4+1+2$, etc, $\dbinom{6}{2}=15$ ways in total (just apply stars and bars here)
Four pieces: $\dbinom{6}{3}=20$
Five pieces: $\dbinom{6}{4}=15$
Six pieces: $\dbinom{6}{5}=6$
Seven pieces: $\dbinom{6}{6}=1$
Secondly, we use Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to consider how many ways to color them:
Three pieces: $3^3-3\times 2^3+3=6$
Four pieces: $3^4-3\times 2^4+3=36$
Five pieces: $3^5-3\times 2^5+3=150$
Six pieces: $3^6-3\times 2^6+3=540$
Seven pieces: $3^7-3\times 2^7+3=1806$
Finally, we combine them together: $15\times 6+20\times 36+15\times 150+6\times 540+1\times 1806= 8106$.
So the answer is $\boxed{106}$.
Label the left shoes be $L_1,\dots, L_{10}$ and the right shoes $R_1,\dots, R_{10}$
Notice that there are $10!$ possible pairings.
Let a pairing be "bad" if it violates the stated condition
We would like a better condition to determine if a given pairing is bad.
Note that, in order to have a bad pairing, there must exist a collection of $k<5$ pairs that includes both the left and the right shoes of $k$ adults; in other words, it is bad if it is possible to pick $k$ pairs and properly redistribute all of its shoes to exactly $k$ people.
Thus, if a left shoe is a part of a bad collection, its corresponding right shoe must also be in the bad collection (and vice versa)
To search for bad collections, we can start at an arbitrary right shoe (say $R_1$), check the left shoe it is paired with (say $L_i$), and from the previous observation, we know that $R_i$ must also be in the bad collection
Then we may check the left shoe paired with $R_i$, find its counterpart, check its left pair, find its counterpart, etc
until we have found $L_1$
We can imagine each right shoe "sending" us to another right shoe (via its paired left shoe) until we reach the starting right shoe, at which point we know that we have found a bad collection if we have done this less than $5$ times.
Effectively we have just traversed a cycle
(Note: This is the cycle notation of permutations.) The only condition for a bad pairing is that there is a cycle with length less than $5$; thus, we need to count pairings where every cycle has length at least $5$
This is only possible if there is a single cycle of length $10$ or two cycles of length $5$.
The first case yields $9!$ working pairings
The second case yields $\frac{{10\choose 5}}{2}\cdot{4!}^2=\frac{10!}{2 \cdot {5!}^2} \cdot {4!}^2$ pairings
Therefore, taking these cases out of a total of $10!$, the probability is $\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{50} = \frac{3}{25}$, for an answer of $\boxed{28}$.
We first assume a population of $100$ to facilitate solving
Then we simply organize the statistics given into a Venn diagram.
[asy]  pair A,B,C,D,E,F,G; A=(0,55); B=(60,55); C=(60,0); D=(0,0); draw(A--B--C--D--A); E=(30,35); F=(20,20); G=(40,20); draw(circle(E,15)); draw(circle(F,15)); draw(circle(G,15));  draw("$A$",(30,52)); draw("$B$",(7,7)); draw("$C$",(53,7));  draw("100",(5,60)); draw("10",(30,40)); draw("10",(15,15)); draw("10",(45,15));  draw("14",(30,16)); draw("14",(38,29)); draw("14",(22,29));  draw("$x$",(30,25)); draw("$y$",(10,45));  [/asy]
Let $x$ be the number of men with all three risk factors
Since "the probability that a randomly selected man has all three risk factors, given that he has A and B is $\frac{1}{3}$," we can tell that $x = \frac{1}{3}(x+14)$, since there are $x$ people with all three factors and 14 with only A and B
Thus $x=7$.
Let $y$ be the number of men with no risk factors
It now follows that\[y= 100 - 3 \cdot 10 - 3 \cdot 14 - 7 = 21.\]The number of men with risk factor A is $10+2 \cdot 14+7 = 45$ (10 with only A, 28 with A and one of the others, and 7 with all three)
Thus the number of men without risk factor $A$ is 55, so the desired conditional probability is $21/55$
So the answer is $21+55=\boxed{76}$.
The point $(x,y)$ satisfies $x < y$ if and only if it belongs to the shaded triangle bounded by the lines $x=y$, $y=1$, and $x=0$, the area of which is 1/2
The ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the  rectangle is $\frac{1/2}{4} = \boxed{\frac{1}{8}}$.

The probability that he rolls a six twice when using the fair die is $\frac{1}{6}\times \frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{36}$
The probability that he rolls a six twice using the biased die is $\frac{2}{3}\times \frac{2}{3}=\frac{4}{9}=\frac{16}{36}$
Given that Charles rolled two sixes, we can see that it is $16$ times more likely that he chose the second die
Therefore the probability that he is using the fair die is $\frac{1}{17}$, and the probability that he is using the biased die is $\frac{16}{17}$
The probability of rolling a third six is
\[\frac{1}{17}\times \frac{1}{6} + \frac{16}{17} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{102}+\frac{32}{51}=\frac{65}{102}\]Therefore, our desired $p+q$ is $65+102= \boxed{167}$
We know that a subset with less than $3$ chairs cannot contain $3$ adjacent chairs
There are only $10$ sets of $3$ chairs so that they are all $3$ adjacent
There are $10$ subsets of $4$ chairs where all $4$ are adjacent, and $10 \cdot 5$ or $50$ where there are only $3.$ If there are $5$ chairs, $10$ have all $5$ adjacent, $10 \cdot 4$ or $40$ have $4$ adjacent, and $10 \cdot {5\choose 2}$ or $100$ have $3$ adjacent
With $6$ chairs in the subset, $10$ have all $6$ adjacent, $10(3)$ or $30$ have $5$ adjacent, $10 \cdot {4\choose2}$ or $60$ have $4$ adjacent, $\frac{10 \cdot 3}{2}$ or $15$ have $2$ groups of $3$ adjacent chairs, and $10 \cdot \left({5\choose2} - 3\right)$ or $70$ have $1$ group of $3$ adjacent chairs
All possible subsets with more than $6$ chairs have at least $1$ group of $3$ adjacent chairs, so we add ${10\choose7}$ or $120$, ${10\choose8}$ or $45$, ${10\choose9}$ or $10$, and ${10\choose10}$ or $1.$ Adding, we get $10 + 10 + 50 + 10 + 40 + 100 + 10 + 30 + 60 + 15 + 70 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 = \boxed{581}.$
Let $a_1=x, a_2=y, a_3=z$
First note that if any absolute value equals 0, then $a_n=0$
Also note that if at any position, $a_n=a_{n-1}$, then $a_{n+2}=0$
Then, if any absolute value equals 1, then $a_n=0$
Therefore, if either $|y-x|$ or $|z-y|$ is less than or equal to 1, then that ordered triple meets the criteria
Assume that to be the only way the criteria is met
To prove, let $|y-x|>1$, and $|z-y|>1$
Then, $a_4 \ge 2z$, $a_5 \ge 4z$, and $a_6 \ge 4z$
However, since the minimum values of $a_5$ and $a_6$ are equal, there must be a scenario where the criteria was met that does not meet our earlier scenarios
Calculation shows that to be $z=1$, $|y-x|=2$
Again assume that any other scenario will not meet criteria
To prove, divide the other scenarios into two cases: $z>1$, $|y-x|>1$, and $|z-y|>1$; and $z=1$, $|y-x|>2$, and $|z-y|>1$
For the first one, $a_4 \ge 2z$, $a_5 \ge 4z$, $a_6 \ge 8z$, and $a_7 \ge 16z$, by which point we see that this function diverges
For the second one, $a_4 \ge 3$, $a_5 \ge 6$, $a_6 \ge 18$, and $a_7 \ge 54$, by which point we see that this function diverges.
Therefore, the only scenarios where $a_n=0$ is when any of the following are met: $|y-x|<2$ (280 options) $|z-y|<2$ (280 options, 80 of which coincide with option 1) $z=1$, $|y-x|=2$
(16 options, 2 of which coincide with either option 1 or option 2) Adding the total number of such ordered triples yields $280+280-80+16-2=\boxed{494}$.
First, we find the probability both are green, then the probability both are blue, and add the two probabilities
The sum should be equal to $0.58$.
The probability both are green is $\frac{4}{10}\cdot\frac{16}{16+N}$, and the probability both are blue is $\frac{6}{10}\cdot\frac{N}{16+N}$, so\[\frac{4}{10}\cdot\frac{16}{16+N}+\frac{6}{10}\cdot\frac{N}{16+N}=\frac{29}{50}\]Solving this equation,\[20\left(\frac{16}{16+N}\right)+30\left(\frac{N}{16+N}\right)=29\]Multiplying both sides by $16+N$, we get\[20\cdot 16 + 30\cdot N = 29(16+n)\Rightarrow 320+30N=464+29N \Rightarrow N = \boxed{144}\]
One could recursively compute the probabilities of reaching $(0,0)$ as the first axes point from any point $(x,y)$ as\[P(x,y) = \frac{1}{3} P(x-1,y) + \frac{1}{3} P(x,y-1) + \frac{1}{3} P(x-1,y-1)\]for $x,y \geq 1,$ and the base cases are $P(0,0) = 1, P(x,0) = P(y,0) = 0$ for any $x,y$ not equal to zero
We then recursively find $P(4,4) = \frac{245}{2187}$ so the answer is $245 + 7 = \boxed{252}$.
Let there be $T$ teams
For each team, there are ${n-5\choose 4}$ different subsets of $9$ players including that full team, so the total number of team-(group of 9) pairs is
\[T{n-5\choose 4}.\]
Thus, the expected value of the number of full teams in a random set of $9$ players is
\[\frac{T{n-5\choose 4}}{{n\choose 9}}.\]
Similarly, the expected value of the number of full teams in a random set of $8$ players is
\[\frac{T{n-5\choose 3}}{{n\choose 8}}.\]
The condition is thus equivalent to the existence of a positive integer $T$ such that
\[\frac{T{n-5\choose 4}}{{n\choose 9}}\frac{T{n-5\choose 3}}{{n\choose 8}} = 1.\]
\[T^2\frac{(n-5)!(n-5)!8!9!(n-8)!(n-9)!}{n!n!(n-8)!(n-9)!3!4!} = 1\]
\[T^2 = \big((n)(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)\big)^2 \frac{3!4!}{8!9!}\]
\[T^2 = \big((n)(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)\big)^2 \frac{144}{7!7!8\cdot8\cdot9}\]
\[T^2 = \big((n)(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)\big)^2 \frac{1}{4\cdot7!7!}\]
\[T = \frac{(n)(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)}{2^5\cdot3^2\cdot5\cdot7}\]
Note that this is always less than ${n\choose 5}$, so as long as $T$ is integral, $n$ is a possibility
Thus, we have that this is equivalent to
\[2^5\cdot3^2\cdot5\cdot7\big|(n)(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4).\]
It is obvious that $5$ divides the RHS, and that $7$ does iff $n\equiv 0,1,2,3,4\mod 7$
Also, $3^2$ divides it iff $n\not\equiv 5,8\mod 9$
One can also bash out that $2^5$ divides it in $16$ out of the $32$ possible residues $\mod 32$.
Using all numbers from $2$ to $2017$, inclusive, it is clear that each possible residue $\mod 7,9,32$ is reached an equal number of times, so the total number of working $n$ in that range is $5\cdot 7\cdot 16 = 560$
However, we must subtract the number of "working" $2\leq n\leq 8$, which is $3$
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{557}$.
There are 81 multiples of 11
Some have digits repeated twice, making 3 permutations.
Others that have no repeated digits have 6 permutations, but switching the hundreds and units digits also yield a multiple of 11
Therefore, assign 3 permutations to each multiple.
There are now 81*3 = 243 permutations, but we have overcounted*
Some multiples of 11 have a zero, and we must subtract a permutation for each.
There are 110, 220, 330 ..
990, yielding 9 extra permutations
Also, there are 209, 308, 407...902, yielding 8 more permutations.
Now, just subtract these 17 from the total (243), getting $\boxed{226}$.
We can solve this by finding all the combinations, then subtracting the ones that are on the same line
There are $25$ points in all, from $(1,1)$ to $(5,5)$, so $\dbinom{25}3$ is $\frac{25\cdot 24\cdot 23}{3\cdot 2 \cdot 1}$, which simplifies to $2300$
Now we count the ones that are on the same line
We see that any three points chosen from $(1,1)$ and $(1,5)$ would be on the same line, so $\dbinom53$ is $10$, and there are $5$ rows, $5$ columns, and $2$ long diagonals, so that results in $120$
We can also count the ones with $4$ on a diagonal
That is $\dbinom43$, which is 4, and there are $4$ of those diagonals, so that results in $16$
We can count the ones with only $3$ on a diagonal, and there are $4$ diagonals like that, so that results in $4$
We can also count the ones with a slope of $\frac12$, $2$, $-\frac12$, or $-2$, with $3$ points in each
There are $12$ of them, so that results in $12$
Finally, we subtract all the ones in a line from $2300$, so we have $2300-120-16-4-12=\boxed{2148}$.
Draw a $7 \times 7$ square.
$\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline K & J & H & G & H & J & K \\ \hline J & F & E & D & E & F & J \\ \hline H & E & C & B & C & E & H \\ \hline G & D & B & A & B & D & G \\ \hline H & E & C & B & C & E & H \\ \hline J & F & E & D & E & F & J \\ \hline K & J & H & G & H & J & K \\ \hline \end{tabular}$
Start from the center and label all protruding cells symmetrically
(Note that "I" is left out of this labelling, so there are only 10 labels, not 11, as ending in K would suggest!)
More specifically, since there are $4$ given lines of symmetry ($2$ diagonals, $1$ vertical, $1$ horizontal) and they split the plot into $8$ equivalent sections, we can take just one-eighth and study it in particular
Each of these sections has $10$ distinct sub-squares, whether partially or in full
So since each can be colored either white or black, we choose $2^{10}=1024$ but then subtract the $2$ cases where all are white or all are black
That leaves us with $\boxed{1022}$.
There are $\binom{20}{2}$ pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 20, and there are $\binom{8}{2}$ pairs of distinct prime numbers between 1 and 20
Therefore, the probability that both members of a randomly chosen pair are prime is $\dfrac{\binom{8}{2}}{\binom{20}{2}}=\dfrac{8(7)/2}{20(19)/2}=\boxed{\dfrac{14}{95}}$.
Suppose our polynomial is equal to\[ax^3+bx^2+cx+d\]Then we are given that\[-9=b+d-a-c.\]If we let $-a=a'-9, -c=c'-9$ then we have\[9=a'+c'+b+d.\]This way all four variables are within 0 and 9
The number of solutions to this equation is simply $\binom{12}{3}=\boxed{220}$ by stars and bars.
As with solution $1$ we would like to note that given any quadrilateral we can change its angles to make a cyclic one.
Let $a \ge b \ge c\ge d$ be the sides of the quadrilateral.
There are $\binom{31}{3}$ ways to partition $32$
However, some of these will not be quadrilaterals since they would have one side bigger than the sum of the other three
This occurs when $a \ge 16$
For $a=16$, $b+c+d=16$
There are $\binom{15}{2}$ ways to partition $16$
Since $a$ could be any of the four sides, we have counted $4\binom{15}{2}$ degenerate quadrilaterals
Similarly, there are $4\binom{14}{2}$, $4\binom{13}{2} \cdots 4\binom{2}{2}$ for other values of $a$
Thus, there are $\binom{31}{3} - 4\left(\binom{15}{2}+\binom{14}{2}+\cdots+\binom{2}{2}\right) = \binom{31}{3} - 4\binom{16}{3} = 2255$ non-degenerate partitions of $32$ by the hockey stick theorem
We then account for symmetry
If all sides are congruent (meaning the quadrilateral is a square), the quadrilateral will be counted once
If the quadrilateral is a rectangle (and not a square), it will be counted twice
In all other cases, it will be counted 4 times
Since there is $1$ square case, and $7$ rectangle cases, there are $2255-1-2\cdot7=2240$ quadrilaterals counted 4 times
Thus there are $1+7+\frac{2240}{4} = \boxed{568}$ total quadrilaterals.
This question can be solved fairly directly by casework and pattern-finding
We give a somewhat more general attack, based on the solution to the following problem:
How many ways are there to choose $k$ elements from an ordered $n$ element set without choosing two consecutive members?
You want to choose $k$ numbers out of $n$ with no consecutive numbers
For each configuration, we can subtract $i-1$ from the $i$-th element in your subset
This converts your configuration into a configuration with $k$ elements where the largest possible element is $n-k+1$, with no restriction on consecutive numbers
Since this process is easily reversible, we have a bijection
Without consideration of the second condition, we have: ${15 \choose 1} + {14 \choose 2} + {13 \choose 3} + ..
+ {9 \choose 7} + {8 \choose 8}$
Now we examine the second condition
It simply states that no element in our original configuration (and hence also the modified configuration, since we don't move the smallest element) can be less than $k$, which translates to subtracting $k - 1$ from the "top" of each binomial coefficient
Now we have, after we cancel all the terms ${n \choose k}$ where $n < k$, ${15 \choose 1} + {13 \choose 2} + {11 \choose 3} + {9 \choose 4} + {7 \choose 5}=  15 + 78 + 165 + 126 + 21 = \boxed{405}$
Since the octahedron is indistinguishable by rotations, without loss of generality fix a face to be red.

There are $7!$ ways to arrange the remaining seven colors, but there still are three possible rotations about the fixed face, so the answer is $7!/3 = \boxed{1680}$.

The vertices of the triangles are limited to a $4\times4$ grid, with $16$ points total
Every triangle is determined by $3$ points chosen from these $16$ for a total of $\binom{16}{3}=560$
However, triangles formed by collinear points do not have positive area
For each column or row, there are $\binom{4}{3}=4$ such degenerate triangles
There are $8$ total columns and rows, contributing $32$ invalid triangles
There are also $4$ for both of the diagonals and $1$ for each of the $4$ shorter diagonals
There are a total of $32+8+4=44$ invalid triangles counted in the $560$, so the answer is $560-44=\boxed{516}$.
We approach this problem using Linearity of Expectation
Consider a pair of two people standing next to each other
Ignoring all other people, the probability that a boy is standing on the left position and a girl is standing on the right position is $\frac7{20}\cdot\frac{13}{19}$
Similarly, if a girl is standing on the left position and a boy is standing on the right position the probability is also $\frac{7\cdot 13}{20\cdot 19}$
Thus, the total probability of the two people being one boy and one girl is $\frac{91}{190}$.
There are a total of 19 different adjacent pairs, so by Linearity of Expectation, we have that the expected value of $S$ is $\frac{91}{10}$ so $\boxed{9}$.
By the Binomial Theorem, $(1+i)^{99}=\sum_{n=0}^{99}\binom{99}{j}i^n =$ $\binom{99}{0}i^0+\binom{99}{1}i^1+\binom{99}{2}i^2+\binom{99}{3}i^3+\binom{99}{4}i^4+\cdots +\binom{99}{98}i^{98}$.
Using the fact that $i^1=i$, $i^2=-1$, $i^3=-i$, $i^4=1$, and $i^{n+4}=i^n$, the sum becomes:
$(1+i)^{99}=\binom{99}{0}+\binom{99}{1}i-\binom{99}{2}-\binom{99}{3}i+\binom{99}{4}+\cdots -\binom{99}{98}$.
So, $Re[(1+i)^{99}]=\binom{99}{0}-\binom{99}{2}+\binom{99}{4}-\cdots -\binom{99}{98} = S$.
Using De Moivre's Theorem, $(1+i)^{99}=[\sqrt{2}cis(45^\circ)]^{99}=\sqrt{2^{99}}\cdot cis(99\cdot45^\circ)=2^{49}\sqrt{2}\cdot cis(135^\circ) = -2^{49}+2^{49}i$.
And finally, $S=Re[-2^{49}+2^{49}i] = \boxed{-2^{49}}$.
The scores of all ten runners must sum to $55$
So a winning score is anything between $1+2+3+4+5=15$ and $\lfloor\tfrac{55}{2}\rfloor=27$ inclusive
It is easy to check that this range is covered by considering $1+2+3+4+x$, $1+2+3+x+10$ and $1+2+x+9+10$, so the answer is $\boxed{13}$.
Suppose there are more men than women; then there are between zero and two women.
If there are no women, the pair is $(0,5)$
If there is one woman, the pair is $(2,5)$.
If there are two women, there are two arrangements: one in which they are together, and one in which they are apart, giving the pairs $(4,5)$ and $(3,5)$.
All four pairs are asymmetrical; therefore by symmetry there are $\boxed{8}$ pairs altogether.
The process of choosing a block can be represented by a generating function
Each choice we make can match the 'plastic medium red circle' in one of its qualities $(1)$ or differ from it in $k$ different ways $(kx)$
Choosing the material is represented by the factor $(1+1x)$, choosing the size by the factor $(1+2x)$, etc:\[(1+x)(1+2x)(1+3x)^2\]Expanding out the first two factors and the square:\[(1+3x+2x^2)(1+6x+9x^2)\]By expanding further we can find the coefficient of $x^2$, which represents the number of blocks differing from the original block in exactly two ways
We don't have to expand it completely, but choose the terms which will be multiplied together to result in a constant multiple of $x^2$:\[1\cdot9+3\cdot6+2\cdot1=\boxed{29}\]
We have $2$ choices for who wins the first game, and that uniquely determines $5^{\text{th}}$ place
Then there are $2$ choices for a next game and that uniquely determines $4^{\text{th}}$ place, followed by $2$ choices for the next game that uniquely determines $3^{\text{rd}}$ place
Finally, there are $2$ choices for the last game, which uniquely determines both $1^{\text{st}}$ and $2^{\text{nd}}$ places, since the winner is $1^{\text{st}}$ and the loser is $2^{\text{nd}}$
Thus the number of possible orders is $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = \boxed{16}$.
The total number of ways to choose 6 numbers is ${10\choose 6} = 210$.
Assume $3$ is the second-lowest number
There are $5$ numbers left to choose, $4$ of which must be greater than $3$, and $1$ of which must be less than $3$
This is equivalent to choosing $4$ numbers from the $7$ numbers larger than $3$, and $1$ number from the $2$ numbers less than $3$.\[{7\choose 4} {2\choose 1}= 35\times2\].
Thus, $\frac{35\times2}{210} = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
Suppose that you wish to draw one pair of socks from the drawer
Then you would pick $5$ socks (one of each kind, plus one)
Notice that in the worst possible situation, you will continue to draw the same sock, until you get $10$ pairs
This is because drawing the same sock results in a pair every $2$ of that sock, whereas drawing another sock creates another pair
Thus the answer is $5+2\cdot(10-1) = \boxed{23}$.
We will solve this problem by constructing a recursion satisfied by $\mathcal{S}_n$.
Let $A_1(n)$ be the number of such strings of length $n$ ending in 1, $A_2(n)$ be the number of such strings of length $n$ ending in a single 0 and $A_3(n)$ be the number of such strings of length $n$ ending in a double zero
Then $A_1(1) = 1, A_2(1) = 1, A_3(1) = 0, A_1(2) = 2, A_2(2) = 1$ and $A_3(2) = 1$.
Note that $\mathcal{S}_n = A_1(n) + A_2(n) + A_3(n)$
For $n \geq 2$ we have $A_1(n) = \mathcal{S}_{n - 1} = A_1(n - 1) + A_2(n - 1) + A_3(n - 1)$ (since we may add a 1 to the end of any valid string of length $n - 1$ to get a valid string of length $n$), $A_2(n) = A_1(n -1)$ (since every valid string ending in 10 can be arrived at by adding a 0 to a string ending in 1) and $A_3(n) = A_2(n - 1)$ (since every valid string ending in 100 can be arrived at by adding a 0 to a string ending in 10).
Thus $\mathcal{S}_n = A_1(n) + A_2(n) + A_3(n) = \mathcal{S}_{n - 1} + A_1(n - 1) + A_2(n - 1) = \mathcal{S}_{n -1} + \mathcal{S}_{n - 2} + A_1(n - 2) = \mathcal{S}_{n - 1} + \mathcal{S}_{n -2} + \mathcal{S}_{n - 3}$
Then using the initial values $\mathcal{S}_1 = 2, \mathcal{S}_2 = 4, \mathcal{S}_3 = 7$ we can easily compute that $\mathcal{S}_{11} = \boxed{927}$.
Equivalently, we need to place 12 indistinguishable balls into 7 distinguishable boxes so that no box contains more than 9 balls
There are ${12 + 7 - 1 \choose 7 - 1} = {18 \choose 6} = 18,564$ ways to place 12 objects into 7 boxes
Of these, 7 place all 12 into a single box
$7 \cdot 6 = 42$ place 11 in one box and 1 in a second
$7 \cdot 6 = 42$ place 10 into one box and 2 into a second
$7 \cdot \frac{6\cdot 5}{2} = 105$ place 10 into one box and 1 into each of two others
Thus, this gives us $m = 18564 - 7 - 42 - 42 - 105 = 18368$ so $\star(m) = 1 + 8 + 3 + 6 + 8 = \boxed{26}$.
We use casework:
Alpha purchases $3$ items, Beta $0$
Then there are ${8\choose 3} = 56$ ways for Alpha to pick $3$ different items.
Alpha purchases $2$ items, Beta $1$
Then there are ${8\choose 2} = 28$ ways for Alpha to pick $2$ different items and there are $5$ ways for Beta to choose her oreo, with a total of $28 \cdot 5 = 140$.
Alpha purchases $1$ items, Beta $2$
Then there are $8$ ways for Alpha to pick $1$ different items
There are ${5\choose 2} = 10$ ways for Beta to choose two distinct oreos, and $5$ ways for Beta to choose two oreos of the same flavor
This totals to $8 \cdot (10+5) = 120$.
Alpha purchases $0$ items, Beta $3$
There are ${5\choose 3} = 10$ ways for Beta to choose three distinct oreos
For Beta to choose two oreos of the same flavor and another oreo, there are $5$ choices for the first and $4$ choices for the second, with a total of $20$ choices
There are $5$ ways to choose three of the same flavored oreo
This totals to $10 + 20 + 5 = 35$.
The total is $56 + 140 + 120 + 35 = \boxed{351}$.
We apply the complement principle: we find the total number of cases in which the 2 green places are adjacent, and subtract from the total number of cases.
There are $\frac{10!}{5!2!2!1!} = 7560$ ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion
However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, there are $10$ ways to rotate the plates, and so there are $7560/10 = 756$ ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion (consider, for example, fixing the orange plate at the top of the table).
If the two green plates are adjacent, we may think of them as a single entity, so that there are now $9$ objects to be placed around the table in a circular fashion
Using the same argument, there are $\frac{9!}{5!2!1!1!} = 1512$ ways to arrange the objects in a linear fashion, and $1512/9 = 168$ ways in a circular fashion.
Thus, the answer is $756 - 168 = \boxed{588}$.
Let $a_n$ denote the number of sequences of length $n$ that do not contain consecutive $1$s
A sequence of length $n$ must either end in a $0$ or a $1$
If the string of length $n$ ends in a $0$, this string could have been formed by appending a $0$ to any sequence of length $n-1$, of which there are $a_{n-1}$ such strings
If the string of length $n$ ends in a $1$, this string could have been formed by appending a $01$ (to avoid consecutive $1$s) to any sequence of length $n-2$, of which there are $a_{n-2}$ such strings
Thus, we have the recursion\[a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\]Solving for initial conditions, we find $a_1 = 2, a_2 = 3$
Thus we have the Fibonacci sequence with shifted indices; indeed $a_n = F_{n+2}$, so $a_{10} = F_{12} = 144$
The probability is $\frac{144}{2^{10}} = \frac{9}{64}$, and $m+n=\boxed{73}$.
We can find a recursion
Let $D_n$ be the number of legal delivery sequences for $n$ houses
If a sequence ends with a delivery, we simply append one to $D_{n - 1}$
If it ends in $1$ nondelivery, we append a nondelivery and a delivery to $D_{n - 2}$
If it ends in $2$ nondeliveries, we append them and a delivery to $D_{n - 3}$
$D_n = D_{n - 1} + D_{n - 2} + D_{n - 3}$.
Thus, since clearly $D_1 = 2$, $D_2 = 4$, $D_3 = 7$, we have $D_4 = 13$, $D_5 = 24$, $D_6 = 44$, $D_7 = 81$, $D_8 = 149$, $D_9 = 274$, $D_{10} = \boxed{504}$.
Let there be $k$ As amongst the five numbers in the middle (those mentioned in condition [2])
There are $4-k$ As amongst the last six numbers then
Also, there are $5-k$ Cs amongst the middle five numbers, and so there are $6-(5-k) = k+1$ Cs amongst the first four numbers.
Thus, there are ${4 \choose k+1}$ ways to arrange the first four numbers, ${5 \choose k}$ ways to arrange the middle five numbers, and ${6 \choose 4-k} = {6\choose k+2}$ ways to arrange the last six numbers
Notice that $k=4$ leads to a contradiction, so the desired sum is\[\sum_{k=0}^{3} {4\choose k+1}{5\choose k}{6\choose k+2} = 60 + 600 + 600 + 60 = 1320\]And $N \equiv \boxed{320} \pmod{1000}$.
Note that a $7$ digit increasing integer is determined once we select a set of $7$ digits
To determine the number of sets of $7$ digits, consider $9$ urns labeled $1,2,\cdots,9$ (note that $0$ is not a permissible digit); then we wish to drop $7$ balls into these urns
Using the ball-and-urn argument, having $9$ urns is equivalent to $8$ dividers, and there are ${8 + 7 \choose 7} = {15 \choose 7} = 6435 \equiv \boxed{435} \pmod{1000}$.
It is clear that his list begins with 1 one-digit integer, 10 two-digits integers, and 100 three-digit integers, making a total of $321$ digits.
So he needs another $1000-321=679$ digits before he stops
He can accomplish this by writing 169 four-digit numbers for a total of $321+4(169)=997$ digits
The last of these 169 four-digit numbers is 1168, so the next three digits will be $\boxed{116}$.
We take as our universe the set of 10-digit integers whose digits are all either 1 or 2, of which there are $2^{10}$, and we count the complement
The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s
Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.
There are two "good" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22)
Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing "2" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing "21" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number
This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers
Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers
The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.
Thus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \boxed{880}$.
The numbers $a_i - i$ are ten not-necessarily distinct even elements of the set $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 1997\}$
Moreover, given ten not-necessarily distinct elements of $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 1997\}$, we can reconstruct the list $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{10}$ in exactly one way, by adding 1 to the smallest, then adding 2 to the second-smallest (which might actually be equal to the smallest), and so on.
Thus, the answer is the same as the number of ways to choose 10 elements with replacement from the set $\{0, 2, 4, \ldots, 1996\}$, which has 999 elements
This is a classic problem of combinatorics; in general, there are ${m + n - 1 \choose m}$ ways to choose $m$ things from a set of $n$ with replacement
In our case, this gives the value of ${999 + 10 - 1 \choose 10} = {1008 \choose 10}$, so the answer is $\boxed{8}$.
Florida issues license plates in which the first three and last slots are filled with letters, and the fourth and fifth are filled with digits
Thus, there are $26^4 \cdot 10^2$ Florida license plates possible
North Dakota, however, issues license plates in which the first three slots are filled with letters and the last three slots are filled with digits
There are thus $26^3 \cdot 10^3$ possible North Dakota license plates
Multiplying these out and taking the difference yields an answer of $\boxed{28121600}$.
Let's deal with the restriction first.
The restriction is that we have to place a math book on both ends
We have 3 choices for the math book to place on the left end, and then 2 choices for the math book to place on the right end.
Then we simply need to arrange the other 6 books in the middle
This is a basic permutation problem, so there are $6!$ ways to arrange the 6 remaining books.
So there are a total of $3 \times 2 \times 6! = \boxed{4,\!320}$ ways to arrange the books on the bookshelf.
This problem can be solved by the quick observation that $3! = 6$, and so $5! \cdot 6 = 6!$
So $n=\boxed{6}$.
To have a zero at the end of a number means that the number is divisible by $10$
$10 = 2\cdot 5$
Thus, in our multiplication, we want to pair twos and fives
Every other number is divisible by two, every fourth number is divisible by four, etc
This means that we have many more factors of two than of fives, so we just want to count the number of fives that we have available to pair with twos
$\frac{25}{5} = 5$, so we know that we have $5$ fives (one for $5$, one for $10$, one for $15$, and so on)
However, $25 = 5\cdot 5$, so we have one more five to count
Thus, we have six fives which we can pair with twos, giving us a final answer of $\boxed{6}$ zeros at the end of the number.
We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting
That is, if we had 5 distinct digits, there would be $5! = 120$ orderings
However, we must divide by 3! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digits were different then we could rearrange them in that many ways)
So, our answer is $\frac{5!}{3!\cdot 2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = \boxed{10}$.
$43$ appears in the $43$rd row of Pascal's Triangle, since $\binom{43}{1} = 43$
Note that $43$ is prime, so the smallest integer $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by $43$ is actually $43$
Therefore, the $43$rd row is the first row in which $43$ appears
Also note that all the other numbers in the $43$rd row are greater than $43$, with the exception of the $1$'s on the ends
As a result, all the numbers on the following rows will either be $1$ or greater than $43$, so $43$ only appears in the $43$rd row
Therefore, only $\boxed{1}$ row of Pascal's Triangle contains the number $43$.
The dot is chosen from the face with $n$ dots with probability $\frac{n}{21}$
Thus the face that originally has $n$ dots is left with an odd number of dots with probability $\frac{n}{21}$ if $n$ is even and $1 - n/21$ if $n$ is odd
Each face is the top face with probability $\frac{1}{6}$
Therefore the top face has an odd number of dots with probability \begin{align*}
&\frac{1}{6}\displaystyle\left(\displaystyle\left(1 - \frac{1}{21}\displaystyle\right) + \frac{2}{21} + \displaystyle\left(1 - \frac{3}{21}\displaystyle\right)
+ \frac{4}{21} + \displaystyle\left(1 - \frac{5}{21}\displaystyle\right) + \frac{6}{21}\displaystyle\right) \\
& \qquad = \frac{1}{6} \displaystyle\left(3 + \frac{3}{21}\displaystyle\right)\\
& \qquad = \frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{66}{21} \\
& \qquad = \boxed{\frac{11}{21}}.
\end{align*}
We can use the idea of complementary probability to solve this problem without too much nasty casework
The probability that the committee has at least 1 boy and 1 girl is equal to 1 minus the probability that the committee is either all boys or all girls
The number of ways to choose a committee of all boys is $\binom{10}{5}=252$, the number of ways to choose a committee of all girls is $\binom{15}{5}=3,\!003$, and the total number of committees is $\binom{25}{5}=53,\!130$, so the probability of selecting a committee of all boys or all girls is $\dfrac{252+3003}{53,\!130}=\dfrac{31}{506}$
Thus the probability that the committee contains at least one boy and one girl is $1-\dfrac{31}{506} = \boxed{\dfrac{475}{506}}$.
For each positive integer $n$, let $S_n = \{k:1\leq k\leq
n\}$, and let $c_n$ be the number of spacy subsets of $S_n$
Then $c_1=2$, $c_2=3$, and $c_3=4$
For $n\geq 4$, the spacy subsets of $S_n$ can be partitioned into two types:  those that contain $n$ and those that do not
Those that do not contain $n$ are precisely the spacy subsets of $S_{n-1}$
Those that contain $n$ do not contain either $n-1$ or $n-2$ and are therefore in one-to-one correspondence with the spacy subsets of $S_{n-3}$
It follows that $c_n=c_{n-3}+c_{n-1}$
Thus the first twelve terms in the sequence $\left(c_n\right)$ are $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, $9$, $13$, $19$, $28$, $41$, $60$, $88$, $129$, and there are $c_{12}=\boxed{129}$ spacy subsets of $S_{12}$.
There are 3 used in the first stage, and 2 in every stage thereafter
Thus, for the 15th stage, there will be $3 + 2(14) = \boxed{31}$ toothpicks used.
We can choose 2 people to shake hands with each other out of a group of 8 people in $\binom{8}{2} = \boxed{28}$ ways.
The number of total ways to choose the 5 officers is $\binom{16}{5} = 4368$
Of these, the number of ways to choose the officers without ANY of the past officers is $\binom{9}{5} = 126$
Thus, the number of ways to choose the 5 officers with at least 1 past officer is $4368 - 126 = \boxed{4242}.$
$\dfrac{9!}{6!3!} = \dfrac{9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times \cdots \times 1}{(6 \times 5 \times \cdots \times 1) \times (3 \times 2 \times 1)} = \dfrac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \boxed{84}$.
Since there are so few numbers, we could simply list each of the $4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24$ combinations, but let's look at a more mathematical approach which we could also apply to larger sets of numbers.
We first consider how many of the numbers start with the digit $1.$ We have three more digits $(2,$ $3,$ and $4)$ to use
We can pick any of the three choices for the digit after the $1,$ and then either of the $2$ remaining choices for the third number, and finally, the $1$ remaining choice for the final number
Thus there are $3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$ possibilities for numbers that begin with the digit $1.$ $($For completeness, these are: $1234,$ $1243,$ $1324,$ $1342,$ $1423,$ $1432.)$
The same reasoning can be used for numbers that begin with the digit $2.$ Therefore there are $6$ numbers which begin with $2.$ $($For completeness, these are: $2134,$ $2143,$ $2314,$ $2341,$ $2413,$ $2431.)$ After this, we have found a total of $12$ of the numbers in the list of $4$-digit integers with the digits $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ and $4.$
We also have $6$ different numbers which can be formed with a leading $3.$ This makes a total of $18$ different numbers, since we want the $15^\text{th}$ number, we can simply list these out in order from least to greatest, as specified in the problem.
$\bullet$ The $13^\text{th}$ number is $3124.$
$\bullet$ The $14^\text{th}$ number is $3142.$
$\bullet$ The $15^\text{th}$ number is $3214.$
$\bullet$ The $16^\text{th}$ number is $3241.$
$\bullet$ The $17^\text{th}$ number is $3412.$
$\bullet$ The $18^\text{th}$ number is $3421.$
Thus our answer is the $15\text{th}$ number, or $\boxed{3214}.$
Note that we could have stopped listing the numbers above once we got to the $15\text{th}$ number.
There are 26 ways to choose the first card to be red, then 26 ways to choose the second card to be black
There are $52 \times 51$ ways to choose any two cards
So the probability is $\dfrac{26 \times 26}{52 \times 51} = \boxed{\dfrac{13}{51}}$.
The product of all six rolls is odd if and only if each roll is odd
Any given roll has an odd result with probability $\frac{1}{2}$
The probability of all six rolls being odd is therefore $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \boxed{\frac{1}{64}}$.
To construct a team of 2 girls and 2 boys, we must consider how many ways to choose the 2 girls and then the 2 boys
Since there are 3 girls and 5 boys to choose from, the number of teams is ${5 \choose 2} \cdot {3 \choose 2} = 10 \cdot 3 = \boxed{30}$.
All of the integers in the set $S$ have exactly one complementary number, $12-x$, such that their sum is 12, except for the number 6
Because $6+6= 12$, and the two numbers chosen are distinct, removing 6 will not eliminate any of the pairs that sum to 12, and it will reduce the total number of pairs possible
So $n=\boxed{6}$.
\begin{align*}
\dbinom{9}{2}\times \dbinom{7}{2} &= \dfrac{9!}{2!7!}\times \dfrac{7!}{2!5!} \\
&= \dfrac{9!}{2!2!5!} \\
&= \dfrac{9\times 8\times 7\times 6}{(2\times 1)\times (2\times 1)} \\
&= 9\times 2\times 7\times 6 \\
&= \boxed{756}.
\end{align*}
Let $B$ denote drawing a black ball and $W$ denote drawing a white ball.
There are two possible successful orders: $BWBWBWBW$ or $WBWBWBWB.$
There are $\binom{8}{4} = 70$ ways to arrange four $B$'s and four $W$'s, so the probability that a random arrangement is successful is $\dfrac{2}{70} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{35}}$.
We could also compute this based on the probabilities at each step that we draw a ball of the opposite color
If we do that, we get $\frac47 \times \frac36 \times \frac35 \times \frac24 \times \frac23 \times \frac12 = \frac{144}{5040} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{35}}$.
Solution 1: For each of 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can either choose to include the number in the set, or choose to exclude it
We therefore have 2 choices for each of these 4 numbers, which gives us a total of $2^4 = \boxed{16}$ different subsets we can form.
Solution 2: We can have either 5 by itself, 5 with one other number from the four, 5 with two other numbers, 5 with three other numbers, or 5 with all four other numbers
The number of ways to form a subset with 5 by itself is $\binom{4}{0}$
The number of ways to form a subset with 5 and one other number is $\binom{4}{1}$
Similarly, the number of ways to form a subset with 5 and two other numbers is $\binom{4}{2}$, with three other numbers is $\binom{4}{3}$, and with all four other numbers is $\binom{4}{4}$
Thus, our answer is $1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = \boxed{16}$.
There is a $\dfrac{1}{2}$ probability that each coin comes up heads, so the expected value of the coins, in cents, that come up heads is $\dfrac{1}{2}(1 + 5+ 10 + 25) = \boxed{20.5}$.
We first count the total number of three-digit integers we can construct
Since each digit can occur in each of the three spins, there are $3^3 = 27$ possible integers
Since we are only looking for numbers that are divisible by 4, we know the units digit must be even
In this case, the only possibility for an even units digit is 2
The divisibility rule for 4 is any number in which the last two digits are divisible by 4 - in this case, 12 and 32
The hundreds digit doesn't matter
There are 6 possibilities, 112, 132, 212, 232, 312, and 332
Therefore, the probability is $\frac{6}{27}=\boxed{\frac{2}{9}}$.
Each outcome of rolling a 6-sided die has probability $\frac16$, and the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
So the expected value is $$ \frac16(1) + \frac16(2) + \frac16(3) + \frac16(4) + \frac16(5) + \frac16(6) = \frac{21}{6} = \boxed{3.5}
The point $(x,y)$ satisfies $x < y$ if and only if it belongs to the shaded triangle bounded by the lines $x=y$, $y=2$, and $x=0$, the area of which is 2
The rectangle has area 6, so the probability in question is $\dfrac{2}{6} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}$.

In all cases, at least half of John's kids will be boys or at least half will be girls
Furthermore, since John has an odd number of children, these conditions are mutually exclusive--that is, they are never true at the same time
Since a boy is equally likely to be born as is a girl, our answer is therefore $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
\begin{align*}
\dbinom{6}{3} &= \dfrac{6!}{3!3!} \\
&= \dfrac{6\times 5\times 4}{3\times 2\times 1} \\
&= \dfrac{6}{3\times 2\times 1} \times 5 \times 4 \\
&= 1 \times 5 \times 4 \\
&= \boxed{20}.
\end{align*}
There are 9000 four-digit numbers, from 1000 to 9999, inclusive
Rather than counting the numbers with repeated digits, we'll count the numbers without a repeated digit
In this case, there are 9 choices for the first digit (all except 0), 9 choices for the second digit (all except the first), 8 choices for the third digit (two are already picked), and 7 choices for the fourth digit (three are already picked)
Therefore, there are $9\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7$ numbers without a repeated digit, leaving $9000-9\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7$ numbers with a repeated digit
To find the percent, we divide this result by 9000, so we get $$\frac{9000-9\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7}{9000}=\frac{1000-504}{1000}=.496$$which is $49.6$ percent
Therefore, $x = \boxed{49.6}.$
$\dbinom{9}{8} = \dfrac{9!}{8!1!}=\dfrac{9\times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2}{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}=\boxed{9}$.
We can get the second marble to be yellow in two ways:  either a white from A (with probability 3/7) then a yellow from B (with probability 6/10), or a black from A (with probability 4/7) then a yellow from C (with probability 2/7)
Thus, the probability is \[ \left(\frac{3}{7}\times\frac{6}{10}\right)+\left(\frac{4}{7}\times\frac{2}{7}\right)=\boxed{\frac{103}{245}}.\]
We can factor n! out of the left-hand side: \begin{align*}
n\cdot n! +n! &= (n+1)(n!)\\
&= (n+1)!\\
\end{align*}We see that $(n+1)! = 720 = 6!$,  so $n+1 = 6$ and $n = \boxed{5}$.
The probability that it rains and Sheila attends is $(0.4)(0.2) = 0.08$
The probability that it doesn't rain and Sheila attends is $(0.6)(0.8) = 0.48$
So the overall probability that Sheila attends is $0.08 + 0.48 = \boxed{0.56 = 56\%}$.
Since none of the palindromes between 100 and 500 begin with a 5, the only place a 5 can appear is in the tens digit
Therefore, there are 4 palindromes between 100 and 500 with a 5: 151, 252, 353, and 454
To count the total number of palindromes, we observe that there are 4 choices to make for the first/last digit and 10 choices to make for the middle digit
Therefore, the percentage of palindromes that contain 5 as a digit is $\frac{4}{4\cdot 10}=\boxed{10\%}$.
Using the Binomial Theorem, we know that the $x^5$ term of the expansion is $\binom{7}{5}(2x)^5(3)^{7-5}=(21)(32x^5)(9)=(21)(32)(9)x^5=\boxed{6048}x^5$.
Coach Grunt has to choose 3 players from the 10 players that are remaining after Ace and Zeppo have been placed in the lineup
The order in which the players are chosen doesn't matter, so the answer is $$ \binom{10}{3} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \boxed{120}
Since the sum of the probabilities of all possible events is equal to 1, the probability that Asha loses is $1-(4/9)=\boxed{\frac{5}{9}}$.
$\dbinom{10}{8}=\dbinom{10}{2}=\boxed{45}.$
First, we count the number of total outcomes
Each toss has $2$ possibilities - heads or tails - so the $7$ tosses have $2^7 = 128$ possible outcomes.
To count the number of outcomes with at least $5$ consecutive heads, we need to use casework.
$\bullet$  Case 1: Exactly $5$ heads
There are three positions for a string of $5$ heads in a row, so there are $3$ possibilities in this case.
$\bullet$  Case 2: Exactly $6$ heads in a row
There are two positions for a string of $6$ heads in a row, so there are $2$ possibilities in this case.
$\bullet$  Case 3: Exactly $6$ heads, but not six in a row
There are two possibilities: either the first five coins and the last coin are heads, or the last five coins and the first coin are heads.
$\bullet$  Case 4: $7$ heads
There's only $1$ way to do this -- all $7$ tosses must be heads.
So there are $3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8$ successful outcomes, hence the probability is $\frac{8}{128}=\boxed{\frac{1}{16}}.$
Call the height $h$ and the width $w$
We want to find the number of solutions to $2(w+h)=64$ or $w+h=32$
The solutions to this are  \[
\{(1,31),(2,30),\ldots,(16,16),\ldots,(31,1)\}.
\] There are 31 solutions to this, but we are double-counting all the rectangles for which $w \neq h$
There are 30 of these, so the total number of rectangles is $\frac{30}{2}+1=\boxed{16}$ rectangles.
Insert leading zeros if necessary to give every page number three digits
Every digit is used an equal number of times in writing the digits 00, 01, 02, ..., 98, 99, so from page 1 to page 399, the number of 4's used and the number of 8's used are equal.
From page 400 to page 488, there are 89 appearances of 4 as a hundreds digit versus 0 appearances of 8 as a hundreds digit
All 10 numbers 440, 441, ..., 449 with 4 as the tens digit are printed, whereas only the 9 numbers 480, 481, ..., 488 with 8 as the tens digit are printed
So 4 is used one more time than 8 as a tens digit
Four and 8 appear 9 times each as a units digit in the numbers 400, 401, ..., 488, so there are no extra 4's in the units place
In total, $89+1+0=\boxed{90}$ more 4's are printed than 8's.
We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's
So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's
There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each
If he rolls two of each, there are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's
If he rolls one of each, there are $\binom{4}{1}\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice
If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice
In total, there are $6+12\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's
There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\dfrac{1}{2} \left(1-\dfrac{454}{1296}\right)=\boxed{\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.
To find the coefficient of $a^2b^2$ in $(a+b)^4\left(c+\dfrac{1}{c}\right)^6$, we need to find the coefficient of $a^2b^2$ in $(a+b)^4$ and the constant term of $\left(c+\dfrac{1}{c}\right)^6$
Using the Binomial Theorem, we find that these are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ and $\binom{6}{3}=20$
The coefficient of $a^2b^2$ in $(a+b)^4\left(c+\dfrac{1}{c}\right)^6$ is the product of these, or $\boxed{120}$.
This problem uses the identity $0!=1$ $$\dbinom{8}{0}=\frac{8!}{8!0!}=\frac{1}{0!}=\frac{1}{1}=\boxed{1}$$
We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1
From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99
Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\frac{9}{90} = \frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\frac{1}{10}= \boxed{\frac{9}{10}}$.
Write $5!+6!=5!(1+6)=2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdot7$
The largest prime factor of this integer is $\boxed{7}$.
The probability of getting two tails followed by one head is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3=\frac{1}{8}$
The probability of getting a tail followed by a head followed by a tail is also $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3=\frac{1}{8}$
Finally, the probability of getting a head followed by two tails is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3=\frac{1}{8}$ as well
In total, the probability of getting two tails and one head is $\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}=\boxed{\frac{3}{8}}$.
Denote the ratio by $x:y$, where $x$ is the number of red candies and $y$ is the number of green
We can have $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, or $4$ red candies and $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$ green candies
Thus, there are $5 \cdot 4 = 20$ potential ratios
However, a $0:0$ ratio is not allowed (there would be no candy!), so we subtract one for a total of $19$ ratios possible
Now we must subtract the ratios we've over-counted
In particular, $0:1$ is the same as $0:2$ and $0:3$, and $1:0$ is the same as $2:0$, $3:0$, and $4:0$
Also, $1:1$ is the same as $2:2$ and $3:3$, and $2:1$ is the same as $4:2$
Thus, we have over-counted by $8$ ratios, so our final answer is $19 - 8 = \boxed{11}$.
We consider the opposite; we try to find the number of words that do not contain A, and then subtract it from the total possible number of words
So we have a few cases to consider:
$\bullet$  One letter words: There is only $1$ one-letter word that contains A, that's A.
$\bullet$  Two letter words: There are $19\times19=361$ words that do not contain A
There is a total of $20\times20=400$ words, so we have $400-361=39$ words that satisfy the condition.
$\bullet$  Three letter words: There are $19\times19\times19=6859$ words without A, and there are $20^{3}=8000$ words available
So there are $8000-6859=1141$ words that satisfy the condition.
$\bullet$  Four letter words: Using the same idea as above, we have $20^{4}-19^{4}=29679$ words satisfying the requirement.
So this gives a total of $1+39+1141+29679=\boxed{30860}$ words.
To make the arithmetic a little easier, we can write out 7! as $7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 7 \times 5 \times 3^2 \times 2^4$
And, $5 \times 8 \times 2 = 5 \times 2^4$
So, $n = \frac{7 \times 5 \times 3^2 \times 2^4}{5 \times 2^4} = 7 \times 3^2 = \boxed{63}$.
Since the two letters have to be next to each other, think of them as forming a two-letter word $w$
So each license plate consists of 4 digits and $w$
For each digit there are 10 choices
There are $26\cdot 26$ choices for the letters of $w$, and  there are 5 choices for the position of $w$
So the total number of distinct license plates is $5\cdot10^4\cdot26^2 = \boxed{33,\!800,\!000}$.
It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect powers
We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \ldots, 5^{3}$
Notice all the perfect fourth powers are also perfect squares
Similarly, all the perfect sixth powers are also perfect squares
The only perfect powers not yet counted are $2^5=32$ and $2^7=128$
Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1$ and $2^{6} = 64$ which we counted both as perfect squares and perfect cubes
So there is a total $12+5+1+1-2=17$ of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect powers
Thus, $150-17=133$ integers are not perfect powers
The probability that we select such a number is $\boxed{\frac{133}{150}}$.
He can choose 3 marbles from 7 distinct marbles in $\binom{7}{3}=\boxed{35}$ ways.
Pick one of the schools as the host
There are $\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to select the two representatives from that school and $\dbinom{5}{1}$ ways to pick a representative from each of the other schools
So once we have selected a host school, there are $10\times5\times5=250$ ways to pick the representatives
However, any of the three schools can be the host, so we need to multiply $250$ by $3$ to get $\boxed{750}$ ways.
There are 3 ways to choose who finishes first
For each possibility, there are 2 ways to choose who comes in second, and the remaining person comes in last
That gives us $3\cdot 2 \cdot 1 = \boxed{6}$ possible orders.
\begin{align*}
\dbinom{14}{11} &= \dbinom{14}{3} \\
&= \dfrac{14!}{11!3!} \\
&= \dfrac{14\times 13\times 12}{3\times 2\times 1} \\
&= 14 \times 13 \times \dfrac{12}{3\times 2\times 1} \\
&= 14\times 13\times 2 \\
&= \boxed{364}.
\end{align*}
Orient the cube so that the blue face is on top
At least one red face must be adjacent to the blue face, and the other red face can be in one of $\boxed{3}$ distinct positions relative to these two (see figure)
The green faces are determined by the placement of the red and blue faces

The number of painted faces is $9(6)=54$
However, the four edge faces painted on each face are also painted on the other face
Thus $4(6)=24$ of the painted faces are on cubes with two painted faces
These account for only $12$ painted cubes, in addition to the $54-24=30$ singly painted cubes
So there are $42$ painted cubes, leaving $125-42=\boxed{83}$ unpainted cubes.
There are $\binom{12}{3} = \boxed{220}$ ways to pick any 3 points, which we assume to determine a unique plane.
Looking at the ranking sequence, we see that A and B cannot both win on Saturday, and so neither AB nor BA can be the first and second places
Similarly, CD and DC cannot be the third and fourth places
Thus, the first and second place may be (A or B) and (C or D) or vice versa
This makes 2 (for the order) $\times 2\times 2 = 8$ possibilities for the first and second places
Then the third and fourth places can be two possible arrangements of the losers
In total, this is $8\times 2 = \boxed{16}$ arrangements.
There are $\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which two of the five marbles John chose were green
For any of those 10 choices, there is a $\left( \frac{6}{10} \right) ^2 \left( \frac{4}{10} \right) ^3 = \frac{72}{3125}$ chance for that choice to happen
The total probability is then $10 \cdot \frac{72}{3125}= \boxed{\frac{144}{625}}$.
The first four-digit multiple of 3 is 1002, which is $3\times 334$
The last is 9999, which is $3\times 3333$
From 334 to 3333, inclusive, there are $3333-334+1 = 3000$ positive integers
So, there are $\boxed{3000}$ positive integers that are multiples of 3
Notice that this happens to equal $9000/3$
Is this a coincidence?  (Beware of always using this reasoning!  What if we asked for the number of multiples of 7?)
Any positive integer divisor of $N$ must take the form $2^a \cdot 3^b \cdot 5^c \cdot 7^d$ where $0 \leq a \leq 4$, $0 \leq b \le 3$, $0 \le c \le 2$, $0\leq d \leq 2$
In other words, there are 5 choices for $a$, 4 choices for $b$, 3 choices for $c$, and 3 choices for $d$
So there are $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 3= \boxed{180}$ natural-number factors of $N$.
We quickly note that the only way for three dice to sum to 18 is for the face of each to be a 6
So, if each die is a 6, then the probability of this occurring is $\frac{1}{6^3} = \boxed{\frac{1}{216}}$.
There are $\binom{9}{4}=126$ ways to choose the seats for the four math majors
Of these ways, there are only 9 where the four math majors sit in consecutive seats
Therefore, the probability that the math majors sit in consecutive seats is $\frac{9}{126}=\boxed{\frac{1}{14}}$.
The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\dfrac{1}{13}$
There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\dfrac{4}{51}$
The answer is then $\dfrac{1}{13} \times \dfrac{4}{51} = \boxed{\dfrac{4}{663}}$.
Choosing a committee is a combination, and order does not matter
We are choosing a 4-person committee from 9 people, so there are $9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6$ ways to pick the four people for the positions, but then we must divide by $4!$ since order doesn't matter, so the answer is $\dfrac{9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{4!} =\boxed{126}$.
Since there are 4 houses and 4 packages, we can choose ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ pairs of houses to be the pair that will receive the correct package
In that case, the other two houses must have one another's package
The probability of this occuring for any arrangement is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}$, as the first fraction represents the probability of a given house getting the correct package, and the second fraction the subsequent probability that the other given house gets the correct package, and the final fraction the probability that the last two houses have each other's packages
So, the probability is $6 \cdot \frac{1}{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4} = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
In Pascal's triangle, the $k^\text{th}$ element in the row $n$ has the value $\binom{n}{k-1}.$ Row $15$ starts with $\binom{15}{0},$ $\binom{15}{1},$ $\binom{15}{2},$ $\binom{15}{3},$ so the fourth element is $$\binom{15}{3}=\frac{15!}{3!(15-3)!}=\frac{15\cdot14\cdot13}{3\cdot2\cdot1}=5\cdot7\cdot13=\boxed{455}.$$
There are nine possible digits that the hundreds digit could be
However, there are only four possible endings for the number: 46, 64, 28, and 82
Thus, there are $9 \cdot 4 = \boxed{36}$ such numbers.
For each friend, there are 3 options for which team to put them on
Since each of the 6 people have 3 options, there are $3^6=\boxed{729}$ to divide the group of friends.
With the ten points on the circumference of a circle, any set of 4 of them will form a convex (indeed, cyclic) quadrilateral
So, with ten points, and we can choose any 4 of them to form a distinct quadrilateral, we get ${10 \choose 4} = \frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = 10 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 = \boxed{210}$ quadrilaterals.
First, we can find the denominator of our fraction
There are a total of $\dbinom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose 3 marbles out of 6
To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one marble of each color
There are 2 ways we could choose a red marble, 2 ways to choose a blue, and 2 ways to choose a green, making a total of $2\cdot 2 \cdot 2=8$ ways to choose one marble of each color
Our final probability is $\frac{8}{20}=\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.
Let us call the circle's center $O$
We first note that if $A$ and $B$ are points on the circle, then triangle $AOB$ is isosceles with $AO= BO$
Therefore, if $AOB$ is an obtuse triangle, then the obtuse angle must be at $O$
So $AOB$ is an obtuse triangle if and only if minor arc $AB$ has measure of more than $\pi/2$ ($90^\circ$).
Now, let the three randomly chosen points be $A_0$, $A_1$, and $A_2$
Let $\theta$ be the measure of minor arc $A_0A_1$
Since $\theta$ is equally likely to be any value from 0 to $\pi$, the probability that it is less than $\pi/2$ is 1/2.
Now suppose that $\theta < \pi/2$
For the problem's condition to hold, it is necessary and sufficient for point $A_2$ to lie within $\pi/2$ of both $A_0$ and $A_1$ along the circumference
As the diagram below shows, this is the same as saying that $A_2$ must lie along a particular arc of measure $\pi - \theta$.

[/asy]
The probability of this occurrence is $\frac{\pi-\theta}{2\pi} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2\pi}$, since $A_2$ is equally likely to go anywhere on the circle
Since the average value of $\theta$ between 0 and $\pi/2$ is $\pi/4$, it follows that the overall probability for $\theta < \pi/2$ is $\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\pi/4}{2\pi} = \frac{3}{8}$.
Since the probability that $\theta < \pi/2$ is 1/2, our final probability is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \boxed{\frac{3}{16}}$.
By the Binomial Theorem, the coefficient that we want is just $\binom{8}{4}=\boxed{70}$.
We can split this up into cases.
First, consider the case when all three plants are under the same color lamp
Either all three plants are under the same lamp, both basil plants are under one lamp and the aloe plant is under the other lamp, or the aloe plant and one basil plant are under one lamp and the other basil plant is under the other lamp
This case gives us three possibilities for each color of lamp, for a total of six possibilities.
Next, consider the case where the aloe plant is under a different color of lamp than the two basil plants
Since the two lamps of the same color the aloe plant can be under are identical, it doesn't matter which one the aloe plant is under
The basil plants can either both be under the same lamp, or each be under a different lamp
This case gives us two possibilities when the aloe is under a white lamp and two possibilities when the aloe is under a red lamp, for a total of four possibilities.
Last, consider the case where the basil plants are each under a different colored lamp
The aloe plant can be under the same white lamp as a basil plant, the same red lamp as a basil plant, a different white lamp from the basil plant, or a different red lamp from the basil plant, for a total of four possibilities
In all, there are $6+4+4=\boxed{14}$ possibilities.
We proceed using casework on the choice of second digit: \[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline
\text{Tens digit} & \text{Units digit} \\ \hline
0 & 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \\ \hline
1 & 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \\ \hline
2 & 4,5,6,7,8,9 \\ \hline
3 & 6,7,8,9 \\ \hline
4 & 8,9 \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]The hundreds digit can be any of $1,2,\dots,9.$ The answer is $(10+8+6+4+2)\times 9=\boxed{270}.$
Since Allison will always roll a 5, we must calculate the probability that both Brian and Noah roll a 4 or lower
The probability of Brian rolling a 4 or lower is $\frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$ since Brian has a standard die
Noah, however, has a $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ probability of rolling a 4 or lower, since the only way he can do so is by rolling one of his 3 sides that have a 2
So, the probability of both of these independent events occurring is $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
Each number from 1 to 6 has probability $\dfrac16$ of being rolled, so the expected value is \begin{align*}
E &= \left(\dfrac{1}{6}\times \$1^2\right) + \left(\dfrac{1}{6}\times \$2^2\right) + \cdots + \left(\dfrac{1}{6} \times \$6^2\right) \\
&= \dfrac{1}{6}(\$1 + \$4 + \$9 + \$16 + \$25 + \$36) \\
&= \$\dfrac{91}{6} \\
& \approx \boxed{\$15.17}.
\end{align*}
Since the sum of the three probabilities is 1, the probability of stopping on region $C$ is $1 - \frac{1}{3} -
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{6} - \frac{2}{6} - \frac{3}{6} = \boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$.
Let $x$ be the probability that we want
Since the sum of the four probabilities is 1, we have the equation $1 = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{4} + x + x = \frac{5}{8} + 2x$
Solving the equation $1=\frac{5}{8} + 2x$ gives $x=\boxed{\frac{3}{16}}$.
The only primes on a die are 2, 3, and 5
The only composites are 4 and 6
The only other option is rolling a 1
There is a $\dfrac{1}{6}$ probability that she will roll a 1 and lose $\$3$, a $\dfrac{1}{3}$ probability of rolling a composite and winning $\$0$, and a $\dfrac{1}{6}$ probability of winning each of $\$2$, $\$3$, or $\$5$
So $$E = \dfrac{1}{3}\times \$0 + \dfrac{1}{6}\times(\$2+\$3+\$5) + \dfrac{1}{6} \times -\$3 \approx \boxed{\$1.17}.$$
Note that if each person shakes hands with every other person, then the number of handshakes is maximized
There are $\binom{23}{2} = \frac{(23)(22)}{2} = (23)(11) = 230+23 = \boxed{253}$ ways to choose two people to form a handshake.
We can choose the middle color for the flag in 4 ways, then choose the top color in 3 ways, and finally choose the bottom color in 3 ways (the only restriction is that the top and bottom colors are both different from the middle color)
This leads to a total of $4\cdot 3\cdot 3 = \boxed{36}$ possible flags.
$\dbinom{50}{2} = \dfrac{50!}{2!48!}=\dfrac{50\times 49}{2\times 1}=\boxed{1225}.$
A seven-sided polygon has seven vertices
There are ${7 \choose 2} = 21$ ways to connect the pairs of these 7 points
But 7 of those pairs are pairs of consecutive vertices, so they are counted as sides
So, only $21 - 7 = \boxed{14}$ of these segments are diagonals.
Let $x$ denote the common sum of the numbers on each line
Then $4x$ gives the sum of all the numbers $A, B, \ldots, J,$ but with $J$ counted four times
Since the sum of the numbers on the octagon must be $1 + 2 + \dots + 9 = 45,$ we have $4x = 45 + 3J$ (where $J$ represents the number written at that vertex)
Thus, $45 + 3J$ must be a multiple of $4$, which occurs exactly when $J \in \{1, 5, 9\}.$
If $J = 1,$ then $4x = 45 + 3J = 48,$ so $x = 12.$ It follows that the sum of each pair of diametrically opposite vertices is $12 - 1 = 11,$ so we must pair up the numbers $\{2, 9\}$, $\{3, 8\}$, $\{4, 7\}$, and $\{5, 6\}.$ There are $4!$ ways to assign the four pairs, and then $2^4$ ways to assign the two numbers in each individual pair
Therefore, in the case $J = 1$, there are $4! \cdot 2^4 = 384$ ways to label the vertices.
The cases $J = 5$ and $J = 9$ are the same, and also produce $384$ valid ways
Thus, the total number of ways to label the vertices is $3 \cdot 384 = \boxed{1152}.$
There are four possible cases for the Cubs winning the World Series, depending on the number of games that Red Sox win before the Cubs win their fourth game: the Red Sox can win no games, one game, two games, or three games
In general, if the Red Sox win exactly $k$ games before the Cubs win their 4th game, there will be a total of $3+k$ games played before the last one (which the Cubs must win), there will be a total of $\dbinom{3+k}{k}$ ways of selecting the games that the Red Sox win out of those, and for each of those arrangements the Cubs will win their 4 games with probability $\left(\dfrac{3}{5}\right)^4$ and the Red Sox will win the $k$ games that are selected for them with probability $\left(\dfrac{2}{5}\right)^k$, so we are left to evaluate the expression $\dbinom{3+k}{k}\left(\dfrac{3}{5}\right)^4\left(\dfrac{2}{5}\right)^k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$
This gives us our final probability of  \begin{align*}
&\dbinom{3}{0}\left(\dfrac{3}{5}\right)^4\left(\dfrac{2}{5}\right)^0 + \dbinom{3+1}{1}\left(\dfrac{3}{5}\right)^4\left(\dfrac{2}{5}\right)^1 + \\
&\qquad\qquad\dbinom{3+2}{2}\left(\dfrac{3}{5}\right)^4\left(\dfrac{2}{5}\right)^2 + \dbinom{3+3}{3}\left(\dfrac{3}{5}\right)^4\left(\dfrac{2}{5}\right)^3
\end{align*} which simplifies to  \begin{align*}
&\ \ \ \ 1\cdot(.1296)\cdot1+4\cdot(.1296)\cdot(.4)\\
&+10\cdot(.1296)\cdot(.16)+20\cdot(.1296)\cdot(.064)=.7102\ldots,
\end{align*} so our answer is $\boxed{71}$ percent.
Because our chess board is $4 \times 4$, there must be exactly one pawn in each column and each row
Consider the ways to place one pawn in each row
In the first row, there are four potential spots for a pawn
However, no matter where we place the pawn, it takes up one column
So, in the second row, there are only three potential spots for a pawn
Similarly, there are two spots in the third row and only one in the fourth
Thus, there are $4\cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24$ ways in which we can place the pawns
Now, because each pawn is distinct, we have four possible pawns to place in the first slot, three in the second, two in the fourth, and one in the last
So there are $24$ possible orderings of the pawns
Our final answer is thus $24^2 = \boxed{576}$.
Before new letters were added, five different letters could have been chosen for the first position, three for the second, and four for the third
This means that $5\cdot 3\cdot 4=60$ plates could have been made.
If two letters are added to the second set, then $5\cdot 5\cdot 4=100$ plates can be made
If one letter is added to each of the second and third sets, then $5\cdot 4\cdot 5=100$ plates can be made
None of the other four ways to place the two letters will create as many plates
So, $100-60=\boxed{40}$ ADDITIONAL plates can be made.
Note: Optimum results can usually be obtained in such problems by making the factors as nearly equal as possible.
Let the expected value of the number of times Bob rolls his die on a single day be $E$
When Bob rolls his die, there is a $\frac{5}{6}$ chance that he will stop rolling after one roll, and a $\frac{1}{6}$ chance that he will have to start over
In the second case, since his first roll had no effect on the outcome, Bob will on average roll his die $E$ more times, for a total of $1+E$ times that day
Therefore, we know that $E=\frac{5}{6}(1)+\frac{1}{6}(1+E)$, or that $E=\frac{6}{5}$
Over 365 days, Bob will roll his die an average of $\frac{6}{5}\cdot365=\boxed{438}$ times total.
There are 10 people to place, so we can place them in $10!$ ways, but this counts each valid arrangement 10 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement)
So the number of ways to seat them is $\dfrac{10!}{10} = 9! = \boxed{362,\!880}$.
We will use complementary counting for this problem, which is a big fancy term for saying we will determine the probability of the event we want NOT occuring
Then we will subtract our answer from 1 to get the real answer
So, what is the probability of the product being an odd number? This is an easier question to answer because it requires that both numbers be odd
There are a total of ${5 \choose 2} = 10$ pairs of distinct numbers, and with only 3 of them odd, ${3 \choose 2} = 3$ pairs of odd numbers
So, the probability of having an odd product is $\frac{3}{10}$, leaving the probability of an even product being $1- \frac{3}{10} = \boxed{\frac{7}{10}}$.
There are $12$ even numbers and $5$ multiples of $5$ in the range $1$ to $25$
However, we have double-counted $10$ and $20$, which are divisible by both $2$ and $5$
So the number of good outcomes is $12+5-2=15$ and the probability is $\frac{15}{25}=\boxed{\frac{3}{5}}$.
For each of Alex's five problems, there are 10 friends he can give it to
Therefore, there are $10^5=\boxed{100,\!000}$ ways for Alex to distribute the problems.
It might be easier to find the integers less than or equal to 30 which are NOT relatively prime to 30
They include 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, $\ldots$, 28, 30, or 15 even integers
They also include 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, or the odd multiples of 3
And also, 5, 25, the multiples of 5 relatively prime to 2 and 3
So we have a total of $15+5+2 = 22$ numbers sharing a factor with 30
So there are 8 relatively prime integers, giving us a ratio of $\frac{8}{30} = \boxed{\frac{4}{15}}$.
Notice that the prime divisors of 30 are 2, 3, and 5, and we have $$30\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{5}\right) = 30 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = 8,$$ which equals the number of positive integers less than 30 that are relatively prime to 30
Is this a coincidence?
There are 3 ways for John to decide which of the red, green, and blue marbles to choose
After he has chosen one of them, he must choose 3 marbles from the other 9
There are $\binom{9}{3}=84$ ways for him to do this
The total number of valid ways for John to choose four marbles is $3\cdot 84=\boxed{252}$.
In a regular pentagon, there are $5$ sides of the same length and $5$ diagonals of the same length
Picking an element at random will leave 4 elements with the same length as the element picked, with $9$ total elements remaining
Therefore, the probability that the second element has the same length as the first is simply $\boxed{\tfrac{4}{9}}.$
There are $6!=720$ ways to order the Spiderman comics, $5!=120$ ways to order the Archie ones, and $4!=24$ ways to order the Garfield books
This means that there are $720\cdot120\cdot24$ ways to order the books within their groups
Once we have done that, we need to place the 3 groups of comics in a stack
There are 3 options for which type of comics goes on the bottom, 2 options for which type goes in the middle, and 1 type of comic left which we put on top
This means that our final answer is $720\cdot120\cdot24\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1=\boxed{12,\!441,\!600}$ ways in which to order all the comics.
The probability of it snowing on any one day is $\frac{3}{4}$ so the probability of it not snowing on any one day is $\frac{1}{4}$
So, the probability it not snowing on all three days is $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^3 = \boxed{\frac{1}{64}}$.
The first guide can take any combination of tourists except all the tourists or none of the tourists
Therefore the number of possibilities is \[
\binom{6}{1}+\binom{6}{2}+\binom{6}{3}+\binom{6}{4}+\binom{6}{5}=6+15+20+15+6=62.
If each guide did not need to take at least one tourist, then each tourist could choose one of the two guides independently
In this case there would be $2^6=64$ possible arrangements
The two arrangements for which all tourists choose the same guide must be excluded, leaving a total of $64-2=\boxed{62}$ possible arrangements.
There are five slots on which the spinner can land with each spin; thus, there are 125 total possibilities with three spins
The only way in which you can earn exactly $ \$ 1700$ in three spins is by landing on a $ \$ 300$, a $ \$ 400$, and a $ \$ 1000$
You could land on any one of the three in your first spin, any one of the remaining two in your second spin, and the remaining one in your last spin, so there are $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6$ ways in which you can earn $ \$ 1700$
Thus, the probability is $\boxed{\frac{6}{125}}$.
There are 4 cubes with 2 painted faces, 24 with 1, and 36 with none
There are $\binom{64}{2} = \frac{64\cdot 63}{2 \cdot 1} = 2016$ ways to choose two cubes
There are 4 ways to choose a cube painted on exactly two sides, and 36 ways to choose one that is not painted at all, for a total of $4\cdot 36=144$ successful outcomes
Therefore, the desired probability is $\frac{144}{2016} = \frac{36}{504} = \frac{9}{126} = \boxed{\frac{1}{14}}$.
There are three different possibilities for our first decision, each corresponding to which container we choose
So, if we choose container I, with $\frac{1}{3}$ probability, we have a $\frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}$ probability for a $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}$ probability of getting green from Container I
Similarly for container II the probability is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{9}$, and the same for container III
So, the total probability is $\frac{1}{9} + \frac{2}{9} + \frac{2}{9} = \boxed{\frac{5}{9}}$.
The numbers on one die total $1+2+3+4+5+6=21$, so the numbers on the three dice total 63
Numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are visible, and these total 22
This leaves $63-22=\boxed{41}$ not seen.
We note that $xy-x-y$ is very close to the expansion of $(x-1)(y-1)$
(This is basically a use of Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick.)
If $xy-x-y$ is even, then $xy-x-y+1 = (x-1)(y-1)$ is odd
This only occurs when $x-1$ and $y-1$ are both odd, so $x$ and $y$ must be even
There are $\binom{5}{2}$ distinct pairs of even integers, and $\binom{10}{2}$ distinct pairs of integers, so the probability is $\dfrac{\binom{5}{2}}{\binom{10}{2}} = \boxed{\frac{2}{9}}$.
There are two possible colors for the first stripe, two possible colors for the second stripe, and two possible colors for the third stripe
Since the colors of each stripe are mutually exclusive, there are $2\times 2 \times 2 = \boxed{8}$ ways to color the flag.
The first 10 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29
The sum of four of these numbers is only odd if 2, the only even number on the list, is among them because the sum of four odd numbers is even
Once 2 is picked, there are $\binom{9}{3}=\frac{9!}{3!6!}=84$ ways to pick three numbers from the remaining nine
The total number of ways to select four prime numbers from the ten is $\binom{10}{4}=\frac{10!}{4!6!}=210$
Therefore, the probability that the sum of the four selected numbers is odd is $\frac{84}{210}=\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.
The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue
If the socks are white, there are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices
If the socks are brown, there are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices
If the socks are blue, there is $\binom{2}{2} = 1$ choice
So the total number of choices for socks is $6 + 6 + 1 = \boxed{13}$.
Each of the $\binom{9}{2} = 36$ pairs of vertices determines two equilateral triangles, for a total of 72 triangles
However, the three triangles $A_1A_4A_7$, $A_2A_5A_8$, and $A_3A_6A_9$ are each counted 3 times, resulting in an overcount of 6
Thus, there are $\boxed{66}$ distinct equilateral triangles.
For each integer $x$ in the list besides 5, the integer $10-x$ is also in the list
So, for each of these integers, removing $x$ reduces the number of pairs of distinct integers whose sum is 10
However, there is no other integer in list that can be added to 5 to give 10, so removing 5 from the list will not reduce the number of pairs of distinct integers whose sum is 10.
Since removing any integer besides 5 will reduce the number of pairs that add to 10, while removing 5 will leave the number of pairs that add to 10 unchanged, we have the highest probability of having a sum of 10 when we remove $\boxed{5}$.
Say our two-digit non-palindrome is $n=\overline{ab}=10a+b$, with $a$ and $b$ digits
Reversing $n$ and adding it to itself is $10a+b+10b+a=11(a+b)$
This operation only depends on $a+b$, so 57 and 48 for example yield the same result
When $a+b\le9$, the resulting number is just a number in $\{11,22,\ldots,99\}$, all of which are palindromes, so numbers with $a+b\le9$ take one step
We can now check how many times the operation needs to be applied on each remaining value of $a+b$
Since $a,b\le9$, $a+b\le18$
a+b=10 \rightarrow 110 \rightarrow 121
a+b=11 \rightarrow 121
a+b=12 \rightarrow 132 \rightarrow 363
a+b=13 \rightarrow 143 \rightarrow 484
a+b=14 \rightarrow 154 \rightarrow 605 \rightarrow 1111
a+b=15 \rightarrow 165 \rightarrow 726 \rightarrow 1353 \rightarrow 4884
a+b=16 \rightarrow 176 \rightarrow 847 \rightarrow 1595 \rightarrow 7546 \rightarrow 14003 \rightarrow 44044
a+b=17 \rightarrow 187 \rightarrow 968 \rightarrow 1837 \rightarrow 9218 \rightarrow 17347 \rightarrow 91718 \rightarrow \ldots
a+b=18 \rightarrow 198 \rightarrow 1089 \rightarrow 10890 \rightarrow 20691 \rightarrow 40293 \rightarrow 79497
\] The only two values of $a+b$ which require exactly six steps are $a+b=16$ and $a+b=18$
However, the only $n$ for which $a+b=18$ is $n=99$, a palindrome
We are left with $97+79=\boxed{176}$, as we exclude the palindrome $n=88$.
With no restrictions, we are merely picking 6 students out of 14
This is $\binom{14}{6} = \boxed{3003}$.
The shortest possible path from $A$ to $B$ requires $4$ dominoes, which is all we have, so we must use them to make only down and right movements - we have none to waste going up or left
We need to make $3$ movements to the right and $4$ down, and we can arrange them however we wish
So there are
$$\binom{7}{3}=\boxed{35}$$arrangements.
It is easy to see that each domino arrangement is one of the path mentioned above
To show every above mentioned path can be paved by the dominoes, color the table cells white and black alternatively
Then each path must also be white and black alternatively, thus can always be paved by the dominoes.
The expected value of one roll is the average of all the outcomes, or $E = \dfrac{1}{8}(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = \boxed{4.5}$.
The first letter can be G or K, so it has 2 choices
The last letter must be T, so it only has 1 choice
Since no element may repeat, the second letter has 9 choices, any of the 12 letters excluding the first letter, T, and S
Similarly, the third letter has 8 choices, and the fourth 7 choices
So, the number of license plates is $2 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 = \boxed{1008}$.
\begin{align*}
\dbinom{10}{5} &= \dfrac{10!}{5!5!} \\
&= \dfrac{10\times9\times 8\times 7\times 6}{5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1} \\
&= \dfrac{10}{5}\times \dfrac{9}{3} \times \dfrac{8}{4} \times \dfrac{7}{1} \times \dfrac{6}{2} \\
&= 2\times 3\times 2\times 7\times 3 \\
&= \boxed{252}.
\end{align*}
There are ${5 \choose 2} = 10$ pairs of contestants
Exactly ${3 \choose 2} = 3$ of these are female pairs
The probability that both of the final contestants are female is $\boxed{\frac{3}{10}}$.
Place Fluffy in the 3-dog group and Nipper in the 5-dog group
This leaves 8 dogs remaining to put in the last two spots of Fluffy's group, which can be done in $\binom{8}{2}$ ways
Then there are 6 dogs remaining for the last 4 spots in Nipper's group, which can be done in $\binom{6}{4}$ ways
The remaining 2-dog group takes the last 2 dogs
So the total number of possibilities is $\binom{8}{2} \times \binom{6}{4} = \boxed{420}$.
There are 7 possible locations for the books
The teacher can select 3 of these and place the copies of Introduction to Geometry in those spots and then place the copies of Introduction to Number Theory in the remaining 4 spots
This is just a combination, so our answer is $\binom{7}{3}=\boxed{35}$.
$\sqrt{3!\cdot3!}$ is equal to $\sqrt{(3!)^2}=3!=3\cdot2\cdot1=\boxed{6}$.
There are 2 different boxes, so each of the 5 balls can be placed in two different locations
So the answer is $2^5 = \boxed{32}$.
First we count the arrangements if the four A's are unique, which is $7!$
Then since the A's are not unique, we divide by $4!$ for the arrangements of A, for an answer of $\dfrac{7!}{4!} = \boxed{210}$.
There are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen
None of these numbers are multiples of 9, so in order for their product to be a multiple of 9, both numbers must be a multiple of 3
The only possible pair that satisfies this is 3 and 6
Thus, the probability is $\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$
Since $12^n = 2^{2n} \cdot 3^n$, we are looking for the largest value of $n$ such that $2^{2n}$ and $3^n$ are divisors of $20!$
$$ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \qquad \qquad \frac{10}{2} = 5 \qquad \qquad \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \qquad \qquad \frac{2}{2} = 1 $$ The largest power of 2 that divides $20!$ is $2^{(10 + 5 + 2 + 1)} = 2^{18}$
$$ \frac{20}{3} = 6 \frac{2}{3} \qquad \qquad \frac{6}{3} = 2 $$ The largest power of 3 that divides $20!$ is $3^{(6 + 2)} = 3^8$
Since there are 18 powers of 2 and 8 powers of 3 in $20!$, we want the largest value of $n$ such that $2n \le 18$ and $n \le 8$, so $\boxed{8}$ is the answer and $12^8$ is the largest power of 12 that divides $20!$.
George can choose 2 colors in $\binom{7}{2}=\boxed{21}$ ways.
The probability that both of two independent events will occur is the product of the probabilities of each event
Therefore, the probability that it will rain on both days is $(60\%)(25\%)=\frac{3}{5}\cdot\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{20}$
Multiplying the numerator and denominator of $3/20$ by $5$, we find that the probability that it will rain on both days is $\boxed{15}$ percent.
We don't have to worry about three of the rolls since there will be one of each kind
Now we look at the possible cases for the remaining three rolls.
$\emph{Case 1:}$ The remaining three rolls are one of each kind, for which there is only $\emph{1}$ combination.
$\emph{Case 2:}$ The remaining three rolls are all the same kind
Since there are three different kinds of rolls, there are $\emph{3}$ possibilities for this case.
$\emph{Case 3:}$ The remaining three rolls are two of one kind and one of another kind
We have three choices for the rolls we have two of, which leaves two choices for the rolls we have one of, and then one choice for the kind of roll we don't have
So there are $3!=\emph{6}$ possibilities for this case.
In total, we have $1+3+6=\boxed{10}$ possible combinations of rolls that Jack could purchase.
The light completes a cycle every 63 seconds
Leah sees the color change if and only if she begins to look within three seconds before the change from green to yellow, from yellow to red, or from red to green
Thus she sees the color change with probability $(3+3+3)/63=\boxed{\frac{1}{7}}$.
Consider the two different faces of each card as distinct items at first
Since we have two completely red cards and one half-red card, we have a total of 5 red card-sides
So, since we are looking at a red face, we know we have one of these 5 red card-sides
4 of these are located on a completely red card, and turning it over will reveal another red face
So the probability is $\boxed{\frac{4}{5}}$.
Since there are twelve steps between $(0,0)$ and $(5,7)$, $A$ and $B$ can meet only after they have each moved six steps
The possible meeting places are $P_{0} = (0,6)$, $P_{1} = (1,5)$, $P_{2} = (2,4)$, $P_{3}=(3,3)$, $P_{4} = (4,2)$, and $P_{5} =
(5,1)$
Let $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ denote the number of paths to $P_{i}$ from $(0,0)$ and $(5,7)$, respectively
Since $A$ has to take $i$ steps to the right and $B$ has to take $i+1$ steps down, the number of ways in which $A$ and $B$ can meet at $P_{i}$ is $$a_{i}\cdot b_{i} = \binom{6}{i} \binom{6}{i+1}
$$Since $A$ and $B$ can each take $2^{6}$ paths in six steps, the probability that they meet  is \begin{align*}
&\sum_{i = 0}^{5}\displaystyle\left ( \frac{a_{i}}{2^{6}}\displaystyle\right)\displaystyle\left( \frac{b_{i}}{2^{6}} \displaystyle\right) \\
& \qquad = \frac{\binom{6}{0}\binom{6}{1} + \binom{6}{1}\binom{6}{2} + \binom{6}{2}\binom{6}{3}
+ \binom{6}{3}\binom{6}{4}+ \binom{6}{4}\binom{6}{5} + \binom{6}{5}\binom{6}{6}}{2^{12}}\\
& \qquad = \frac{99}{512} \\
& \qquad \approx \boxed{0.20}.
\end{align*}
$\dbinom{n}{1}=\dfrac{n!}{1!(n-1)!}=\boxed{n}$
Also, $\binom{n}{1}$ is the number of ways to choose 1 object out of $n$
Since there are $n$ different objects, there are $\boxed{n}$ ways to do this.
There are 13 ways to choose the first card to be a $\spadesuit$, then 12 ways to choose the second card to be another $\spadesuit$, then 11 ways to choose the third card to be a $\spadesuit$
There are $52 \times 51 \times 50$ ways to choose any three cards
So the probability is $\dfrac{13 \times 12 \times 11}{52 \times 51 \times 50} = \boxed{\dfrac{11}{850}}$.
The number of all outfit combinations is $6\times 4\times 6=144$
There are 4 outfits in which all three items are the same color
Thus there are $144-4=\boxed{140}$ outfits in which not all three items are the same color.
There are $\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ ways to choose $k$ objects from a group of $n$ distinct objects, so $\binom{6}{4}=\frac{6!}{4!2!}=\frac{6\cdot5}{2}=\boxed{15}$ four-member committees may be formed from a group of six students.
There are 4 exclusive cases:
Case 1: first card not a $\clubsuit$ and second card not a 2.
There are 3 cards that are 4's but not a $\clubsuit$, so the probability for the first card is $\dfrac{3}{52}$
Next, there are 12 $\clubsuit$s remaining that aren't a 2, so the probability for the second card is $\dfrac{12}{51}$
Finally, there are four 2's remaining, so the probability for the third card is $\dfrac{4}{50}$
Hence, this case gives a probability of $\dfrac{3}{52}\times \dfrac{12}{51}\times \dfrac{4}{50} = \dfrac{144}{132600}$
(We leave the fraction in these terms rather than reducing because we know that we're going to need to add fractions later.)
Case 2: first card not a $\clubsuit$ and second card the 2$\clubsuit$.
There are 3 cards that are 4's but not a $\clubsuit$, so the probability for the first card is $\dfrac{3}{52}$
Next, there is only one 2$\clubsuit$, so the probability for the second card is $\dfrac{1}{51}$
Finally, there are three 2's remaining, so the probability for the third card is $\dfrac{3}{50}$
Hence, this case gives a probability of $\dfrac{3}{52}\times \dfrac{1}{51}\times \dfrac{3}{50} = \dfrac{9}{132600}$.
Case 3: first card the 4$\clubsuit$ and second card not a 2.
There is only one 4$\clubsuit$, so the probability for the first card is $\dfrac{1}{52}$
Next, there are 11 $\clubsuit$s remaining that aren't a 2, so the probability for the second card is $\dfrac{11}{51}$
Finally, there are four 2's remaining, so the probability for the third card is $\dfrac{4}{50}$
Hence, this case gives a probability of $\dfrac{1}{52}\times \dfrac{11}{51}\times \dfrac{4}{50} = \dfrac{44}{132600}$.
Case 4: first card the 4$\clubsuit$ and second card the 2$\clubsuit$.
There is only one 4$\clubsuit$, so the probability for the first card is $\dfrac{1}{52}$
Next, there is only one 2$\clubsuit$, so the probability for the second card is $\dfrac{1}{51}$
Finally, there are three 2's remaining, so the probability for the third card is $\dfrac{3}{50}$
Hence, this case gives a probability of $\dfrac{1}{52}\times \dfrac{1}{51}\times \dfrac{3}{50} = \dfrac{3}{132600}$.
So the overall probability is $\dfrac{144+9+44+3}{132600} = \dfrac{200}{132600} = \boxed{\frac{1}{663}}$.
To form a four-digit number using 2, 0, 0 and 4, the digit in the thousands place must be 2 or 4
There are three places available for the remaining nonzero digit, whether it is 4 or 2
So the final answer is $\boxed{6}$.
If the first chip drawn is blue, there is a probability of 7/12 of drawing a chip which isn't blue second
If the first chip drawn is red, there is a probability of 8/12 of drawing a chip which isn't red second
And if the first chip is yellow, there is a 9/12 probability of drawing a chip which isn't yellow second
So, the probability that the two selected chips are different colors is $\frac{5}{12}\cdot\frac{7}{12} + \frac{4}{12}\cdot\frac{8}{12} + \frac{3}{12}\cdot\frac{9}{12} = \frac{(35+32+27)}{144} = \frac{94}{144} = \boxed{\frac{47}{72}}$.
Consider the number of people that can fill each place in line
There are three people who could be first (the youngest is excluded)
There are then three people who could be second, two people who could be third, and the last is determined
Thus, there are $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = \boxed{18}$ ways in which to form a line.
We have two cases because if the first card is a $\diamondsuit$, it could be an ace or not be an ace.
There is a $\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the ace of $\diamondsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{3}{51} = \dfrac{1}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the three remaining aces, which gives a probability of $\dfrac{1}{52}\cdot \dfrac{1}{17} = \dfrac{1}{884}$ chance that this occurs.
There is a $\dfrac{12}{52} = \dfrac{3}{13}$ chance that a $\diamondsuit$ other than the ace is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{4}{51}$ chance that an ace is drawn second, giving a $\dfrac{3}{13}\cdot \dfrac{4}{51} = \dfrac{4}{221}$ chance that this occurs.
So the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\dfrac{1}{884} + \dfrac{4}{221} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{52}}$.
Notice that we can avoid some of the large denominators above by organizing this computation as follows: $$\dfrac{1}{52}\cdot\dfrac{3}{51}+\dfrac{12}{52}\cdot\dfrac{4}{51} = \dfrac{1\cdot 3+12\cdot 4}{52\cdot 51} = \dfrac{51}{52\cdot 51}=\boxed{\dfrac{1}{52}}.$$
There's a $\dfrac{1}{3}$ chance that I will select each team
Once I have selected a team, let $n$ be the number of students on that team
There are $\dbinom{n}{2}$ ways to choose a pair of those students to give books to, but only one of those pairs will be the two co-captains, which means that once I have selected that team, the probability that I give books to the co-captains is $$\dfrac{1}{\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}}=\dfrac{2}{n(n-1)}.$$Since the teams have $5,$ $7,$ and $8$ students, this means that the total probability is $$\dfrac{1}{3}\left(\dfrac{2}{5(5-1)}+\dfrac{2}{7(7-1)}+\dfrac{2}{8(8-1)}\right)$$which after a bit of arithmetic simplifies to $\boxed{\dfrac{11}{180}}$.
Because of the restrictions, the frogs must be grouped by color, which gives two possibilities: green, blue, red, or red, blue, green
For each of these possibilities, there are $3!$ ways to arrange the red frogs and $2!$ ways to arrange the green frogs.
Therefore, the answer is $2\times2!\times3!=\boxed{24}$ ways.
The spinner is guaranteed to land on exactly one of the three regions, so we know that the sum of the probabilities of it landing in each region will be 1
If we let the probability of it landing in region $C$ be $x$, we then have the equation $1 = \frac{5}{12}+\frac{1}{3}+x$, from which we have $x=\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
First we find the total number of elements in the first $15$ rows
The first row of Pascal's Triangle has one element, the second row has two, and so on
The first $15$ rows thus have $1+2+\cdots+15$ elements
Instead of manually adding the summands, we can find the sum by multiplying the average of the first and last term $\frac{1+15}{2}$ by the number of terms, $15$
The sum is $\frac{16}{2}\cdot15=8\cdot15=120$, so there are $120$ elements
Now we find the number of ones in the first $15$ rows
Each row except the first has two ones, and the first row only has one
So there are $14\cdot2+1=29$ ones
With $29$ ones among the $120$ possible elements we could choose, the probability is $\boxed{\frac{29}{120}}$.
A customer makes one of two choices for each condiment, to include it or not to include it
The choices are made independently, so there are $2^8 = 256$ possible combinations of condiments
For each of those combinations there are three choices regarding the number of meat patties, so there are altogether $(3)(256)=\boxed{768}$ different kinds of hamburgers.
The number of ways for the outcome to have exactly 0, 1, or 2 heads are $\binom{8}{0}=1$, $\binom{8}{1}=8$, or $\binom{8}{2}=28$, respectively
There are $2^8$ total possible outcomes (2 possibilities for each coin, and 8 coins)
So the answer is $\dfrac{1+8+28}{2^8}=\boxed{\dfrac{37}{256}}$.
The solutions are $(1,29),(2,28),\ldots,(28,2),(29,1)$
Each $a$ produces a unique $b$, and since there are 29 possibilities for $a$, there are $\boxed{29}$ possibilities for $(a,b)$.
The chances of getting an odd or even number are equal, so there are $2^5=32$ equally likely outcomes
If we want to get exactly 4 of 5 the rolls to be odd, the probability is $\dfrac{\binom{5}{4}}{2^5}=\boxed{\dfrac{5}{32}}.$
There are 3 choices for the offensive lineman position
Then there are 9 choices for the next position, 8 choices for the  position after, and 7 choices for the last position
So that's a total of $3\times9\times8\times7 = \boxed{1512}$.
The probability that the first letter selected will be from Cybil's name, and the second from Ronda's name, will be $\frac{5}{10}\cdot \frac{5}{9}=\frac{5}{18}$
Similarly, the probability that the first letter will be from Ronda's name, and the second from Cybil's name, is also $\frac{5}{10}\cdot \frac{5}{9}=\frac{5}{18}$
The probability that one letter will be selected from each name is then $\frac{5}{18}+\frac{5}{18}=\boxed{\frac{5}{9}}$.
Call a triangle with side length 1 toothpick a 1-triangle
The figure contains 10 upward-pointing 1-triangles and 6 downward-pointing 1-triangles
Removing a toothpick destroys at most one upward-pointing 1-triangle, so we must remove at least 10 toothpicks
Any triangle must have at least one horizontal toothpick, so if we remove all $\boxed{10}$ horizontal toothpicks, no triangles remain
Since we have to remove at least 10, this is the minimum.
No $1\times1$ squares or $2\times2$ squares contain five black squares
Every square which is $4\times4$ or larger does
However, a $3\times3$ square will only contain 5 black squares if its upper left corner is black
We can choose the upper left corner of a $3\times3$ square in $6\cdot6=36$ ways, but for only half of these squares will the upper left corner be black
Therefore, there are $36/2=18$ $3\times3$ squares containing at least 5 black squares
We can choose the position of the upper left square of a $4\times4$ square in $5\cdot5=25$ ways, so there are 25 $4\times4$ squares
Similarly, there are 16 $5\times5$ squares, 9 $6\times6$ squares, 4 $7\times7$ squares and 1 $8\times8$ square
There are a total of $18+25+16+9+4+1=\boxed{73}$ squares containing at least 5 black squares.
There are $\binom{10}{1}$ ways to roll exactly one 1 out of 10 dice
The probability of any one of these occurring is $\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{\!1}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{\!9}$
So the overall probability is \[ \binom{10}{1}\bigg(\frac{1}{6}\bigg)^{\!1}\bigg(\frac{5}{6}\bigg)^{\!9}=\frac{10\times 5^9}{6^{10}} \approx \boxed{0.323}
Since the two events are independent, we consider each separately
The probability of the tile from A being less than 15 is equal to $\frac{14}{20} = \frac{7}{10}$
The probability of a tile from B being even or greater than 25 is $\frac{10+2}{20} = \frac{3}{5}$
So we multiply the probabilities for the independent events, giving us probability $\frac{7}{10} \cdot \frac{3}{5} = \boxed{\frac{21}{50}}$.
To form a triangle, we must choose 3 of the 7 points to be the vertices
So, selecting 3 points (without concern for order) out of 7 we get ${7 \choose 3} = \frac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \boxed{35}$ triangles.
First, consider arranging the four basil plants and the one group of tomato plants (not worrying about the order of the tomato plants within the group)
There are $5!=120$ ways to arrange them
Then, for each arrangement, there are $4!=24$ ways to arrange the plants in the group of tomato plants
Therefore, there are a total of $120\cdot24=\boxed{2880}$ ways for April to arrange her plants such that all the tomato plants are next to each other.
In one flip, we have a $1/3$ chance of getting heads and winning 3 dollars, and a $2/3$ chance of getting tails and losing 2 dollars
So the expected value of one flip is $E = \frac{1}{3}(\$3) + \frac{2}{3}(-\$2) = \boxed{-\frac{1}{3}}$.
There are nine numbers with one digit: $1,2,...,9$, so the probability of selecting a one digit number is $\frac{9}{12} =\frac{3}{4}$
There are three numbers with two digits: $10,11,12$, so the probability of selecting a two digit number is $\frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}$
The expected number of digits is therefore $E = \frac{3}{4} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 = \boxed{1.25}$.
Each number from 1 to 6 has probability $\dfrac{1}{6}$ of being rolled, so the expected value is \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{6}(6-1)&+\frac{1}{6}(6-2)+\frac{1}{6}(6-3)+\frac{1}{6}(6-4)+\frac{1}{6}(6-5)+\frac{1}{6}(6-6) \\
&= \frac{1}{6}(5+4+3+2+1+0)=\frac{15}{6}\\
&=\$\boxed{2.50}.
\end{align*}
$\dbinom{16}{5}=\dfrac{16\times 15\times 14\times 13\times 12}{5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1}=\boxed{4368}.$
There are $\binom{5}{3}=\boxed{10}$ ways to choose three socks from the drawer.
The number of all seating arrangements is $7!$
The number of seating arrangements in which Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\times 2!$
(We can arrive at $6!\times 2!$ by pretending Wilma and Paul together are one person, WilmaPaul, and that we have 6 chairs
We then have 6 people, who we can seat in $6!$ ways
We then must break WilmaPaul back into two people, which we can do in $2!$ ways, one for each order of the two -- Wilma then Paul, and Paul then Wilma
That gives us a total of $6!\times 2!$ ways to arrange the people with Wilma and Paul together.)  Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $7!-6!\times 2!=\boxed{3600}$.
Each game played removes one team from the tournament
Since we seek to remove 16 teams from the tournament, we must play $\boxed{16}$ games.
There are 10 pairs of integers that we can potentially select
The easiest way to do this is to simply write them all out: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5)
The 4 pairs with 1 as an element all obviously work, as does (2,4), but none of the others do
That means that 5 out of 10 pairs work which gives us a probability of $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing
To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person
This suggests that there are $6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people
However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count
Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table
There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\cdot 5! = \boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.
The region that the point $(x,y,z)$ can lie in is a cube with side length 2
It has total volume of $2^3=8$
The region of points that satisfy $x^2+y^2+z^2\le 1$ corresponds to a unit sphere centered at the origin
The volume of this sphere is $\frac{4\pi}{3}\cdot 1^3=\frac{4\pi}{3}$
This sphere lies completely inside, and is tangent to, the cube
The probability that a point randomly selected from the cube will lie inside this sphere is equal to $\frac{\frac{4\pi}{3}}{8}=\boxed{\frac{\pi}{6}}$.
There are 90 choices for a two-digit positive integer
Of these, all of the integers $n<64$ satisfy $\sqrt{n} < 8$
So, $n$ can be chosen from the set $\{ 10, 11, 12, \ldots , 63\}$ which has 54 members
So the probability is $\frac{54}{90} = \boxed{\frac{3}{5}}$.
Because we are replacing the cards, at each draw, there is a $\frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4}$ probability of ending up with a card from any given suit
Because we are looking for one card from each of the four suits, it doesn't matter what suit the first card drawn represents
After one card is drawn and replaced, the probability that the second card drawn wil $\textit{not}$ be from the same suit as the first card is $\frac{3}{4}$
Similarly, after two cards have been drawn and replaced, the probability that the third card drawn will not be from either of the suits of the first two cards is $\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$
Finally, the probability that the fourth card drawn will not be from any of the same suits of the first three cards that were drawn and replaced is $\frac{1}{4}$
Thus, our final probability is $\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{\frac{3}{32}}$.
There are $10^3 = 1000$ possible codes without restrictions
There are $3\cdot 9 = 27$ codes that differ in only one spot from mine (three choices for the differing digit and nine choices for its value), 3 codes that result from transposing two digits (have three choices for the fixed digits), and Reckha also can't use my code itself
Thus Reckha has a total of $1000-27-3-1 = \boxed{969}$ available codes.
We see that $$\left(\sqrt{4!\cdot 3!}\right)^2 = 4!\cdot 3! = 24\cdot 6 = \boxed{144}.$$
A five-digit palindrome has digits in the form $abcba$
Since the first digit cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for $a$
There are 10 choices for each of $b$ and $c$
Each different choice of $a$, $b$, and $c$ creates a distinct five-digit palindrome, so there are a total of $9 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 = \boxed{900}$ of them.
We will calculate the probability that Sam can buy his favorite toy just using his 8 quarters and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that we're looking for
There are a total of $8!$ orders in which the 8 toys can be dispensed
If his favorite toy is the first one that the machine selects, then he can obviously buy it just using his quarters, and then there are $7!$ order in which the other toys can be dispensed, which gives us 7! orderings of the toys that let him buy his favorite just using the quarters
If the first toy is the one that only costs 25 cents, then he will be able to buy his favorite toy just using his remaining quarters if and only if it is the second one dispensed
If those are the first two toys dispensed, there are $6!$ ways to order the other toys which means that we have another $6!$ orderings of the toys that allow him to buy his favorite toy without getting change for the 10 dollar bill
If the first toy costs more than 25 cents, or if two toys are dispensed before his favorite one, then he won't have enough quarters to buy his favorite one without getting change for his ten dollar bill
So out of the $8!$ orders in which the 8 toys can be dispensed, there are $7! + 6!$ ways that allow him to buy his favorite toy just using his quarters for a probability of $\dfrac{7!+6!}{8!}=\dfrac{6!}{6!}\cdot\dfrac{7+1}{8\cdot7}=\dfrac{1}{7}$
But that is the probability that what we want $\emph{doesn't}$ happen, so we need to subtract it from 1 to get our final probability of $1-\dfrac{1}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{6}{7}}$.
There are two cases.
Case 1: The first card is a $\heartsuit$ but not a 10.
The probability of the first card satisfying this is $\dfrac{12}{52},$ and then the probability that the second card is a 10 is $\dfrac{4}{51}.$
Case 2: The first card is the 10 $\heartsuit$.
The probability of the first card being the 10 $\heartsuit$ is $\dfrac{1}{52},$ and then the probability that the second card is a 10 is $\dfrac{3}{51}.$
We then add the probability of the two cases (since they are exclusive) to get \[\frac{12}{52}\times \frac{4}{51}+\frac{1}{52}\times \frac{3}{51}=\boxed{\frac{1}{52}}.\]
The probability that a fair coin lands heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips is $p_1=\binom{3}{2}(1/2)^2(1/2)=3/8$
The probability that a fair coin lands heads up 3 times out of 3 flips is $p_2=(1/2)^3=1/8$
Finally, we have $p_1-p_2=2/8=\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
$$\dbinom{5}{3} = \dfrac{5!}{3!2!}=\dfrac{(5\times 4)(3\times 2\times 1)}{(3\times 2\times 1)(2\times 1)}=\dfrac{5\times 4}{2\times 1}=\boxed{10}.$$
We're really looking for the remainder when $8^{25}+12^{25}$ is divided by 100
Notice that $8=10-2$ and $12=10+2$
Then notice that the $k^{th}$ term of the expansion of $(10+2)^{25}$ is, by the binomial theorem, $\binom{25}{k} \cdot 10^{25-k} \cdot 2^k$
Similarly, the $k^{th}$ term of the expansion of $(10-2)^{25}$ is, by the binomial theorem, $\binom{25}{k} \cdot 10^{25-k} \cdot (-2)^k = (-1)^k \cdot \binom{25}{k} \cdot 10^{25-k} \cdot 2^k$, which is the same as the $k^{th}$ term of $(10+2)^{25}$ for $k$ even, and the negative of the $k^{th}$ term of $(10+2)^{25}$ for $k$ odd
So, if we add together the $k^{th}$ terms of the expansions of $(10-2)^{25}$ and $(10+2)^{25}$, we get double the value of the $k^{th}$ term of the expansion of $(10+2)^{25}$, that is, $2 \cdot \binom{25}{k} \cdot 10^{25-k} \cdot 2^k$, if $k$ is even, and 0 if $k$ is odd
So, $8^{25}+12^{25}$ is the sum of all terms of the form $2 \cdot \binom{25}{k} \cdot 10^{25-k} \cdot 2^k$ for $0 \leq k \leq 25$, $k$ even
But notice that this is divisible by 100 for $k<24$, and because we care only about the remainder when dividing by 100, we can ignore such terms
This means we care only about the term where $k=24$
This term is $$2 \cdot \binom{25}{24} \cdot 10^1 \cdot 2^{24} = 2 \cdot 25 \cdot 10 \cdot 2^{24} = 500 \cdot 2^{24},$$which is also divisible by 100
So, $8^{25}+12^{25}$ is divisible by 100
So the sum of the last two digits is $0+0=\boxed{0}.$
We consider the unordered pairs, or sets, of spins for which the difference of the numbers are greater than or equal to 3, or those games which Jane loses
These can only occur in the sets $\{1, 4\}$, $\{1, 5 \}$ or $\{ 2, 5 \}$
Each of these unordered pairs can occur in 2 orderings (depending on whether Jane or her brother spins each number)
So, there are $2 \cdot 3 = 6$ losing combinations out of $5 \cdot 5 = 25$ for Jane
So, her winning probability is $1 - \frac{6}{25} = \boxed{\frac{19}{25}}$.
We can divide this into cases.
$\bullet$  Case 1: All $4$ items go in the same bag
There is one possible way to do this.
$\bullet$  Case 2: Three items go in one bag, and the last item goes in another bag
There are $\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways to choose which item goes in a bag by itself.
$\bullet$  Case 3: Two items go in one bag, and the other two go in another bag
There are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which items go in the first bag, but since the bags are identical we must divide by $2$ to correct for overcounting
Therefore, there are $3$ arrangements in this case.
$\bullet$  Case 4: Two items go in one bag, and the other two items each go in a different one of the remaining bags
There are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two items are put in a bag together, and since the bags are identical it doesn't matter which bags the last two items are put in.
There are a total of $1+4+3+6=\boxed{14}$ different ways to put the items into bags.
Rolling two dice has $6 \times 6=36$ possible outcomes
The only perfect squares that we can roll are 4 and 9
Pairs adding up to 4 are 1+3, 2+2, and 3+1
Those that add up to 9 are 3+6, 4+5, 5+4, and 6+3
The answer is $\boxed{\dfrac{7}{36}}$.
The probability that $P$ lies within one unit of the origin is the same as the probability that $P$ lies inside the unit circle centered at the origin, since this circle is by definition the set of points of distance 1 from the origin.
defaultpen(1);
draw((-2,-2)--(-2,2)--(2,2)--(2,-2)--cycle);
draw(circle((0,0),1));
fill(circle((0,0),1),gray(.7));
[/asy]
Since the unit circle centered at the origin lies inside our square, the probability we seek is the area of the circle divided by the area of the square
Since the circle has radius 1, its area is $\pi(1^2) = \pi$
Since the square has side length 4, its area is $4^2 = 16$
Therefore the probability in question is $\boxed{\frac{\pi}{16}}$.
There are $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ different pairs of marbles can be drawn, and the expected value of the sum is the average of the sums of each pair
This is  \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{10}((1+2)+(1+3)+(1+4)+(1+5)+(2+3)&\\
+(2+4)+(2+5)+(3+4)+(3+5)+(4+5))&=\frac{60}{10} = \boxed{6}
\end{align*}
The two-digit primes less than 40 are 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37
Thus there are $8$ choices for the two-digit prime $AB$
Since $AB$ and $CD$ must be distinct, there are $7$ remaining choices for $CD$
Altogether, there are $8\cdot 7 = \boxed{56}$ choices for $AB$ and $CD$.
Since on each day a given student is either absent or not absent we know that the sum of the probabilities of those two events is 1, which means that the probability of a given student being present on a particular day is $1-\frac{1}{30}=\frac{29}{30}$
There are two ways in which we can have one student there and the other one not there: either the first one is there and the second one isn't which will occur with probability $\frac{29}{30}\cdot\frac{1}{30}=\frac{29}{900}$ or the first one will be absent and the second one will be present which occurs with probability $\frac{1}{30}\cdot\frac{29}{30}=\frac{29}{900}$
The sum of these gives us the desired probability: $\frac{29}{900}+\frac{29}{900}=\frac{58}{900}=.06444...$, which, as a percent rounded to the nearest tenth, gives us our answer of $\boxed{6.4}$.
There are a total of $6!$ ways to order the 6 lectures with no restriction
By symmetry, exactly half of these will have Dr
Jones's lecture before Dr
Smith's lecture
Thus there are $6!/2 = \boxed{360}$ ways to schedule the conference.
$\dbinom{16}{15}=\dbinom{16}{1}=\boxed{16}.$
We will consider these by the cases of what our first shoe selection is
If our first shoe is black, which happens with probability $\frac{12}{22}$, then our second shoe will be black and for the opposite foot with probability $\frac{6}{21}$
Likewise, for brown shoes, our probability is the product $\frac{6}{22} \cdot \frac{3}{21}$
And for gray, $\frac{4}{22} \cdot \frac{2}{21}$
So the sum is equal to $\frac{12\cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 2}{22 \cdot 21} = \frac{98}{33\cdot 14} = \boxed{\frac{7}{33}}$.
There are 5 steps to the right, and 4 steps up
These 9 steps can be made in any order, so we can choose 4 of the 9 steps to be "up" in $\binom{9}{4} = \boxed{126}$ ways.
Seven of the boxes contain at least this amount
If a participant is going to be holding one of these boxes with a probability of $1/2,$ there can be at most $7$ other boxes left
This means that at least $26-7-7=\boxed{12}$ boxes must be eliminated.
The smallest triangles in the figure are the right triangles with legs equal to one-half the width and one-quarter the length of the large rectangle; there are 16 of these
Putting two of these triangles together yields either the isosceles triangle with base equal to the width of the rectangle (4 of these), or half the length of the rectangle (6 of these)
Putting these two triangles together yield the large right triangle with legs equal to the width and half the base (8 of these), and combining two large right triangles gives the large isosceles triangle with base equal to the full width of the rectangle (2 of these)
In all, this gives $\boxed{36}$ triangles
(Since the basic unit of the figure is the small right triangle, and other triangles can only be made up of 1, 2, 4, or 8 of these triangles, we know we have found all possible triangles.)
The fact that the number is odd means that the last digit can only be a $1$, $3$, $5$, $7$, or $9$
So there are $5$ choices for the units digit
There are nine potential choices for the hundreds-place digit ($1$, $2$, $\ldots$ , $9$), but we know that we've used one of these numbers for the units digit, so, since our digits must be distinct, we subtract one off for $8$ total choices for the hundreds digit
Finally, the tens-place digit can be anything from $0$ to $9$, minus the two digits we've used already, leaving $8$ choices for the tens digit
Thus, there are $5\cdot 8 \cdot 8 = \boxed{320}$ such numbers.
Since we are partitioning 81 into sums of perfect squares, we proceed by subtracting out perfect squares and seeing which work: $81 - 64 = 17 = 16 + 1$
Further, $81 - 49 = 32 = 16+ 16$
And finally, $81 - 36 = 45 = 36 + 9$
Although there is more to check through, this sort of method should convince us that these are the only $\boxed{3}$ solutions: $1^2 + 4^2 + 8^2 = 81$, $4^2 + 4^2 + 7^2 = 81$, and $3^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 = 81$.
First we choose the goalie, and any of the 16 people can be the goalie
Then we choose 10 more players from the remaining 15 players, which is the same as choosing a committee
The answer is \[16\binom{15}{10}=16\binom{15}{5}=16\times\frac{15\times 14\times 13\times 12\times 11}{5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1}=\boxed{48,\!048}.\]
There are $\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose 2 of 5 questions to give a positive response to
For each choice, there is a probability of $\left( \frac{2}{5} \right)^2 \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^3$ that those 2 questions will yield a positive answer and the other 3 will not
Therefore, the total probability that exactly 2 of questions give a positve answer is $10 \left( \frac{2}{5} \right)^2 \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^3 = \boxed{\frac{216}{625}}$.
We can solve this problem by dividing it into cases
If Alice tosses the baseball to Bob on the first turn, there is a 2/5 chance that Bob will toss it back to her on the next turn
On the other hand, if Alice keeps the baseball on the first turn, there is a 1/2 chance that she will also keep it on the second turn
The total probability is then $\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{2}{5} + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\boxed{\frac{9}{20}}$.
We can apply Pascal's identity to get that $\binom{19}{9}=\binom{18}{8}+\binom{18}{9}$
From here, we can apply it twice more to get that  $\binom{19}{9}=\binom{18}{8}+\binom{18}{9}=\left(\binom{17}{7}+\binom{17}{8}\right)+\left(\binom{17}{8}+\binom{17}{9}\right)$
Substituting the provided values of $\binom{17}{7}$, $\binom{17}{8}$, and $\binom{17}{9}$ gives us $\binom{19}{9}=19448+2(24310)+24310=\boxed{92378}$.
To get from A to B, four moves are required: two down and two to the right
This problem can be thought of as asking how many ways there are to arrange the order of the four moves
Think of a downward move as the letter ``D" and a move to the right as the letter ``R"
So, we are trying to count the total number of four-letter words formed with two Ds and two Rs
To do so, we can simply count the number of ways to arrange the Ds (the other slots will be automatically filled in with Rs)
So, there are $4$ slots in which the first D could go, and three in which the second could
However, we must divide by $2$ for over-counting because the Ds are indistinct
Thus, there are $\frac{4 \cdot 3}{2} = \boxed{6}$ different routes.
Among the 29 equally likely possibilities for Margo's partner, Irma is one of them
Therefore, the probability that Margo's partner is Irma is $\boxed{\frac{1}{29}}$.
$\dbinom{133}{133}=\dbinom{133}{0}=\boxed{1}.$
Because the women are of different heights, any handshake will take place between two people, one of whom is taller than the other
Of course, the shorter of the two will not participate in the handshake because her handshake partner is not shorter than herself
Applying this logic to all of the pairs, there are $\boxed{0}$ handshakes.
Look at the coefficients of the powers of 101: 1, -4, 6, -4, 1
You might recognize these as $\binom40$, $-\binom41$, $\binom42$, $-\binom43$, $\binom44$
This suggests that the Binomial Theorem is in play
Indeed, we have
\begin{align*}
(101 + (-1))^4 &= \binom40 \cdot 101^{4} \cdot (-1)^0 + \binom41 \cdot 101^{3} \cdot (-1)^1 + \\
&\phantom{=} \binom42 \cdot 101^2 \cdot (-1)^2 + \binom43 \cdot 101^1 \cdot (-1)^3 + \\
&\phantom{=} \binom44 \cdot 101^0 \cdot (-1)^4\\
& = 101^{4} - 4 \cdot 101^{3} + 6 \cdot 101^2 - 4 \cdot 101 + 1.
\end{align*}
Therefore, we have $(101 + (-1))^4 = 100^4 = \boxed{100000000}$.
If all four of the dots are collinear, it is obvious that it must either be a horizontal line of dots, a vertical line of dots, or a diagonal line of dots
And inspection tells us that there are $4 + 4 + 2 = 10$ such collinear sets of 4
And in total, there are ${16 \choose 4} = \frac{16\cdot 15 \cdot 14 \cdot 13}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 13 \cdot 14 = 1820$
So, the probability is $\frac{10}{1820} = \boxed{\frac{1}{182}}$.
We can use complementary probability to determine that the probability of its not raining tomorrow is $1 - \frac{3}{10} = \boxed{\frac{7}{10}}$.
The only time the two numbers selected will not have a positive difference which is 2 or greater is when the two numbers are consecutive
There are 6 pairs of consecutive numbers in the set $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$, and there are $\binom{7}{2}=21$ pairs of numbers total
So, the probability that the pair of numbers chosen is not consecutive is $1-\frac{6}{21}=\frac{15}{21}=\boxed{\frac{5}{7}}$.
The denominator can be simplified a bit to make this easier to calculate:
\begin{align*}
\frac{11!}{9! + 2\cdot 8!} &= \frac{11!}{9\cdot 8! + 2\cdot 8!} \\
&= \frac{11!}{11\cdot 8!} \\
&= \frac{10!}{8!} \\
&= 10 \cdot 9 \\
&= \boxed{90}
\end{align*}
The longest side cannot be greater than 3, since otherwise the remaining two sides would not be long enough to form a triangle
The only possible triangles have side lengths $1$--$3$--$3$ or $2$--$2$--$3$
Hence the answer is $\boxed{2}.$
First, we can find the denominator of our fraction
There are a total of $\dbinom{18}{3}=816$ ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18
To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of silverware
There are 6 ways we could choose a fork, 6 ways to choose a spoon, and 6 ways to choose a knife, making a total of $6\cdot 6 \cdot 6=216$ ways to choose a fork, a knife, and a spoon so our final probability is $\frac{216}{816}=\boxed{\frac{9}{34}}$.
There are 5 green balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a green ball is drawn is $\dfrac{5}{5+k}$
Similarly, the probability that a purple ball is drawn is $\dfrac{k}{5+k}$
So the expected value is $$\frac{5}{5+k}(2)+\frac{k}{5+k}(-2)=\frac{1}{2}$$.
Multiplying both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ gives $20-4k=5+k$, or $15=5k$
Therefore, $\boxed{k=3}$.
For each student, the professor has 3 choices, so altogether, the professor has $3^{10} = \boxed{59049}$ ways to assign the grades.
The height in millimeters of any stack with an odd number of coins has a 5 in the hundredth place
The height of any two coins has an odd digit in the tenth place and a zero in the hundredth place
Therefore any stack with zeros in both its tenth and hundredth places must consist of a number of coins that is a multiple of 4
The highest stack of 4 coins has a height of $4(1.95)= 7.8 \; \text{mm}$, and the shortest stack of 12 coins has a height of $12(1.35)= 16.2 \; \text{mm}$, so no number other than $\boxed{8}$ can work
Note that a stack of 8 quarters has a height of $8(1.75)= 14\; \text{mm}$.
In this problem, we only need to count the number of ways to split 4 items into two groups
There are only 3 ways: $\{4,0\}$, $\{3,1\}$ and $\{2,2\}$
Therefore, there are only $\boxed{3}$ ways to put 4 indistinguishable balls in 2 indistinguishable boxes.
The first and last digits must be both odd or both even for their average to be an integer
There are $5\cdot 5 =25$ odd-odd combinations for the first and last digits
There are $4\cdot 5=20$ even-even combinations that do not use zero as the first digit
Hence, the total is $\boxed{45}$.
There are 10 choices for the chief
For each choice, there are 9 ways to choose supporting chief A, then 8 ways to choose supporting chief B
There are then $\binom{7}{2}$ ways to choose the inferior officers for the supporting chief A and $\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose the inferior officers for the supporting chief B
This gives us a total of $10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot \binom{7}{2}\cdot\binom{5}{2} = \boxed{151200}$ ways to form the leadership of the tribe.
It may not be obvious how to proceed with this problem, but a little experimentation might lead you to determine the possible values of $m.$
Since $0 < m^2 < 22,$ we can see that $m$ must be one of $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ or $4.$ So let's use these as our cases.
Case 1: When $m=1$, we must have $n < 22-1 = 21.$ Thus there are $20$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=1.$
Case 2: When $m=2,$ we must have $n < 22-4 = 18.$ Thus there are $17$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=2.$
Case 3: When $m=3,$ we must have $n < 22-9 = 13.$ Thus there are $12$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=3.$
Case 4: When $m=4,$ we must have $n < 22-16 = 6.$ Thus there are $5$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=4.$
So to get the total number of pairs of positive integers satisfying the inequality, we add up all of our possible cases, and see that there are $20 + 17 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{54}$ possible pairs.
Let's divide the problem into two cases: one where 0 or 1 T's fall off and one where both T's fall off:
0 or 1 T's: \[\dbinom{3}{2}\dbinom{6}{3}=3\times20=60\]
2 T's: \[\dbinom{3}{2}\dbinom{5}{1}=3\times5=15\]
Total: $60+15=\boxed{75}$
There are $6 \times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes
The only way that they can roll an odd product is if both their rolls are odd
Since 3 of the 6 faces on each die are odd, this can occur in $3 \times 3 = 9$ ways
So a even product can occur in $36-9= 27$ ways, and the probability is thus $\dfrac{27}{36} = \boxed{\dfrac34}$.
We put the time the train arrives on the $y$-axis and the time  Alex arrives on the $x$-axis, and shade in the region where Alex arrives while the train is there.
fill((0,0)--(60,60)--(60,50)--(10,0)--cycle, gray(.7));
draw((0,0)--(60,0), Arrow);
draw((0,0)--(0,60), Arrow);
label("1:00", (0,0), SW);
label("2:00", (60,0), S);
label("2:00", (0,60), W);
[/asy]
The probability that Alex arrives while the train is at the station is the ratio of the shaded area to the whole square
If we divide the axes into 60 units, the shaded region can be split up into a triangle of area 50 square units and a parallelogram of area 500 square units, and the whole square has an area of 3600 square units
The ratio is $550/3600=\boxed{\frac{11}{72}}$.
There are three choices for the first letter and two choices for each subsequent letter, so there are $3\cdot2^{n-1}\ n$-letter good words
Substitute $n=7$ to find there are $3\cdot2^6=\boxed{192}$ seven-letter good words.
Let $x$ be the number of students in the biology class who aren't in the chemistry class and $y$ be the number of students in the chemistry class who aren't in the biology class
Then, since all students are in either one of the classes or in both, we know that $43=x+y+5$
We also know that $3(x+5)=y+5$
Solving for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives us $y=3x+10$, and substituting that into the first equation gives us $43=x+(3x+10)+5$, which gives us $x=7$
Substituting this into the other equation gives us $y=31$
However, $y$ is only the number of chemistry students who aren't taking biology, so we need to add the number of students taking both to get our final answer of $\boxed{36}$.
By Pascal's Identity, we have $\binom{23}{4} + \binom{23}{5} = \binom{24}{5}$
However, we also have $\binom{24}{5} = \binom{24}{24-5} = \binom{24}{19}$
There are no other values of $k$ such that $\binom{24}{5} = \binom{24}{k}$, so the sum of all integers that satisfy the problem is $5+19 = \boxed{24}$.
Challenge: Is it a coincidence that the answer is 24?
The expected value is $$\frac{1}{10}(1) + \frac{1}{10}(2) + \frac{1}{10}(3) + \frac{1}{10}(4) + \frac{1}{10}(5) + \frac{1}{2}(6) = \frac{15}{10} + 3 = \boxed{4.5}
We count the number of ways to draw the tan chips consecutively, the pink chips consecutively, and the violet chips consecutively (although not necessarily in that order)
First of all, we can draw the tan chips in $3!$ ways, the pink chips in $2!$ ways, and the violet chips in $4!$ ways
We can choose our drawing order (e.g pink-tan-violet) in $3!$ ways
Thus we have $3!2!4!3!$ satisfying arrangements and $9!$ total ways of drawing the chips
So our answer is $\frac{3!2!4!3!}{9!} = \boxed{\frac{1}{210}}$.
Regardless of whether $x_1$ is odd or even, we have 5 choices for $x_2$: if $x_1$ is odd then $x_2$ must be one of the 5 even digits, otherwise if $x_1$ is even then $x_2$ must be one of the 5 odd digits
Similarly, we then have 5 choices for $x_3$, 5 choices for $x_4$, and so on.
Since $x_1$ can be any of the 10 digits, the answer is $10 \times 5^5=\boxed{31,250}.$
Consider the people around the table, sequentially, to be A, B, C and D
Now, with probability $\frac{1}{6}$, persons A and C, seated opposite one another, will roll the same number
In that case, each of B and D may roll any of 5 numbers not equal to the number rolled by both A and C
So the probability of no two consecutive persons rolling the same number in the case where A and C roll the same is $\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6}$
A and C roll differently with probability $\frac{5}{6}$, in which case each of B and D must choose from only 4 numbers, because A and C offer different numbers to be avoided
So, the probability then is $\frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{4}{6} \cdot \frac{4}{6}$
Adding the two cases gives $\frac{5(5 + 4 \cdot 4)}{6^3} = \frac{3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 36} = \boxed{\frac{35}{72}}$.
First, count the total number of possible sandwiches
There are four choices for bread, six for meat, and five for cheese, for a total of $4 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 = 120$ potential sandwiches
Discarding the ham / cheddar cheese combination will subtract four sandwiches (one for each type of bread)
Similarly, discarding the white bread / chicken combination will subtract five sandwiches, one for each kind of cheese
Thus, Al can order $120 - 4 - 5 = \boxed{111}$ different sandwiches.
Since a multiple of 100 must have 2 factors of 2 and 2 factors of 5, we can count the pairs by focusing on the factors of 5
For one thing, 50 can be paired with any number that has one factor of 2, since $50=2 \cdot 5^2$ takes care of all the other primes
So, 50 can be paired with 2, 4, 10, 12, and 20, for 5 pairs
Then, 20 can be paired with (excluding 50 which we already counted) 15 and 10, both of which have the necessary factor of 5, giving us 2 more pairs
There are no remaining pairs of numbers 15 and smaller that are multiples of 100, because the only pair with two factors of 5, $\{10, 15 \}$, lacks a factor of 2
So, there are $5+2 = 7$ pairs
And in total, there are ${7 \choose 2 } =21$ possible pairs, giving us a probability of $\frac{7}{21} = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
The probability that two coins land tails and five coins land heads, in some order, is $\left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^2 \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^5=\frac{9}{16384}$
Any two of the seven coins can be tails, so this can happen in $\binom{7}{2}=21$ ways
Therefore, the probability that exactly two coins come up tails is $21 \cdot \frac{9}{16384}=\boxed{\frac{189}{16384}}$.
None of $a,b,c$ are equal to 1 if and only if $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \neq 0$
$a,b,c$ can only be $2,3,4,5,6$
The probability of this is $\frac{5^3}{6^3}=\boxed{\frac{125}{216}}$.
A 5-digit number can have for its leftmost digit anything from 1 to 9 inclusive, and for each of its next four digits anything from 0 through 9 inclusive
Thus there are $9\times 10\times 10\times 10\times 10=90,\!000$ 5-digit numbers.
A 5-digit number with no zero as a digit can have for each of its five digits anything from 1 through 9 inclusive
There are $9\times 9\times 9\times 9\times 9=59,\!049$ such 5-digit numbers
Therefore the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one zero as a digit is  $90,\!000-59,\!049=\boxed{30,951}.$
We factor and rearrange the terms in the factorials:
\begin{align*}
\frac{3\cdot 5! + 15\cdot 4!}{6!} &= \frac{3\cdot 5! + 3\cdot 5!}{6!} \\
&= \frac{2\cdot 3 \cdot 5!}{6!} \\
&= \frac{6!}{6!} \\
&= \boxed{1}
\end{align*}
There are 26 ways to choose the repeated letter, $\binom{25}{2}$ ways to choose the other two letters, $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose in which two of the four positions to put the repeated letters, 2 ways to choose how to arrange the remaining two letters, 10 ways to choose the first digit and 9 ways to choose the second digit for a total of $(26)\binom{25}{2}\binom{4}{2}(2)(10)(9)=\boxed{8,\!424,\!000}$ combinations.
We could proceed by listing the various cases, depending on which number Mathew draws
\begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline
\text{Mathew's number} & \text{My pair of numbers} \\ \hline
1 & - \\ \hline
2 & - \\ \hline
3 & (1,2), (2,1) \\ \hline
4 & (1,3), (3,1) \\ \hline
5 & (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) \\ \hline
6 & (1,5), (2,4), (4,2), (5,1) \\ \hline
7 & (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) \\ \hline
8 & (2,6), (3,5), (5,3), (6,2) \\ \hline
9 & (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3) \\ \hline
10 & (4,6), (6,4) \\ \hline
11 & (5,6), (6,5) \\ \hline
12 & - \\ \hline
\end{array}
\] The answer is $2+2+4+4+6+4+4+2+2 = \boxed{30}.$
There is a much easier solution: there are $6 \times 5 = 30$ choices for the two marbles that I draw
Once I draw my two marbles, there is only $1$ way for Mathew to draw the marble which has the sum of my two marbles
So the total number of possibilities is just equal to the number of ways in which I can draw my two marbles, which is $\boxed{30}.$
There are a total of $5 \times 5 = 25$ possibilities
Multiplying $1$ or $2$ by any of the other numbers in the bowl will not result in a number greater than $10,$ so we know that Josh does not draw $1$ or $2.$ Therefore, Josh must draw a $4$ in order for the result to be even
Thus, his possibilities are: $(3,4);(4,3);(4,4);(4,5);(5,4)$, making for 5 possibilities, and a probability of $\frac{5}{25} = \boxed{\frac{1}{5}}.$
Ignoring the different colors of paper, we can put the stickers on the sheets of paper in the following groups: \begin{align*}
& (8,0,0,0) \\
& (7,1,0,0) \\
& (6,2,0,0) \\
& (6,1,1,0) \\
& (5,3,0,0) \\

& (3,3,1,1) \\
& (3,2,2,1) \\
& (2,2,2,2).
\end{align*}For each of these combinations, we will list how many distinct ways there are to put the groups of stickers on the different sheets of paper.
$\bullet$  For $(8,0,0,0),$ there are $\dfrac{4!}{3!}=4$ ways.
$\bullet$  For $(7,1,0,0),$ we have $\dfrac{4!}{2!}=12$ ways.
$\bullet$  For $(6,2,0,0),$ there are $\dfrac{4!}{2!}=12$ ways.
$\bullet$  For $(6,1,1,0),$ there are $\dfrac{4!}{2!}=12$ ways.

$\bullet$  For $(4,3,1,0),$ there are $4!=24$ ways.
$\bullet$  For $(4,2,2,0),$ there are $\dfrac{4!}{2!}=12$ ways.
$\bullet$  For $(4,2,1,1),$ we have $\dfrac{4!}{2!}=12$ ways.
$\bullet$  For $(3,3,2,0),$ there are $\dfrac{4!}{2!}=12$ ways.
$\bullet$  For $(3,3,1,1),$ there are $\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}=6$ ways.
$\bullet$  For $(3,2,2,1),$ we have $\dfrac{4!}{2!}=12$ ways.
$\bullet$  For $(2,2,2,2),$ there are $\dfrac{4!}{4!}=1$ way.
In total, there are $$4+12+12+12+12+24+4+6+24+12+12+12+6+12+1=\boxed{165}$$ways for Henry's brother to put the stickers on the sheets of paper.
Notice that this answer equals $\binom{11}{3}.$ Is this a coincidence?
There are two cases, one where the $AB$ is the base, and the other where $AB$ is a leg.
For the case where $AB$ is the base, we can create the third point $C$ anywhere on the line perpendicular to $AB$ at the midpoint of $AB$
There are $4$ points on that line.
For the case where $AB$ is a leg, since $AB$ is two units, we can create a point $C$ two units away from either $A$ or $B$
There are two such points.
In total, there are $2+4=\boxed{6}$

There are $\binom{10}{1}=10$ ways for Alex to choose which kind of lunch meat to put on his sandwich, and there are $\binom{9}{2}=36$ ways for Alex to choose which kinds of cheese to put on his sandwich
The total number of different sandwiches Alex can make is $10\cdot 36=\boxed{360}$.
The product will be a multiple of 3 if and only if at least one of the two rolls is a 3 or a 6
The probability that Juan rolls  3 or 6 is $2/8 = 1/4$
The probability that Juan does not roll 3 or 6, but Amal does is $(3/4) (1/3) = 1/4$
Thus, the probability that the product of the rolls is a multiple of 3 is $$
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.
Let $a$ be the number of colonies on Earth-like planets and $b$ be the number on Mars-like planets
We therefore seek nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$ such that $2a + b = 12$
From this equation, we see that $b$ can be at most 6 while $a$ can at most be 5
In addition, $b$ must be even, so the only possibilities are $b = 6, 4, 2$
Thus, there are 3 possible colonization options: $a = 3, b = 6; a=4, b = 4; a=5, b=2$.
In the first option, we take all 6 Mars-like planets, and can choose the Earth-like  planets in $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways
This gives us 10 possibilities
In the second option, we can choose any 4 of the 5 like Earth and any 4 of the 6 like Mars
This is $\binom{5}{4}\binom{6}{4} = 75$ possibilities
In the third option, all Earth-like planets must be occupied while only 2 of those like Mars must be occupied
This is $\binom{5}{5}\binom{6}{2} = 15$ possibilities
In all, there are $10 + 75 + 15 = \boxed{100}$ planets.
There are 16 multiples of 3 between 1 and 50 ($1\cdot 3$ through $16\cdot 3$), and $50-16=34$ numbers which are not multiples of 3
The probability that neither of the numbers Ben chooses is a multiple of 3 is $\left( \frac{34}{50} \right)^2=\frac{1156}{2500}$
Therefore, the probability that at least one of the numbers that Ben chooses is a multiple of 3 is $1-\frac{1156}{2500}=\frac{1344}{2500}=\boxed{\frac{336}{625}}$.
The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the fourth letter cannot be P
One way to solve this is to consider the permutations of all 7 letters where the first four satisfy these conditions, and then divide to correct for overcounting
Once we have placed the L, we have 5 options for where to place the P--- any spot except the fourth one, which will become the last one when we remove the last three letters
We can then place the remaining 5 letters without restriction, which there are $5!$ ways to do
This gives us a preliminary count of $5\times5!=600$
However, no matter what the order of the last three letters, we will still get the same sequence of the first 4 letters; for example, LPROMEB, LPROEBM, and LPROBEM and three other permutations all have the first 4 letters LPRO
Because of this, each sequence of 4 letters has been counted exactly 6 times so our answer is $\dfrac{5\times5!}{6}=\boxed{100}$.
Alternative solution by stevenmeow: There are 5 ways to choose the last letter (B, R, O, M, or E) and the L must go first
That leaves 5 letters from which to choose the second and third letters, so we can choose the second and third letters in $5\times 4 = 20$ ways
This gives us a total of $5\times 20 = 100$ sequences of letters.
Because all quadruples are equally likely, we need only examine the six clockwise orderings of the points: \[ACBD, ADBC, ABCD, ADCB, ABDC, \text{ and } ACDB.\] Only the first two of these equally likely orderings satisfy the intersection condition, so the probability is $2/6=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
Consider two cases:
$\bullet$  Case 1: the person wears a red shirt and a green hat
There are $5$ options for shirts, $6$ options for pants, and $8$ options for hats, for a total of $5 \times 6 \times 8 = 240$ outfits.
$\bullet$  Case 2: the person wears a green shirt and a red hat
There are $5$ options for shirts, $6$ options for pants, and $8$ options for hats, for a total of $5 \times 6 \times 8 = 240$ outfits.
Summing up the two cases, we have a total possibility of $240+240 = \boxed{480}$ outfits.
Notice that we can tackle this without considering cases
The person has $10$ choices for shirts
After a shirt is chosen, the person has $6$ choices for pants, but only $8$ choices of hat, since the hat color cannot match the shirt color, and no matter what shirt color is chosen, there are $8$ hats of the other color to choose from
So, there are $10\times 6\times 8 =\boxed{480}$ outfits.
For the contest to go to 7 games, the teams must be tied 3-3 after 6 games
There are $\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to pick which 3 of the 6 games the Lakers will win
Then there is a $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3$ chance that they will win the 3 games we pick and lose the other 3
So there is a $20\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3=\frac{160}{729}$ chance that the contest becomes tied 3-3
Then, there is a $\frac{1}{3}$ chance that the Lakers win the last game
So the final probability is $\frac{160}{729}\cdot \frac{1}{3} = \boxed{\frac{160}{2187}}$.
There are $\binom{11}{5} = 462$ ways to choose 5 balls out of the box
There is only $\binom{5}{5} = 1$ way to choose 5 white balls out of 5
This means that the probability that all 5 balls are white is $\boxed{\dfrac{1}{462}}$.
For an odd number, there are 5 choices for the units digit, coming from the set $\{1,3,5,7,9\}$
There will be 10 choices for the tens digit, 10 choices for the hundreds digit, and 9 choices for the thousands digit, which can not be zero
This is a total of: $$9\times10\times10\times5=4500\text{ four digit odd numbers}$$Multiples of 5 must end in 0 or 5
So, there are two possibilities for the units digit, and the same number of possibilities for remaining digits
This gives: $$9\times10\times10\times2=1800\text{ four digit multiples of 5}$$Therefore, $A+B=4500+1800=\boxed{6300}$.
Our goal is to divide the factors of 8! into three groups in such a way that the products of the factors in each group are as close together as possible
Write $8!$ as $8\cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2$
Observe that $30^3<8!<40^3$, so the cube root of $8!$ is between $30$ and $40$
With this in mind, we group $7$ and $5$ to make one factor of $35$
We can also make a factor of $36$ by using $6$ along with $3$ and $2$
This leaves $8$ and $4$ which multiply to give $32$
The assignment $(a,b,c)=(32,35,36)$ has the minimum value of $c-a$, since $31$, $33$, $34$, $37$, $38$, and $39$ contain prime factors not present in $8!$
Therefore, the minimum value of $c-a$ is $\boxed{4}$.
We have $x!-(x-3)! = 23$
Since $4!=24$, the number $23$ strongly suggests us to try $x=4$, and indeed, $4!-(4-3)! = 4!-1! = 24-1=23$, so $x=\boxed{4}$ is the answer.
Clearly one color isn't enough; $\boxed{2}$ colors will work because the tessellation shown is topologically identical to a chessboard (that is, imagine straightening out the diagonal lines to form an array of squares
This process doesn't change which tiles share a side.).
The most obvious way to solve this problem would be to list Pascal's Triangle to Row 8.
\begin{tabular}{rccccccccccccccccc}
Row 0:& & & & & & & & & 1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
Row 1:& & & & & & & & 1 & & 1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
Row 2:& & & & & & & 1 & & 2 & & 1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
Row 3:& & & & & & 1 & & 3 & & 3 & & 1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
Row 4:& & & & & 1 & & 4 & & 6 & & 4 & & 1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
Row 5:& & & & 1 & & 5 & & 10 & & 10 & & 5 & & 1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
Row 6:& & & 1 & & 6 & & 15 & & 20 & & 15 & & 6 & & 1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
Row 7:& & 1 & & 7 & & 21 & & 35 & & 35 & & 21 & & 7 & & 1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
Row 8:& 1 & & 8 & & 28 & & 56 & & 70 & & 56 & & 28 & & 8 & & 1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
\end{tabular}
We then add $1+8+28+56+70+56+28+8+1=\boxed{256}.$
An interesting note: We can sum the numbers in some of the smaller rows of Pascal's Triangle
Row 0 sums to $1,$ Row 1 sums to $1+1=2,$ Row 2 sums to $1+2+1=4,$ Row 3 sums to $1+3+3+1=8,$ and Row 4 sums to $1+4+6+4+1=16.$ We start to notice a pattern: the sum of the numbers in Row $n$ of Pascal's Triangle equals $2^{n}.$ Sure enough, the sum of the numbers in Row 8 is $256,$ which is $2^{8}.$
We have 6 digits to choose from: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9
We therefore have 6 choices for each of the digits in a 4-digit number, where we think of numbers with fewer than four digits as having leading 0s
(For example, 0097 is 97.)  Since we have 6 choices for each of the four digits in the number, there are $6^4 = 1296$ ways to form the number
However, we must exclude 0000 since this is not between 1 and 9999, inclusive,  so there are $1296-1 = \boxed{1295}$ numbers.
We clearly can't have both two kings and at least 1 ace, so we have two exclusive cases to evaluate separately.
Case 1: Two kings
The probability that two kings are drawn is $\frac{4}{52} \cdot \frac{3}{51} = \frac{1}{221}$.
Case 2: At least 1 ace
We can break this into two cases:
Subcase 2A: Exactly 1 ace
We can choose the ace first with probability $\frac{4}{52}\cdot \frac{48}{51}$, and we can choose the ace last with probablity $\frac{48}{52} \cdot \frac{4}{51}$
So, the total probability of getting exactly one ace is $2\cdot\frac{48}{52}\cdot\frac{4}{51} = \frac{32}{221}$.
Subcase 2B: 2 aces
The probability of this occurring is the same as that of two kings, $\frac{1}{221}$.
So, the total probability for Case 2 is $\frac{33}{221}$.
Adding this to our probability for Case 1, we have $\frac{34}{221} =\boxed{ \frac{2}{13}}$.
The only prime numbers that divide $30!$ are less than or equal to 30
So 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 are primes that divide $30!$, and there are $\boxed{10}$ of these.
If all three digits are different, there are 4 choices for the first digit, 3 for the second, and 2 for the third, giving $(4)(3)(2) = 24$ integers
If two of them are the same, the repeated digit digit is either 5 or 6
There are 2 choices for the repeated digit, then 3 choices for the non-repeating digit, and 3 ways to arrange these digits (for example, if the repeating digit is 5 and the non-repeating digit is 6, we can have 655, 565, and 556)
This gives $(2)(3)(3) = 18$ integers
Finally, if all three digits are the same, the number must be 555
So there are $24+18+1 = \boxed{43}$ possible integers.
There are only two ways for a family of three to not have at least one boy and at least one girl: either the family is all boys, or it is all girls
The probability that a family is all boys is $\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) ^3=\frac{1}{8}$, and the probability that a family is all girls is also $\frac{1}{8}$
Therefore, the probability that a family of three is neither all girls nor all boys is $1-\frac{1}{8}-\frac{1}{8}=\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.
There are a total of $\binom{8}{4} = 70$ combinations of socks
We seek combinations that have one pair of socks with the same color and two separate socks with different colors for a total of three colors
There are $\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose three colors
From each combination of three colors, there are $\binom{3}{1}$ ways to choose a color for the only pair of socks
There are 2 socks to choose from for each of the colors that only appear once among the four socks she chooses
Therefore, there are $\binom{4}{3}\binom{3}{1}\cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 48$ ways to choose an appropriate combination of socks
The probability of choosing such a combination is $\frac{48}{70} = \boxed{\frac{24}{35}}$.
We can add together the number of lineups with one triplet and with no triplets
The number of lineups with no triplets is $\binom{11}{6} = 462$, since we must choose 6 starters from the 11 remaining players
When one triplet is in the lineup, there are $3\cdot \binom{11}{5} = 1386$ options
So the total number of lineups with at most one triplet is $1386 + 462 = \boxed{1848}$.
Every factor of $n$ is in the form $2^a\cdot3^b\cdot7^c$ for $0\le a\le2$, $0\le b\le1$, and $0\le c\le2$
To count the number of even factors, we must restrict the power of 2 to be at least 1: $1\le a\le2$
This gives us a total of $(2)(1+1)(2+1)=\boxed{12}$ even factors.
By Pascal's Rule, \begin{align*}
\binom{17}{9} &= \binom{16}{9} + \binom{16}{8} \\
\binom{17}{9} &= \binom{15}{8} + \binom{15}{9} + \binom{15}{7} + \binom{15}{8} \\
\binom{17}{9} &= \binom{15}{8} + \binom{15}{15-9} + \binom{15}{15-7} + \binom{15}{8} \\
\binom{17}{9} &= \binom{15}{8} + \binom{15}{6} + \binom{15}{8} + \binom{15}{8} \\
\binom{17}{9} &= 6435 + 5005 + 6435 + 6435 \\
\binom{17}{9} &= \boxed{24310}
\end{align*}
While it is almost tempting to make this into the casework problem to end all casework problems, using complementary probability makes the problem a lot simpler, so we will find the probability that the product is not composite.
It's clear that if more than one die shows a roll greater than 1, the resulting product will have more than one factor that is greater than 1 and therefore be composite
Additionally, if any of the dice show a 4 or a 6, the product will obviously be composite
So in order for the product to not be composite, we need at least four dice to be a 1 and the fifth die to either be another 1 or a 2, a 3, or a 5.
There's exactly one way in which all the the dice can be 1's, and for each of the other three cases there are 5 ways since the die that isn't a 1 can appear in any of the 5 other positions, so there are a total of $3\cdot5+1=16$ ways of rolling the dice that result in a product that isn't composite
Additionally, there are 6 options for the roll of each of the 5 dice for a total of $6^5=7776$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of the product not being composite is $\dfrac{16}{7776}$ and the probability that it is composite is $1-\frac{16}{7776}=\frac{7760}{7776}=\boxed{\frac{485}{486}}$.
Note: Many students have tried to argue that 1 is not a prime number and should not be counted
As we are doing complementary probability, it is important to consider all numbers that are not composite, and 1 is definitely not composite.
There are $\binom{9}{2} = 36$ pairs of points in the nonagon, and all but 9 (the sides of the nonagon) are diagonals, which means there are 27 diagonals
So there are $\binom{27}{2} = 351$ pairs of diagonals
Any four points on the nonagon uniquely determine a pair of intersecting diagonals
(If vertices $A,B,C,D$ are chosen, where $ABCD$ is a convex quadrilateral, the intersecting pair of diagonals are $AC$ and $BD$.)  So the number of sets of intersecting diagonals is the number of combinations of 4 points, which is $\binom{9}{4} = 126$
So the probability that a randomly chosen pair of diagonals intersect is $\dfrac{126}{351} = \boxed{\dfrac{14}{39}}$.
$\dbinom{5}{1} = \dfrac{5!}{1!4!}=\dfrac{(5\times 4\times 3\times 2)(1)}{(1)(4\times 3\times 2\times 1)}=\dfrac{5}{1}=\boxed{5}.$
We start with the $0$th row, which has $1$ number
Each row has one more number than the previous row
Thus, we can see that row $n$ has $n+1$ numbers.
Since we want the sum of numbers in the rows $0$ to $19$, we sum up every number from $1$ to $20$ to get $\frac{(1+20)\cdot 20}{2}=\boxed{210}$.
We let the $x$-axis represent the number of the green point and the $y$-axis represent the number of the purple point, and we shade in the region where the number of the purple point is between the number of the green point and twice the number of the green point.

The shaded region can be divided into two triangles, each with base $\frac{1}{2}$ and height $\frac{1}{2}$
The total area of the shaded region is then $\frac{1}{4}$
Since the area of the whole square is 1, the probability that a randomly chosen point lies in the shaded region is $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
The next border requires an additional $6\times 3=18$ green tiles
A total of 24 green and 13 blue tiles will be used, so the difference is $24-13=\boxed{11}$

If both Penelope and Quentin are not officers, then there are 20 choices for chairman, 19 choices for vice-chairman, and 18 choices for sergeant-at-arms
There are $20\times 19\times 18=6840$ ways in this case.
If both are officers, Penelope can take one of the 3 positions, Quentin can take one of the 2 remaining positions, and one of the 20 remaining members can take the third position
There are $3\times 2\times 20=120$ ways in this case.
The answer is $6840+120=\boxed{6960}.$
Since the boxes are indistinguishable, there are 5 different cases for arrangements of the number of balls in each box: $(5,0,0)$, $(4,1,0)$, $(3,2,0)$, $(3,1,1)$, or $(2,2,1)$.
$(5,0,0)$: There is only $1$ way to put all 5 balls in one box.
$(4,1,0)$: There are $\binom{5}{4} = 5$ choices for the 4 balls in one of the boxes.
$(3,2,0)$: There are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ choices for the 3 balls in one of the boxes.
$(3,1,1)$: There are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ choices for the 3 balls in one of the boxes, and we simply split the last two among the other indistinguishable boxes.
$(2,2,1)$:  There are $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ options for one of the boxes with two balls, then $\binom{3}{2} = 3$ options for the second box with two balls, and one option remaining for the third
However since the boxes with two balls are indistinguishable, we are counting each pair of balls twice, and must divide by two
So there are $\dfrac{10 \times 3}{2} = 15$ arrangements of balls as $(2,2,1)$.
Thus the total number of arrangements for 3 indistinguishable boxes and 5 distinguishable balls is $1 + 5 + 10 + 10 + 15 = \boxed{41}$.
$\textbf{Alternate solution:}$ There are $3^5 = 243$ arrangements to put 5 distinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes
Among these 243 arrangements, there is one case in our problem that is counted three times: if all 5 balls are placed in one box and the other two boxes both contain nothing
This leaves 240 other arrangements.
For every other case, the contents of each box is different, and so these cases are each counted $3! = 6$ times
Therefore there must be 40 of these cases, and we have $\boxed{41}$ cases total.
Because of the symmetric nature of the number 11, it is a divisor of many palindromes
Expanding powers of $x+y$ (where $x = 10$ and $y = 1$) helps us see why the first few powers of 11 are all palindromes:  \begin{align*}
(x + y)^2 &= x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\
11^2 &= 121 \\
(x + y)^3 &= x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3 \\
11^3 &= 1331 \\
(x + y)^4 &= x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4\\
11^4 &= 14641 \\
(x + y)^5 &= x^5 + 5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 + y^5 \\
11^5 &= 161051 \end{align*} Notice that each term of the form $x^i y^{n-i}$ ends up being a power of $10$, and the digits of $(x+y)^n$ end up being the binomial coefficients when these coefficients are less than $10$, as there is no carrying
Because of the identity $\binom{n}{i}=\binom{n}{n-i}$, the number is a palindrome whenever the coefficients are all less than $10$, which is true for powers less than 5
However, from the list above, we see that $(x+y)^5$ has coefficients at least 10, and indeed, we have $11^5 = \boxed{161051}$, which is not a palindrome.
If each person shakes hands with exactly two other people, then there will be $\frac{23 \cdot 2}{2} = \boxed{23}$ handshakes
To achieve 23 handshakes, we arrange the participants in a circle
Each person shakes hands with the two people next to him or her.
The results on the three dice are independent of each other, so we compute the probability for each die and then multiply the probabilities
The first die does not have to be a particular number
There are 6 possible numbers, but any number will work, so the probability is $\frac{6}{6}=1$
The second die must be the same number as the first die, which is one number out of the 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\frac{1}{6}$
The third die must also be the same number as the first die, so the probability is also $\frac{1}{6}$
The probability that all three dice will have the same number is then $1\times\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{1}{6}=\boxed{\frac{1}{36}}$.

In all, the probability of the meeting occurring is the volume of the big square pyramid minus the volumes of the smaller triangular pyramids divided by the volume of the cube: $\frac{8/3-1/6-1/6}8=\frac{7/3}8=\boxed{\frac{7}{24}}$.
It's tempting to do this problem using casework, but there's an easier way
There are a total of $\binom{14}{6}=3003$ ways to select a lineup with no restrictions
Of those 3003 lineups, the only ones that don't satisfy the given condition are ones that contain all three triplets
There are $\binom{11}{3}=165$ of these, since once we insert the three triplets in the lineup we have 3 spots left to fill using the remaining 11 players
Subtracting gives us our answer: $3003-165=\boxed{2838}$ possible starting line ups.
The $n^{th}$ ring can be partitioned into four rectangles: two containing $2n+1$ unit squares and two containing $2n-1$ unit squares
So there are $$2(2n+1)+2(2n-1) = 8n$$ unit squares in the $n^{th}$ ring
Thus, the $100^{th}$ ring has $8 \cdot 100 = \boxed{800}$ unit squares.
There are 5 odd digits, and thus, each digit has 5 different possibilities, making for $5^3 = \boxed{125}$ possibilities.
We will use complementary probability: we will find the probability that no more than 1 baby speaks tomorrow, and then subtract the result from 1
There are two cases to consider: None of the babies will speak and that exactly 1 will speak.
1) The probability that none of the babies will speak tomorrow is $\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{5} = 243/1024$.
2) The probability that exactly 1 will speak is $\binom{5}{1}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{4}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) = \frac{405}{1024}$.
The sum of these probabilities is $\frac{243 + 405}{1024} = \frac{648}{1024} = \frac{81}{128}$
Since the probability that no more than 1 baby will speak is $\frac{81}{128}$, the probability that more than 1 baby will speak is $1 - \frac{81}{128} = \boxed{\frac{47}{128}}$.
There are $\binom92$ choices of two points for a line to pass through
However, this counts each line that goes through three points three times, so we must subtract twice the number of lines which go through three points
Our answer is thus $\binom92-2\cdot8=36-16=\boxed{20}$ lines.
There are 3 odd digits which can begin the rock's age
For the five remaining spaces, the numbers can be arranged in $5!$ ways.
However, because the digit `2' repeats three times, we must divide by $3!$, or the number of ways to arrange those three 2s.
The answer is $\dfrac{3\times5!}{3!} = \boxed{60}$.
$\underline{\text{Method 1}}$
Make a diagram and draw $4$ lines so that they intersect each other as shown
The number of different sections is $\boxed{11}.$
draw((0,0)--(6,0)--(6,4)--(0,4)--(0,0));
draw((2,0)--(4,4));

label("M",(2,0),S);
draw((4,0)--(2,4));
draw((5.5,4)--(0,1.5));
draw((0,3)--(5,0));
[/asy]
$\underline{\text{Method 2}}$
Make a table
The original rectangle without lines added is considered to be one section.
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Total number of lines added} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
\hline
\text{Total number of sections} & 1 & 2 & 4 & 7 & ?\\
\hline
\end{array}
$$ Look for a pattern
Observe that the $1^\text{st}$ added line results in increasing the preceding total of sections by $1,$ the $2^\text{nd}$ added line increases the preceding total of sections by $2,$ the $3^\text{rd}$ added line increases the preceding total sections by $3.$ It seems that the $4^\text{th}$ added line will increase the preceding total of sections by $4$ and that there will be $7+4$ or $11$ sections
Examine the $4^\text{th}$ line in the diagram below
When the $4^\text{th}$ line intersects the first of the $3$ interior lines, it creates a new section
This happens each time the $4^\text{th}$ line crosses an interior line
When the $4^\text{th}$ line finally ends at a point on the rectangle, it creates a $4^\text{th}$ new section
Thus the $4^\text{th}$ line creates a total of $4$ new sections
The answer to the given problem is $\boxed{11}.$
(If a 5th line were added, it would increase the preceding total of sections by 5.)

The probability that a 10-sided die rolls a prime number is $\frac{4}{10}=\frac{2}{5}$ since the primes it can roll are 2, 3, 5, and 7
We can choose which dice show a prime number in $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways
Then, there is a $\frac{2}{5}\cdot \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{5}=\frac{36}{625}$ chance that the chosen dice will actually roll a prime number and the other dice won't
Therefore, the total probability that exactly two dice show a prime number is $6 \cdot \frac{36}{625}=\boxed{\frac{216}{625}}$.
Let the number of blue-eyed students be $x$, so the number of blond students is $2x$
Since the number of blue-eyed blond students is $6$, the number of blue-eyed non-blond students is $x - 6$, while the number of blond non-blue-eyed students is $2x - 6$
Since the number of non-blue-eyed non-blond students is $3$, we can add up these four exclusive categories (blond blue-eyed, blond non-blue-eyed, etc.) to sum to 30 students in the class.
unitsize(0.05cm);
label("Blue eyes", (2,74));
label("Blond hair", (80,74));
label("Neither: 3", (44,10));
draw(Circle((30,45), 22));
draw(Circle((58, 45), 22));
label("$6$", (44, 45));
label(scale(0.8)*"$x-6$",(28,58));
label(scale(0.8)*"$2x-6$",(63,58));
[/asy]
So $(x - 6) + (2x - 6) + 6 + 3 = 30$ and $x = \boxed{11}$, which is the number of blue-eyed students.
First we choose the goalie, and any of the 15 people can be the goalie
Then we choose 6 more players from the remaining 14 players, which is same as choosing a committee
There are 14 ways to choose the first player, 13 ways to choose the second player, and so on, down to 9 ways to choose the sixth player
We must then divide by $6!$ since order of the six players doesn't matter
So the answer is $\dfrac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9}{6!} =\boxed{45,\!045}$.
$ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) is divisible by 3 only when $a+b$ is divisible by 3
Since 3 divides both $a$ and $a+b$, 3 must divide $b$
Therefore, $a$ and $b$ can equal 3 or 6
The probability that $a$ equals 3 or 6 is $\frac26 = \frac13$
The probability that $b$ equals 3 or 6 is $\frac26 = \frac13$
Therefore, The probability that both $a$ and $b$ equal 3 or 6 is $\left(\frac13\right)^2 = \boxed{\frac19}$.
Let the integer have digits $a$, $b$, and $c$, read left to right
Because $1 \leq a<b<c$, none of the digits can be zero and $c$ cannot be 2
If $c=4$, then $a$ and $b$ must each be chosen from the digits 1, 2, and 3
Therefore there are $\binom{3}{2}=3$ choices for $a$ and $b$, and for each choice there is one acceptable order
Similarly, for $c=6$ and $c=8$ there are, respectively, $\binom{5}{2}=10$ and $\binom{7}{2}=21$ choices for $a$ and $b$
Thus there are altogether $3+10+21=\boxed{34}$ such integers.
An $n$-gon has $n(n-3)/2$ diagonals
To see this, subtract the $n$ consecutive pairs of vertices from the $\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of vertices:  \begin{align*}
\binom{n}{2}-n&=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-n \\
&=\frac{n^2-n}{2}-\frac{2n}{2} \\
&=\frac{n^2-n-2n}{2} \\
&=\frac{n^2-3n}{2} \\
&=\frac{n(n-3)}{2}.
\end{align*} An octagon has $8(8-3)/2=\boxed{20}$ diagonals.
To get the constant term, the $\sqrt{x}$'s and $5/x$'s must cancel out
This occurs for the term with six $\sqrt{x}$'s and three $5/x$'s, so the coefficient is $$\binom93\cdot5^3=84\cdot125=\boxed{10500}.$$
The probability that the first non-negative single-digit number in Bob's password is also odd is $\frac{5}{10}=\frac{1}{2}$ because exactly $5$ out of the $10$ non-negative single-digit numbers are odd
The probability that the following character in Bob's password is a letter is $1$ since it must be a letter according to the prescribed format
Finally, the probability that the last character is a positive single-digit number is $\frac{9}{10}$ because $0$ is the only non-negative single-digit number that is not positive
Hence the desired probability is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 1\cdot\frac{9}{10}=\boxed{\frac{9}{20}}$ since the choices for the three characters are independent.
We can see that the maximum positive difference is $16 - 1 = 15.$ Some quick calculations show that we can get all values between $1$ and $15.$ \begin{align*}
16 - 1 &= 15 \\
16 - 2 &= 14 \\
16 - 3 &= 13 \\
& \ \,\vdots \\
16-14&=2\\
16-15&=1
\end{align*} Therefore there are $\boxed{15}$ different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 14, 15, 16 \}.$
Since only the number of stickers on the sheets matters, we can list the possibilities systematically:  \begin{align*}
& 8-0-0-0 \\
& 7-1-0-0 \\
& 6-2-0-0 \\
& 6-1-1-0 \\
& 5-3-0-0 \\
& 5-2-1-0 \\
& 5-1-1-1 \\
& 4-4-0-0 \\
& 4-3-1-0 \\
& 4-2-2-0 \\
& 4-2-1-1 \\
& 3-3-2-0 \\
& 3-3-1-1 \\
& 3-2-2-1 \\
& 2-2-2-2
\end{align*} There are $\boxed{15}$ possible arrangements of stickers on sheets of paper.
The number formed is odd if and only if its units digit is not 2
Since the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7 are arranged randomly, the probability that 2 is the units digit is 1/4
Therefore, the probability that the number is odd is $1-1/4=\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.
We draw a Venn Diagram with three circles, and fill it in starting with the center and proceeding outwards
There are $9$ dogs that can do all three tricks
Since $18$ dogs can sit and roll over (and possibly stay) and $9$ dogs can sit, roll over, and stay, there are $18 - 9 = 9$ dogs that can sit, roll over, but not stay
Using the same reasoning, there are $12 - 9 = 3$ dogs that can stay, rollover, but not sit, and $17 - 9 = 8$ dogs that can sit, stay, but not rollover.
[asy]unitsize(50);
import graph;
pair A = (0,-1); pair B = (sqrt(3)/2,1/2); pair C = (-sqrt(3)/2,1/2);

label("13",A); label("9",B); label("24",C); label("$9$",(0,0)); label("$8$",(B+C)/2); label("$3$",(A+B)/2); label("$9$",(A+C)/2);
label("Sit",2.4C,C); label("Stay",2.4B,B); label("Roll Over", 2.4A,A);[/asy]
So now we know how many dogs can do multiple tricks, and exactly what tricks they can do
Since $50$ dogs can sit, $9$ dogs can sit and rollover only, $8$ dogs can sit and stay only, and $9$ dogs can do all three tricks, the remaining dogs that can't do multiple tricks can only sit, and there are $50 - 9 - 8 - 9 = 24$ of these
Using the same reasoning, we find that $29 - 3 - 8 - 9 = 9$ dogs can only stay and $34 - 9 - 3 - 9 = 13$ dogs can only roll over.
Since $9$ dogs can do no tricks, we can add that to each category in the Venn Diagram to find that there are a total of $9 + 9 + 3 + 8 + 24 + 13 + 9 + 9 = \boxed{84}$ dogs.
Since we need to make a palindrome, it only matters what we pick for the first 4 digits, since the other three are reflections of the first three
Therefore, since each of them has 3 possibilities, our total is $3^4 = \boxed{81}$.
The probability that it does not rain over the weekend is equal to the product of the probability it does not rain Saturday and the probability it does not rain Sunday, or $(1-.40)(1-.50)=.6\cdot.5=.3=30\%$
Therefore, the probability that it does rain is $100\%-30\%=\boxed{70\%}$.
Pick one of the teams as the host
There are $\dbinom{7}{3}=35$ ways to select the three representatives from that team and $\dbinom{7}{2}=21$ ways to pick a representative from each of the other teams
So once we have selected a host team, there are $35\times21\times21\times21=324,\!135$ ways to pick the members of the tournament committee
However, any of the four teams can be the host, so we need to multiply $324,\!135$ by 4 to get $\boxed{1,\!296,\!540}$ ways.
She can do this if and only if at least one of the dice lands on a 1
The probability neither of the dice is a 1 is $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right) \left(\frac{5}{6}\right) = \frac{25}{36}$
So the probability at least one die is a 1 is $1-\frac{25}{36} = \boxed{\frac{11}{36}}$.
Tamika can get the numbers $8+9=17$, $8+10=18$, or $9+10=19$
Carlos can get $3\times5=15$, $3\times6=18$, or $5\times6=30$
The possible ways to pair these are: $(17,15)$, $(17,18)$, $(17,30)$, $(18,15)$, $(18,18)$, $(18,30)$, $(19,15)$, $(19,18)$, $(19,30)$
Four of these nine pairs show Tamika with a higher result, so the probability is $\boxed{\frac{4}{9}}$.
We can list the first 10 rows of Pascal's triangle, and mark the even numbers.

if (n % 2 == 0) {label("$\boxed{" + string(n) + "}$", i*(-1,-1) + j*(1,-1));}
if (n % 2 == 1) {label("$" + string(n) + "$", i*(-1,-1) + j*(1,-1));}

Thus, the number of even numbers is $1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 7 + 6 = \boxed{22}.$
Let's suppose George decides to seat the husbands first
Once he chooses a seat for a husband, the opposite seat must go to his wife
So George has 8 choices for his seat, 6 choices for the next husband's seat, then 4, then 2
But we haven't accounted for the rotations and reflections
Each seating arrangement can be rotated to seven others, or reflected and then rotated to 8 more, for a total of 16 identical arrangements that we have counted as the same
This makes the actual number of seating arrangements $\frac{8\cdot6\cdot4\cdot2}{16}=\boxed{24}$.
\begin{align*}
P(\text{first two cards are red}) &= \frac{\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\text{Number of possible outcomes}}\\

\end{align*}
When there was only one street in Math City, there were no intersections
When the second street was built, there was one intersection
When the third street was built, it made at most 2 new intersections for a total of $1+2=3$ intersections in Math City
Similarly, when the $n$th street is built, it intersects at most all of the existing $n-1$ streets at a new intersection
Therefore, the greatest number of intersections after 8 roads are built is $1+2+3+\cdots+7=\frac{7(8)}{2}=\boxed{28}$
Alternatively, we can note that there are $\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways to choose two roads to intersect, so there are at most 28 intersections.
Note: Since there are no pairs of parallel roads, there will be 28 points of intersection unless three or more of the roads meet at a single intersection
This can be avoided by adjusting the path of one of the roads slightly.
There are 10 balls whose number is divisible by 5
The balls $7, 14, \ldots,49$ are multiples of 7
There are 7 of these
The ball 35 is the unique ball that is a multiple of both 5 and 7.
In total, there are $10+7-1 = 16$ balls whose number is divisible by 5 or 7
The probability that a randomly selected ball will be one of these 16 is $\frac{16}{50} = \boxed{\frac{8}{25}}$.
We are choosing 6 starters from 14 players, which can be done in $\binom{14}{6} = \boxed{3003}$ ways.
Since 150 divided by 4 is 37.5, there are 37 blocks of 4 years in 150 years, plus two extra years
If we let one of those two extra years be a leap year, and we have one leap year in each of the 37 blocks, then we have 38 leap years
For example, we can choose a 150-year period that starts with a leap year
For example, 1904-2053 is a 150-year period with 38 leap years $(1904, 1908, \ldots, 2052)$
Now we check that under no circumstance will 39 work
We see the optimal situation would be if we start with a leap year and end with a leap year
Leap years happen every four years, so if we start with year $x$, $x$ being a leap year, the $38^{\text{th}}$ leap year after $x$ is $x+4\times38 = x+152$, so including $x$ there must be a total of 153 years, which is greater than 150
Therefore no 150-year period will contain 39 leap years
Hence, the answer is $\boxed{38}$.
The prime digits are 2, 3, 5, and 7
Since each of the two digits in the integer can be any of the four prime digits, there are $4\cdot4=\boxed{16}$ total such integers.
If both dice were numbered $1$ through $20,$ we could get a sum of $24$ in the following ways: \begin{align*}
4&+20\\
5&+19\\
6&+18\\
& \ \, \vdots \\
18&+6\\
19&+5\\
\end{align*} This is a total of $20-4+1=17$ ways
However, the first die does not have a face with $20,$ so we must remove the possibility of rolling $20+4.$  Also, the second die does not have a face with $9,$ so we must remove the possibility of rolling $15+9.$ This leaves $17-2=15$ possible ways to roll $24.$ There are a total of $20\cdot 20=400$ possible rolls, so the final probability is: $$\frac{15}{400}=\boxed{\frac{3}{80}}.$$
This problem refers to the property of coins and other trial-independent probability devices that we refer to as not having memory
In other words, the coin cannot respond in any way to how it landed on the previous 5 flips
It is still equally likely to be heads or tails on its next flip, so the probability is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

The shaded region represents the years both mathematicians would have been alive
For example, if Karl was born 200 years ago, Johann could have been born anywhere between 300 and 100 years ago
Let 500 years equal one unit
Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles
This will be equal to $2\cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{4}{5}=\frac{16}{25}$
So, the area of the shaded region is $1-\frac{16}{25}=\frac{9}{25}$
Since the area of the square is 1, this is also the probability that Karl and Johann were contemporaries
The answer, then, is $\boxed{\frac{9}{25}}$.
The hexagons in the second column to the left must be yellow and green, but either color can be on top: 2 possibilities
With either possibility, the rest of the figure is easily colored in, with the color of every other hexagon being forced
In the third column, the middle hexagon must be red, and the top and bottom must be the opposite of the top and bottom in the second column)  Thus, there are only $\boxed{2}$ possibilities.
The area of the rectangular region is 2
Hence the probability that $P$ is closer to $(0,0)$ than it is to $(3,1)$ is half the area of the trapezoid bounded by the lines $y=1$, the $x$- and $y$-axes, and the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining $(0,0)$ and $(3,1)$
The perpendicular bisector goes through the point $(3/2,1/2)$, which is the center of the square whose vertices are $(1,0), (2,0), (2,1), \text{ and
}(1,1)$
Hence, the line cuts the square  into two quadrilaterals of equal  area $1/2$
Thus the area of the trapezoid is $3/2$ and the probability is $\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.

A total of 255 players must be eliminated to determine the champion, and one player is eliminated after each game, so it is easy to see that $\boxed{255}$ games must be played.
Since the balls are indistinguishable, we need only count the number of balls in the distinguishable boxes
We can put 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0 balls in Box 1 (and the rest go in Box 2)
So there are $\boxed{6}$ different arrangements.
The hundreds digit can be any one of 1, 2, 3 or 4
Whatever the hundreds digit is, that fixes what the units digit can be
Then, there are 10 choices for the middle (tens) digit
So, we can construct $4 \cdot 10 = \boxed{40}$ palindromes by choosing the digits.
Let $r$ represent the number of red balls in the bag
The probability that the first ball is red is $\frac{r}{10}$, while the probability that the other ball is red becomes $\frac{r-1}{9}$ (drawing two balls at random at the same time is similar to drawing one ball and then drawing another ball without replacement)
So the probability that both balls are red is $\frac{r}{10}\cdot\frac{r-1}{9}$, which we set equal to $\frac{1}{15}$
\begin{align*}
\frac{r}{10}\cdot\frac{r-1}{9}&=\frac{1}{15}\quad\Rightarrow\\
r(r-1)&=\frac{90}{15}\quad\Rightarrow\\
r^2-r-6&=0\quad\Rightarrow\\
(r-3)(r+2)&=0
\end{align*} The value of $r$ cannot be negative, so $r=3$
There are $\boxed{3}$ red balls in the bag.
We could do this with a bit of casework, but that gets boring after a while
Instead, we can use complementary probability -- we'll find the probability that Mr
Wong has exactly the same number of grandsons as granddaughters, and then subtract this from 1
Since each grandchild can be male or female with equal likelihood, there are $2^{10}=1024$ possible ways in which the genders of the grandchildren can be determined
The only way in which Mr
Wong won't have more grandsons than granddaughters or more granddaughters than grandsons is if he has exactly 5 of each, which can occur in $\binom{10}{5}$ ways, since there are $\binom{10}{5}$ ways to choose 5 of the 10 children to be boys (the others then are girls)
Therefore, the probability that Mr
Wong has the same number of grandsons and granddaughters is  $$\dfrac{\binom{10}{5}}{2^{10}} = \frac{252}{1024} = \frac{63}{256}.$$
Since the probability that he has the same number of granddaughters and grandsons is $\frac{63}{256}$, the probability he doesn't have the same number of granddaughters and grandsons is $1-\frac{63}{256} = \boxed{\frac{193}{256}}$.
There are $\binom{16}{2} = 120$ ways to pick 2 of the 16 people to quit
There are $\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways for them to both be from the first tribe, and $\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways for them to both be from the other tribe, for a total of $28 + 28 = 56$ ways for them both to be from the same tribe
So the odds that both people who quit are from the same tribe is $56/120 = \boxed{\frac{7}{15}}$.
Since $n$ has the same remainder whether divided by 6 or by 8, we can write that $n = 6a + r = 8b + r$, where $0\leq r \leq 5$
This implies that $3a = 4b$, and so $a$ is a multiple of 4 and we can write $a = 4k$ for some integer $k$
Since $100<n<200$, we see that $95<6a<200$, or $\frac{95}{24} < k <\frac{200}{24}$
Since $k$ is an integer, $4\leq k \leq 8$
If $k = 4$, then we must have $r = 5$
Otherwise, $r = 0,1,2,3,4,5$ are all allowable
Thus we have a total of $\boxed{25}$ possible values for $n$.
Each number in Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it
If we use $0\text{'s}$ and $1\text{'s}$ to stand for "even" and "odd", then by using the rules $0+0=0,$ $0+1=1,$ and $1+1=0,$ we can efficiently compute the parity (even- or oddness) of the entries without computing the entries themselves: \begin{tabular}{c *{40}{@{}c}}

\end{tabular} Anyway, this table shows that there are four rows that qualify: the $2^{\rm nd},$ $4^{\rm th},$ $8^{\rm th},$ and $16^{\rm th}$ rows
So the answer is $\boxed{4}.$
There are two O's and five total letters, so the answer is $\dfrac{5!}{2!} = \boxed{60}$.
The possible values of $r$ are represented by the set $$R = \{ -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \}$$ and for $k$ the set $$K = \{ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \}.$$ There are thus $8 \cdot 6 = 48$ pairs of integers.
Now, we see which satisfy the divisibility requirement that $k|r$
If $r = -2$ then $k$ can only be 2, or 1 integer
If $r = -1$, then $k$ can be no integer
If $r = 0$, then $k$ can be any integer, or 6 choices
If $r = 1$, then $k$ cannot be any integer
If $r = 2$, then $k$ can only be 2, or 1 integer
If $r = 3$ then $k$ can only be 3, or 1 integer
If $r = 4$, then $k$ can be 2 or 4, or 2 different integers
If $r = 5$, then $k = 5$ is the only possibility, for 1 integer
So, $1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12$ possibilities
So, $\frac{12}{48} = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$ is the probability of $r \div k$ being an integer.
The first condition is equivalent to the statement that $a = 4$ or $a = 5$
The second condition is equivalent to the statement that $d = 0$ or $d = 5$
Finally, the third condition is equivalent to the statement that the ordered pair $(b, c)$ is one of the pairs \[(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6),(5,6).\]In total, $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 6=\boxed{24}$ four-digit numbers $N$ satisfying the conditions.
Precisely one team must win at least four games
Since the teams are equally matched, this team will be the Badgers with probability $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
There are 16 cards in a standard deck which are either diamonds or aces
The probability that neither card chosen is a diamond or an ace is $\left( \frac{36}{52} \right) ^2=\left( \frac{9}{13} \right) ^2=\frac{81}{169}$
Therefore, the probability that at least one of the cards chosen was a diamond or an ace is $1-\frac{81}{169}=\boxed{\frac{88}{169}}$.
With the center of dilation at the origin and a scale factor of 2, all the coordinates of square $ABCD$ are twice the coordinates of its preimage
The preimage has an area of 4 square units, so its side length is 2 units
Since the center of the preimage is at $(8, -8)$, the four vertices of the preimage are at $(7, -9), (7, -7), (9, -7)$ and $(9, -9)$
The point $(9, -9)$ is the farthest from the origin on the preimage, so the point farthest from the origin on the image of square $ABCD$ is $\boxed{(18, -18)}.$
For any angle $x$, we have $\sin (180^\circ - x)=\sin x$, so $\sin RPS = \sin(180^\circ - \angle RPS) = \sin \angle RPQ = \boxed{\frac{7}{25}}$.
The resulting solid is the union of two cylinders: one whose radius is 5 units and whose height is 1 unit (the squares shown in light gray produce this cylinder), and the other whose radius is 2 units and whose height is 3 units (shown in dark gray)
The sum of these volumes is $\pi(5)^2(1)+\pi(2)^2(3)=\boxed{37\pi}$ cubic units.

The first few prime numbers are: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,\ldots$
Since the triangle is scalene, all the sides are different primes.
If one side is 2, then the other two sides must be odd
Then the perimeter of the triangle would be even
But the perimeter must also be greater than 2, so it cannot be prime
This means that none of the sides can be 2.
Now, suppose one side is 3
Let the other two sides be $p$ and $q,$ where $p < q.$  Since all the sides are different,
\[3 < p < q.\]Also, by the Triangle Inequality, $p + 3 > q,$ so
\[p > q - 3.\]Since $p < q,$ the only possible values of $p$ are $q - 2$ and $q - 1.$
Since $p$ is a prime greater than 3, $p$ is odd
If $p = q - 1,$ then $q = p + 1$ is even, which means $q$ is not prime
Therefore, $p = q - 2,$ or
\[q = p + 2.\]As a number, $p$ must be of the form $3k,$ $3k + 1,$ or $3k + 2.$  Since $p$ is prime, $p$ cannot be of the form $3k.$  If $p = 3k + 1,$ then $q = p + 2 = 3k + 3 = 3(k + 1),$ which is not prime
Therefore, $p = 3k + 2.$  Then $q = p + 2 = 3k + 4,$ and the perimeter of the triangle is
\[p + q + 3 = (3k + 2) + (3k + 4) + 3 = 6k + 9 = 3(2k + 3).\]Since this is divisible by 3, the perimeter cannot be prime
This tells us that none of the sides can be equal to 3 either.
Note that $5 + 7 + 11 = 23$ is prime, so the smallest possible perimeter is $\boxed{23}.$
We first note that the given quadrilateral is a trapezoid, because $60^\circ+120^\circ=180^\circ,$ and so the top and bottom sides are parallel
We need to determine the total area of the trapezoid and then what fraction of that area is closest to the longest side.
DETERMINATION OF REGION CLOSEST TO $AD$
Next, we need to determine what region of the trapezoid is closest to side $AD.$ To be closest to side $AD,$ a point inside the trapezoid must be closer to $AD$ than to each of $BC,$ $AB,$ and $DC.$ For a point in the trapezoid to be closer to $AD$ than to $BC,$ it must be below the "half-way mark", which is the midsegment $MN.$ Thus, such a point must be below the parallel line that is $$\frac{1}{2}(50\sqrt{3})=25\sqrt{3}\text{ m}$$above $AD.$
For a point in the trapezoid to be closer to $AD$ than to $AB,$ it must be below the angle bisector of $\angle BAD.$ Similarly, for a point in the trapezoid to be closer to $AD$ than to $DC,$ it must be below the angle bisector of $\angle CDA.$ Define points $X$ and $Y$ to be the points of intersection between the angle bisectors of $\angle BAD$ and $\angle CDA,$ respectively, with the midsegment $MN.$ [asy]

Solution 1: The slick way:
Connecting $B$ and $C$ to the midpoint of $\overline{AD}$ forms three equilateral triangles as shown below:
draw((0,0)--(1/2,sqrt(3)/2)--(3/2,sqrt(3)/2)--(2,0)--(0,0),linewidth(0.8));

draw((1/2,sqrt(3)/2)--(1,0)--(3/2,sqrt(3)/2));
label("$M$",(1,0),S);
[/asy]
$X$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BM}$ and $Y$ is the midpoint of $\overline{CM}.$ Therefore, the region of points closest to $\overline{AD}$ consists of half of triangle $ABM,$ $1/4$ of triangle $BCM$ (since $X$ and $Y$ are midpoints of sides $\overline{BM}$ and $\overline{CM},$ the area of $MXY$ is $1/4$ the area of $BCM$), and half of triangle $CDM$
Each equilateral triangle is $1/3$ of the entire trapezoid, so the region that is closest to $\overline{AD}$ is $$\frac13\left(\frac12+\frac12+\frac14\right) = \boxed{\frac{5}{12}}$$of the entire trapezoid
(Solution from user brokenfixer.)

[/asy] Since $\triangle ABP$ is right-angled at $P$ and $\angle BAP=60^\circ,$ then $$AP = \frac 1 2 \cdot 100=50\text{ m} \quad\text{and}\quad BP = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\cdot 100=50\sqrt{3}\text{ m}.$$(We used the ratios in a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle to do these calculations.) By symmetry, $QD=50\text{ m}$ as well.
Also, since $BC$ is parallel to $PQ,$ and $BP$ and $CQ$ are perpendicular to $PQ,$ then $BPQC$ is a rectangle, so $PQ=BC=100\text{ m}.$ Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $$\frac{1}{2}(BC+AD)(BP)=\frac{1}{2}(100+(50+100+50))(50\sqrt{3})$$or $7500\sqrt{3}$ square meters.
AREA OF TRAPEZOID $AXYD$
Lastly, we need to determine the area of trapezoid $AXYD.$ Note that $$\angle XAD=\angle YDA = \frac{1}{2}(60^\circ)=30^\circ.$$Drop perpendiculars from $X$ and $Y$ to $G$ and $H,$ respectively, on $AD.$ [asy]

When we rotate images $90^{\circ}$ the coordinates switch places, and the signs are adjusted based on whether or not an axis was crossed
In this case, rotating point $A$ $90^{\circ}$ will bring it across the $y$-axis into Quadrant I, which means both the $x$ and $y$ will be positive
The original point $A$ was at $(-4, 1)$ so the final image will be at $(1, 4)$
We also could solve this problem by seeing that the slope of the segment from the origin to $A$ is $-1/4$
If $A$ is moving to a location that is a $90^{\circ}$ rotation about the origin, it will move to a point on the segment perpendicular to the one that currently connects it to the origin
This will be the segment that has a slope of 4/1 or $-4/-1$ from the origin which puts us at $(1, 4)$ or $(-1, -4)$
The point $\boxed{(1, 4)}$ is in the clockwise direction we need.

Let the side length of each square be $s$
Then the perimeter of the polygon is $28s = 56$, so $s = 2$
Hence, the area of the polygon is $25s^2 = \boxed{100}$.
Rotating $360^\circ$ is the same as doing nothing, so rotating $510^\circ$ is the same as rotating $510^\circ - 360^\circ = 150^\circ$
Therefore, we have $\sin 510^\circ = \sin (510^\circ - 360^\circ) = \sin 150^\circ$.
Let $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $150^\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.

Triangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $DP = \frac12$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac12\right)$, so $\sin 510^\circ = \sin 150^\circ = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is \[4\pi r^2.\]  The sphere in question has diameter $8\frac{1}{2}=\frac{17}{2}$, radius $\frac{17}{4}$, and surface area  \[4\pi\left(\frac{17}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{17^2}{4}\pi = \boxed{\frac{289\pi}{4}}.\]
Let $t$ be the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$ (which is what we want to compute).
Since $AX=XY$, we have $\angle AYX = \angle YAX = \angle BAC = t^\circ$
Then, since the sum of angles in $\triangle AXY$ is $180^\circ$, we have $\angle AXY = (180-2t)^\circ$.
Angles $\angle AXY$ and $\angle BXY$ add to form a straight angle, so they are supplementary; $\angle BXY = (180-(180-2t))^\circ = (2t)^\circ$.
Since $XY=YB$, we have $\angle XBY = \angle BXY = (2t)^\circ$
Since the sum of angles in $\triangle XYB$ is $180^\circ$, we have $\angle XYB = (180-4t)^\circ$.
Angles $\angle AYX$, $\angle XYB$, and $\angle BYC$ add to form a straight angle, so their sum is $180^\circ$
Therefore, $\angle BYC = (180-t-(180-4t))^\circ = (3t)^\circ$.
Since $YB=BC$, we have $\angle YCB = \angle BYC = (3t)^\circ$
Since the sum of angles in $\triangle YBC$ is $180^\circ$, we have $\angle YBC = (180-6t)^\circ$.
Finally, $\angle ABC = \angle XBY + \angle YBC = (2t)^\circ + (180-6t)^\circ = (180-4t)^\circ$
We know this is equal to $120^\circ$, so we solve the equation $$180-4t = 120$$ to obtain $t=\boxed{15}$.

Let $F$ be the center of the square base
Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFB$ is a right triangle
The perimeter of the base of the pyramid is 24 inches, so the length of each side of the base is $6$ inches
Since $F$ is the center of the base, $FB$ is half the diagonal of the base, or $(6\sqrt{2})/2 = 3\sqrt{2}$ inches
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $PFB$ gives  \[PF = \sqrt{PB^2 - FB^2} = \sqrt{81 - 18} = \sqrt{63} = \boxed{3\sqrt{7}} \text{ inches}.\]

Since $\angle BAC = 90^\circ$, the circumcenter $O$ of triangle $ABC$ is the midpoint of hypotenuse $BC$.
Since $AE$ and $AF$ are tangents from $A$ to the same circle, $AE = AF$
Let $x = AE = AF$
Similarly, let $y = BD = BF$ and $z = CD = CE$
Then $x + y = AF + BF = AB = 5$, $x + z = AE + CE = AC = 12$, $y + z = BD + CD = BC = 13$
Solving this system of equations, we find $x = 2$, $y = 3$, and $z = 10$
Then $DO = BO - BD = BC/2 - y = 13/2 - 3 = 7/2$.
The inradius $r$ of triangle $ABC$ is given by $r = K/s$, where $K$ is the area of triangle $ABC$, and $s$ is the semi-perimeter
We see that $K = [ABC] = 1/2 \cdot AB \cdot AC = 1/2 \cdot 5 \cdot 12 = 30$, and $s = (AB + AC + BC)/2 = (5 + 12 + 13)/2 = 15$, so $r = 30/15 = 2$.
Hence, by the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $IDO$, \[IO = \sqrt{ID^2 + DO^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + \left( \frac{7}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{65}{4}} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{65}}{2}}.\]
A side of square I has length 3, while a side of square II has length 6 (all sides have equal length)
Therefore, a side of square III has length 9
Since the side length of square I is $\frac{1}{3}$ that of square III, and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their side lengths, the ratio of the area of square I to square III is $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}$

[/asy] We will write the area of triangle $XYZ$ as $[XYZ].$  Since triangles $ADC$ and $BCD$ share a base and have the same altitude length to that base, they have the same area
Since $[BCD] = [ADC]$, we have $[BCE] + [CDE] = [ADE] + [CDE]$, so  $[BCE] = [ADE] = 20$.
To find the area of triangle $CDE$, we note that triangles $CDE$ and $ABE$ are similar, and the ratio of their sides is $DE/BE$
Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$
Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$
Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $[ABE] + [ADE] + [BCE] + [CDE] = 50+20+20+8 = \boxed{98}$.
Since the ratio of the area of $A$ to the shaded area inside $B$ is $1:3$, the ratio of the area of $A$ to the entire area of $B$ is $1:(3+1) = 1:4$
Since the area of $B$ is 4 times the area of $A$, the radius of $B$ is twice the radius of $A$, which means the diameter of $A$ is half the diameter of $B$, or $\boxed{8\text{ cm}}$.
The center of the image circle is simply the center of the original circle reflected over the line $y=x$
When reflecting over this line, we swap the $x$ and $y$ coordinates
Thus, the image center is the point $\boxed{(-5, 6)}$.
If $x$ represents the length of the shorter leg, then the two legs are $x$ and $2x-1$
In a right triangle, the length of one leg is the base and the length of the other leg is the height, so the area of this triangle is $\frac{1}{2}bh=\frac{1}{2}x(2x-1)$
We set this equal to 60 and solve for $x$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2}(2x^2-x)&=60\quad\Rightarrow\\
2x^2-x&=120\quad\Rightarrow\\
2x^2-x-120&=0\quad\Rightarrow\\
(2x+15)(x-8)&=0
\end{align*} Since $x$ must be positive, we get that $x=8$
The shorter leg is 8 feet long and the longer leg is $2(8)-1=15$ feet long
We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse or we recognize that 8 and 15 are part of the Pythagorean triple $8:15:17$
The hypotenuse of the right triangle is $\boxed{17}$ feet long.
If the stripe were cut from the silo and spread flat, it would form a parallelogram 3 feet wide and 80 feet high
So the area of the stripe is $3(80)=\boxed{240}$ square feet.
Notice that neither the diameter of the cylinder nor the number of times the stripe wrapped around the cylinder factored into our computation for the area of the stripe
At first, this may sound counter-intuitive
An area of 240 square feet is what we would expect for a perfectly rectangular stripe that went straight up the side of the cylinder.
However, note that no matter how many times the stripe is wrapped around the cylinder, its base and height (which are perpendicular) are always preserved
So, the area remains the same
Consider the following stripes which have been "unwound" from a cylinder with height 80 feet.

Regardless of how many times the stripes were wrapped around the cylinder, each stripe has base 3 feet and height 80 feet, giving area 240 sq ft.

[/asy] Look at the right triangle that consists of a blue side, a red side, and a grey side
The grey side has length $3$ (half the length of the square side length)
Since the red side has length $2\sqrt{3}$, by Pythagoras the blue side has length $\sqrt{3}$; thus, the right triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle, with area $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(3)(\sqrt{3}) = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
The two red radii slice out a sector of 30 degrees, with area $\left(\frac{30^\circ}{360^\circ}\right)(2\sqrt{3})^2 \pi = \pi$.
The square consists of 8 right triangles and 4 sectors and one grey shaded area
Thus, the grey shaded area has area \[6^2 - 8\left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) - 4\pi = \boxed{36 - 12\sqrt{3} - 4\pi}.\]
Taking one exterior angle per vertex, the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\circ$
If each exterior angle is $30^\circ$, then the polygon has $\frac{360}{30}=12$ sides
The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$, so for a polygon with 12 sides, the sum of the interior angles is $180(12-2)=\boxed{1800}$ degrees.

Triangles $EAB$ and $EDC$ are similar, and the ratio of their corresponding sides is $\frac{CD}{AB} = \frac{17}{8}$
Therefore, we have \[\frac{[EDC]}{[EAB]} = \left(\frac{17}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{289}{64}.\]  Since $[EDC] = [EAB] + [ABCD]$, we have $\frac{[ABCD] + [EAB]}{[EAB]} = \frac{289}{64}$, so \[\frac{[ABCD]}{[EAB]} + 1 = \frac{289}{64}.\] Therefore, $\frac{[ABCD]}{[EAB]} = \frac{225}{64}$, so $\frac{[EAB]}{[ABCD]} = \boxed{\frac{64}{225}}$.
Since $G$ and $H$ are midpoints, we know that $DG=GC$ and $EH=HF.$ From vertical angles, we can see that $\angle DHE\equiv \angle FHJ.$ Finally, from parallel lines, it is clear that $\angle DEH\equiv \angle HFJ.$ We have now found two angles and a side equal in triangles $DEH$ and $JFH,$ so therefore, $\triangle DEH\equiv \triangle JFH.$   Looking at areas, we have: \begin{align*}
[CDEF]&=[CDHF]+[DEH] \\
[CDJ]&=[CDHF]+[HFJ]
\end{align*} However, we just proved that $\triangle DEH\equiv \triangle JFH,$ and so $[HFJ]=[DEH].$ Therefore,$$[CDEF]=[CDJ]=\boxed{36}.$$
Let the cylinder have radius $r$ and height $2r$

Since $\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle, then we may use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $BC$.
Thus, $AB^2=BC^2+CA^2$, and so  \begin{align*}
BC^2&=AB^2-CA^2\\
&=3250^2-3000^2\\
&=250^2(13^2-12^2)\\
&=250^2(5^2)\\
&=1250^2.
\end{align*}therefore $BC=1250$ km (since $BC>0$).
To fly from $A$ to $B$, the cost is $3250\times0.10+100=\$425$
To bus from $A$ to $B$, the cost is $3250\times0.15=\$487.50$
Since Piravena chooses the least expensive way to travel, she will fly from $A$ to $B$.
To fly from $B$ to $C$, the cost is $1250\times0.10+100=\$225$
To bus from $B$ to $C$, the cost is $1250\times0.15=\$187.50$
Since Piravena chooses the least expensive way to travel, she will bus from $B$ to $C$.
To fly from $C$ to $A$, the cost is $3000\times0.10+100=\$400$
To bus from $C$ to $A$, the cost is $3000\times0.15=\$450$
Since Piravena chooses the least expensive way to travel, she will fly from $C$ to $A$.
The total cost of the trip would be $\$425+\$187.50+\$400=\boxed{\$1012.50}$.

Let the center of the hemisphere be $O$, and let $A$ be a point on the circumference of the top circle of the cylinder
Since the cylinder is inscribed in the hemisphere, $A$ lies on the hemisphere as well, so $OA=5$
We drop a perpendicular from $A$ to the base of the hemisphere and let it intersect the base of the hemisphere at $B$
Since the cylinder is right and $AB$ is a height of the cylinder, $\angle OBA$ is a right angle, and $B$ lies on the circumference of the bottom circle of the cylinder
Thus, $OB$ is a radius of the cylinder, so $OB=2$
We have that $\triangle OBA$ is right, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \[AB=\sqrt{OA^2-OB^2}=\sqrt{5^2-2^2}=\sqrt{21}.\]Thus, the height of the cylinder is $\boxed{\sqrt{21}}$.
First, let us denote the radius of cylinder A (and height of cylinder B) as $r$, and the height of cylinder A (and radius of cylinder B) as $h$
Therefore, if the volume of cylinder A is double that of B, then: $\frac{\text{Volume of Cylinder A}}{\text{Volume of Cylinder B}} = \frac{r^2 \cdot h}{h^2 \cdot r} = \frac{r}{h} = 2$
Therefore, normally the volume of Cylinder A is expressed as $\pi \cdot r^2 \cdot h$, and plugging in $r = 2h$, we see that the volume of Cylinder A $= 4\pi \cdot h^3$, hence $N = \boxed{4}$.
The probability of winning on one spin is equal to the ratio of the area of the WIN sector to the area of the entire circle
The area of the entire circle is $\pi \cdot 10^2 = 100\pi$
In math terms, our ratio is: $\frac{2}{5}=\frac{\text{area of the win sector}}{100\pi}$
Solving for the area of the win sector, we find it equal to $\boxed{40\pi}$ square centimeters.
The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}$
This must equal $s$
Setting the two equal and solving, we get \begin{align*}
s&=\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} \\
4s&=s^2\sqrt{3} \\
4 &= s\sqrt{3} \\
4\sqrt{3}&= 3s \\
\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} &=s
\end{align*} Thus, the perimeter of the triangle is $3s=\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} \cdot 3 = \boxed{4\sqrt{3}} \text{units}$.
The perimeter of the shaded region equals the sum of the lengths of $OP$ and $OQ$ plus the length of arc $PQ$.
Each of $OP$ and $OQ$ has length 5.
Arc $PQ$ forms $\frac{3}{4}$ of the circle with center $O$ and radius 5, because the missing portion corresponds to a central angle of $90^\circ$, and so is $\frac{1}{4}$ of the total circle.
Thus, the length of arc $PQ$ is $\frac{3}{4}$ of the circumference of this circle, or $\frac{3}{4}(2\pi(5))=\frac{15}{2}\pi$
Therefore, the perimeter is $5+5+\frac{15}{2}\pi = \boxed{10 + \frac{15}{2}\pi}$.
Let $O$ and $O'$ denote the centers of the smaller and larger circles, respectively
Let $D$ and $D'$ be the points on $\overline{AC}$ that are also on the smaller and larger circles, respectively
Since $\triangle ADO$ and $\triangle AD'O'$ are similar right triangles, we have \[
\frac{AO}{1}= \frac{AO'}{2}= \frac{AO+3}{2}, \quad\text{so}\quad AO = 3.
\]As a consequence, \[
AD = \sqrt{AO^2 - OD^2} = \sqrt{9-1}= 2\sqrt{2}.

Let  $F$ be the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$
Since $\triangle ADO$ and $\triangle AFC$ are similar right triangles, we have \[
\frac{FC}{1}= \frac{AF}{AD} = \frac{AO + OO' + O'F}{AD} = \frac{3 + 3 + 2}{2\sqrt{2}}= 2\sqrt{2}.
\]So the area of $\triangle ABC$ is \[
\frac{1}{2}\cdot BC\cdot AF = \frac{1}{2}\cdot 4\sqrt{2}\cdot 8 = \boxed{16\sqrt{2}}.
Since $AB = BD,$ we see that $\triangle ABD$ is an isosceles right triangle, therefore $\angle DAB = 45^\circ.$ That means that $AD$, and consequently $AE,$ bisects $\angle CAB.$
Relating our areas to side lengths and applying the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have that: \begin{align*}
\frac{[\triangle ABE]}{[\triangle ACE]} &= \frac{EB}{EC} = \frac{AB}{AC} \\
\frac{[\triangle ABE]}{[\triangle ACE]} + 1 &= \frac{AB}{AC} + 1 \\
\frac{[\triangle ABE] + [\triangle ACE]}{[\triangle ACE]} &= \frac{AB + AC}{AC} \\
\frac{[\triangle ABC]}{[\triangle ACE]} &= \frac{6 + 10}{10} = \frac{8}{5}.
\end{align*} Now, we see that $[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 10 = 30,$ so $[\triangle ACE] = \frac{5}{8} \cdot [\triangle ABC] = \frac{5}{8} \cdot 30 = \boxed{\frac{75}{4}}.$

Reflecting a point over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coefficient
So if $A$ is $(1,-3)$, $A'$ will be $(-1, -3)$
The segment is a horizontal line of length $1+1=\boxed{2}$.
If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we look for the volume $lwh$
We arbitrarily set $lw=6$, $wh=8$, and $lh=12$
Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=6\cdot8\cdot12=3\cdot2\cdot2^3\cdot2^2\cdot3=2^6\cdot3^2$
To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^3\cdot3=\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.
We first extend line segment $\overline{CP}$ so that it intersects $\overline{AB}$
We'll call this point of intersection point $E$, so $\overline{CE}$ is a perpendicular bisector to segment $\overline{AB}$ and $AE=EB=3$
We also let $x =$ the lengths of segments $\overline{PA}$, $\overline{PB}$, and $\overline{PC}$, so line segment $\overline{PE}$ will have length $6-x$
Now we have that $\triangle AEP$ is a right triangle
Using the Pythagorean Theorem and solving for $x$, we have that:  \begin{align*}
& AE^2+PE^2=PA^2 \\
\Rightarrow \qquad & 3^2 + (6-x)^2 = x^2 \\
\Rightarrow \qquad & 9 + 36 - 12x + x^2 = x^2 \\
\Rightarrow \qquad & 12x = 45 \\
\Rightarrow \qquad & x= \frac{15}{4}.
\end{align*}  Thus, $\triangle APB$ has base $6$ and a a height of $6-x=6-\frac{15}{4}=\frac{9}{4}$
It follows that $\triangle APB$ has an area of $\dfrac{1}{2}bh=\dfrac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot \left(\dfrac{9}{4}\right) = \boxed{\dfrac{27}{4}}$ square inches.
Prime factorize $385$ as $5\cdot7\cdot 11$
The surface area of a rectangular solid having side lengths of 5, 7, and 11 units is $2(5\cdot7+7\cdot11+11\cdot5)=\boxed{334}$ square units.
The handrail encases a right circular cylinder with radius 3 feet and height 10 feet
Its lateral area is a rectangle with height 10 feet and width equal to its base circumference, or $2\pi\cdot 3 = 6\pi$ feet
A staircase that turns $360^\circ$ would, when unrolled and lain flat, span the diagonal of this rectangle
However, our staircase does not make a full turn, so it spans a rectangle with a shorter width.
A $270^\circ$ sector of a circle with radius 3 has arc length $\frac{270^\circ}{360^\circ}\cdot 2\pi\cdot 3 = 4.5\pi$
Thus, when unrolled and lain flat, our handrail spans the diagonal of a rectangle with height 10 feet and width $4.5\pi$ feet
Our handrail has length $\sqrt{10^2+(4.5\pi)^2} \approx 17.317$ feet
To the nearest tenth, this value is $\boxed{17.3}$ feet.
Let $AB = x$ and $AC = y$
Then we can write two Pythagorean equations from the information given: $(x/3)^2 + y^2 = 28^2$ and $x^2 + (y/3)^2 = 16^2$
These equations become $x^2/9 + y^2 = 784$ and $x^2 + y^2/9 = 256$
Multiplying them both by 9, we get $x^2 + 9y^2= 7056$ and $9x^2 + y^2
= 2304$
Now we add the two equations to get $10x^2 + 10y^2 = 9360$, which can be reduced to $x^2
+ y^2 = 936$
We do not need to solve for $x$ and $y$ since 936 is the square of the hypotenuse $BC$
The length is thus $\sqrt{936} = \sqrt{(36 \times 26)} = \sqrt{36} \times \sqrt{26} = \boxed{6\sqrt{26}}$ units.
First notice that this is a right triangle, so two of the altitudes are the legs, whose lengths are $15$ and $20$
The third altitude, whose length is  $x$, is the one drawn to the hypotenuse
The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(15)(20) = 150$
Using 25 as the base and $x$ as the altitude, we have $$
\frac{1}{2}(25)x = 150, \quad \text{so} \quad
x = \frac{300}{25} = \boxed{12}.

Let $s$ represent the sidelength of the equilateral triangular base
Each face of the pyramid has an area of $\frac{1}{2}bh=75$, where $b$ is the sidelength of the base and $h$ is the slant height of 30 meters
We have  $$75=\frac{1}{2}s(30)=15s.$$So, $s=5$ and the sidelength of the base is $\boxed{5}$ meters.

Since altitudes $\overline{AX}$ and $\overline{BY}$ intersect at $H$, point $H$ is the orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$
Therefore, the line through $C$ and $H$ is perpendicular to side $\overline{AB}$, as shown
Therefore, we have $$\angle CHX= 90^\circ - \angle HCX = 90^\circ - \angle ZCB = \angle ZBC = \boxed{73^\circ}.$$
Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $3x$, $4x$, and $5x$
The triangle is a right triangle, so its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle
Thus $5x=2\cdot 3=6$, so $x=6/5$
The area of the triangle is \[
\frac{1}{2}\cdot 3x\cdot 4x =\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{18}{5}\cdot \frac{24}{5}
=\frac{216}{25}=\boxed{8.64}.\]
In hexagon $ABCDEF$, let $AB=BC=CD=3$ and let $DE=EF=FA=5$
Since arc $BAF$ is one third of the circumference of the circle, it follows that $\angle BCF = \angle BEF=60^{\circ}$
Similarly, $\angle CBE =\angle CFE=60^{\circ}$
Let $P$ be the intersection of $\overline{BE}$ and $\overline{CF}$, $Q$ that of $\overline{BE}$ and $\overline{AD}$, and $R$ that of $\overline{CF}$ and $\overline{AD}$
Triangles $EFP$ and  $BCP$ are equilateral, and by symmetry, triangle $PQR$ is isosceles and thus also equilateral

Furthermore, $\angle BAD$ and $\angle BED$ subtend the same arc, as do $\angle ABE$ and $\angle ADE$
Hence triangles $ABQ$ and $EDQ$ are similar
Therefore, $$\frac{AQ}{EQ}=\frac{BQ}{DQ}=\frac{AB}{ED}=\frac{3}{5}.$$ It follows that $$\frac{\frac{AD-PQ}{2}}{PQ+5} =\frac{3}{5}\quad
\mbox {and}\quad \frac{3-PQ}{\frac{AD+PQ}{2}}=\frac{3}{5}.$$ Solving the two equations simultaneously  yields $AD=360/49,$ so $m+n=\boxed{409}$.
Since $PQ=2$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $PQ$, then $PM = MQ =\frac{1}{2}(2)=1$.
Since $\triangle PQR$ is right-angled at $P$, then by the Pythagorean Theorem,  \[ RQ = \sqrt{PQ^2+PR^2} = \sqrt{2^2+(2\sqrt{3})^2}=\sqrt{4+12}=\sqrt{16}=4
\](Note that we could say that $\triangle PQR$ is a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle, but we do not actually need this fact.)
Since $PL$ is an altitude, then $\angle PLR = 90^\circ$, so $\triangle RLP$ is similar to $\triangle RPQ$ (these triangles have right angles at $L$ and $P$ respectively, and a common angle at $R$).
Therefore, $\frac{PL}{QP}=\frac{RP}{RQ}$ or $PL = \frac{(QP)(RP)}{RQ}= \frac{2(2\sqrt{3})}{4}=\sqrt{3}$.
Similarly, $\frac{RL}{RP} = \frac{RP}{RQ}$ so $RL = \frac{(RP)(RP)}{RQ} = \frac{(2\sqrt{3})(2\sqrt{3})}{4}=3$.
Therefore, $LQ=RQ-RL=4-3=1$ and $PF = PL - FL = \sqrt{3}-FL$.
So we need to determine the length of $FL$.
Drop a perpendicular from $M$ to $X$ on $RQ$.
draw((5,0)--(8.75,2.17)); label("$X$",(8.75,2.17),NE);

[/asy]
Then $\triangle MXQ$ is similar to $\triangle PLQ$, since these triangles are each right-angled and they share a common angle at $Q$
Since $MQ = \frac{1}{2}PQ$, then the corresponding sides of $\triangle MXQ$ are half as long as those of $\triangle PLQ$.
Therefore, $QX=\frac{1}{2}QL=\frac{1}{2}(1)=\frac{1}{2}$ and $MX = \frac{1}{2}PL = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{3})=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
Since $QX=\frac{1}{2}$, then $RX = RQ-QX = 4 - \frac{1}{2}=\frac{7}{2}$.
Now $\triangle RLF$ is similar to $\triangle RXM$ (they are each right-angled and share a common angle at $R$).
Therefore, $\frac{FL}{MX}=\frac{RL}{RX}$ so $FL = \frac{(MX)(RL)}{RX}=\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(3)}{\frac{7}{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{7}$.
Thus, $PF = \sqrt{3} - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{7} = \boxed{\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{7}}$.
Connect the midpoints of the sides of the equilateral triangle as shown
The triangle is divided into four congruent equilateral triangles, and the isosceles trapezoid is made up of 3 of these 4 triangles
Therefore, the ratio of the area of one of the triangles to the area of the trapezoid is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

If we extend the pattern, we note that the rearrangements of the vertices return to the original order after four steps: ABCD $\rightarrow$ DABC $\rightarrow$ CBAD $\rightarrow$ DCBA $\rightarrow$ ABCD
Thus, since the sequence repeats, we know that every fourth rearrangement will be of the form DCBA
The 2007th square is one before the 2008th, which is the fourth arrangement (since 2008 is divisible by 4)
Thus, the 2007th square will be of the form that is one before DCBA; namely, $\boxed{\text{CBAD}}$.
Since we have a right triangle, we can see that any circle with center on $AB$ is tangent to $BC$ at the right angle itself, or $B.$ Since $P$ is the point at which $AC$ and the circle meet, we see that $CP$ is a tangent from $C,$ as is $BC.$ That means $BC = CP.$ We can easily find $BC$ via the Pythagorean Theorem, as $AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2.$ Plugging in $(5)^2 + BC^2 = (\sqrt{61})^2,$ we can find $BC = CP = \boxed{6}.$
To solve the problem, we compute the area of regular pentagon $ABCDE$ in two different ways
First, we can divide regular pentagon $ABCDE$ into five congruent triangles.

B = dir(90 - 360/5);

label("$Q$", Q, dir(0));
label("$R$", R, W);
label("$1$", (O + P)/2, dir(0));
[/asy]
If $s$ is the side length of the regular pentagon, then each of the triangles $AOB$, $BOC$, $COD$, $DOE$, and $EOA$ has base $s$ and height 1, so the area of regular pentagon $ABCDE$ is $5s/2$.
Next, we divide regular pentagon $ABCDE$ into triangles $ABC$, $ACD$, and $ADE$.
unitsize(2 cm);
pair A, B, C, D, E, O, P, Q, R;
A = dir(90);
B = dir(90 - 360/5);

Triangle $ACD$ has base $s$ and height $AP = AO + 1$
Triangle $ABC$ has base $s$ and height $AQ$
Triangle $ADE$ has base $s$ and height $AR$
Therefore, the area of regular pentagon $ABCDE$ is also \[\frac{s}{2} (AO + AQ + AR + 1).\]Hence, \[\frac{s}{2} (AO + AQ + AR + 1) = \frac{5s}{2},\]which means $AO + AQ + AR + 1 = 5$, or $AO + AQ + AR = \boxed{4}$.
To begin, we need to visualize the cylinder inscribed in the sphere
We can draw the cylinder as shown: [asy]
size(150);
draw((0,0)--(6,0)--(6,8)--(0,8)--cycle,linewidth(.7));
draw((0,8)--(6,0),linewidth(.7));
draw((0,0)..(3,-1.5)..(6,0),linewidth(.7));
draw((0,0)..(3,1.5)..(6,0),linewidth(.7));
draw((0,8)..(3,9.5)..(6,8),linewidth(.7));
draw((0,8)..(3,6.5)..(6,8),linewidth(.7));
label("6",(3,8),N);
label("10",(3,4),NE);
[/asy] A diagonal drawn in the cylinder will have length 10, which is the diameter of the sphere
We can see that a 6-8-10 right triangle is formed by the height of the cylinder, the diameter of the sphere, and the diameter of the base of the cylinder
Now that we know the height of the cylinder, we have everything we need to compute the desired volume: $$V_{sphere}=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3=\frac{4}{3}\cdot \pi\cdot 5^3=\frac{500\pi}{3}$$$$V_{cylinder}=\pi r^2\cdot h=\pi \cdot 3^2\cdot 8=72\pi .$$The volume inside the sphere and outside the cylinder is the difference of the above values: $$V_{sphere}-V_{cylinder}=\frac{500\pi}{3}-72\pi =\frac{500\pi-216\pi}{3}=\boxed{\frac{284}{3}}\pi .$$
We find $CE$ by first finding $BE$.
Since $AE = 24$ and $\angle AEB = 60^\circ$ and $AEB$ is a right triangle, then we can see that $AE$ is the hypotenuse and $BE$ is the shorter leg, so $BE = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot 24 = 12.$
Likewise, since $BE = 12$ and $\angle BEC = 60^\circ$, then $CE = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot 12 = \boxed{6}$.
The volume of the sphere is \[\frac{4}{3}\pi p^3\] and the volume of the hemisphere is \[\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi (2p)^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi p^3 \cdot 4.\] Thus the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the hemisphere is $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
Let $h$ be the length of the altitude from $A$ in $\triangle ABC$
Then \[
2007=\frac{1}{2}\cdot BC\cdot h=\frac{1}{2}\cdot 223\cdot h,
\]so $h=18$
Thus $A$ is on one of the lines $y=18$ or $y=-18$.

Line $DE$ has equation $x-y-300=0$
Let $A$ have coordinates $(a,b)$
By the formula for the distance from a point to a line, the distance from $A$ to line $DE$ is $|a-b-300 |/\sqrt{2}$
The area of $\triangle ADE$ is \[
7002=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{| a-b-300 |}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot DE
=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{| a\pm 18-300 |}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot 9\sqrt{2}.
\]Thus $a=\pm 18 \pm 1556 + 300$, and the sum of the four possible values of $a$ is $4\cdot300=\boxed{1200}$.

Without loss of generality, we assume that $AC > AB$, as in the diagram
From the given information, we know that $AC = 8$, $BC = 10$, and $DC = 8-x$
We can find that $AG = AB\cdot AC/BC = 4.8$.
From similar triangles $AED$ and $ABC$, we find that $s/10 = x/8$
From similar triangles $DFC$ and $AGC$, we have $s/4.8 = (8-x)/8$
Summing these two equations, we have $$\frac{s}{10} + \frac{s}{4.8} = \frac{x}{8} + \frac{8-x}{8}$$$$\frac{14.8s}{48} = 1.$$Solving for $s$, we find that $s = \boxed{\frac{120}{37}}$.
Let $M_1$, $M_2$, and $M_3$ be the midpoints of $AP$, $BP$, and $CP$, respectively
Then as a midline in triangle $PBC$, $M_2 M_3$ is parallel to $BC$, and half the length of $BC$.

Since $G_3$ is the centroid of triangle $PAB$, $G_3$ divides median $AM_2$ in the ratio $2:1$
Similarly, $G_2$ divides median $AM_3$ in the ratio $2:1$
Therefore, triangles $AG_3 G_2$ and $AM_2 M_3$ are similar
Also, $G_2 G_3$ is parallel to $M_2 M_3$, and $G_2 G_3$ is two-thirds the length of $M_2 M_3$.
Therefore, $G_2 G_3$ is parallel to $BC$, and $G_2 G_3$ is one-third the length of $BC$
Likewise, $G_1 G_2$ is parallel to $AB$, and $G_1 G_2$ is one-third the length of $AB$
Hence, triangle $G_1 G_2 G_3$ is similar to triangle $ABC$, with ratio of similarity 1/3
The area of triangle $ABC$ is 18, so the area of triangle $G_1 G_2 G_3$ is $18 \cdot (1/3)^2 = \boxed{2}$.
Label the lower right corner of the square point $D$ and the lower left corner $E$
The interior angles of a regular hexagon are 120 degrees and the interior angles of a square are 90 degrees
Thus, $m\angle BDC=m \angle BDE - m\angle CDE=120^\circ - 90^\circ = 30^\circ$
In addition, because the square and regular hexagon share a side and all of their sides have the same length, segments $CD$ and $BD$ have the same length
Thus, triangle $BCD$ is isosceles.
Because the base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent, $m\angle BCD = m \angle CBD=x$
In addition, because the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have  \begin{align*}
180^\circ &= m\angle BDC+m\angle BCD + m\angle CBD \\
&=30^\circ + x + x \\
150^\circ &= 2x \\
75^\circ = x
\end{align*} Thus, $m\angle CBD=75^\circ$
Finally, we calculate $m\angle ABC=m\angle ABD- m\angle CBD=120^\circ-75^\circ=\boxed{45}^\circ$.
There are 6 faces to a cube, meaning that each face has area 36, and the edge has length 6, for a total volume of $6^3 = \boxed{216}$ for the cube.
Let $d$ be the diameter of the inscribed circle, and let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle
Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=12$
Let $K$ denote the area of $\triangle ABC$.
Heron's formula tells us that \begin{align*}
K &= \sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\
&= \sqrt{12\cdot 1\cdot 6\cdot 5} \\
&= \sqrt{6^2\cdot 10} \\
&= 6\sqrt{10}.
\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\sqrt{10} = r\cdot 12,$$which yields the radius $r=\frac {\sqrt{10}}{2}$
This yields the diameter $d = \boxed{\sqrt{10}}$.
First we draw diagonal $\overline{BD}$, and let the diagonals intersect at $T$, as shown:

Since $\overline{CT}$ and $\overline{BM}$ are medians of $\triangle BCD$, point $O$ is the centroid of $\triangle BCD$, so $OC= (2/3)CT$
Since $T$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AC}$, we have $CT = AC/2$, so $OC= (2/3)CT = (2/3)(AC/2) = AC/3$
Since $\overline{OC}$ is $\frac13$ of $\overline{AC}$, we know that $\overline{OA}$ is the other $\frac23$ of $\overline{AC}$, which means $OC/OA = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
The cross section of the cone is an equilateral triangle
The ratio of the base to the height of an equilateral triangle is 1 to $\sqrt{3}/2$
In terms of the radius, $r$, the base is $2r$ and the height is $2r\sqrt{3}/2$, or $r\sqrt{3}$
Since we know the volume of the cone, we can use the volume formula and solve the equation  \[(1/3) \times \pi \times r^2 \times r\sqrt{3} = 12288\pi\]  for $r$
Dividing both sides of the equation by $\pi$ gives  $(1/3)r^3\sqrt{3} = 12288$
Tripling both sides, we get $r^3\sqrt{3} = 36,\!864$
Now, we want $r\sqrt{3},$ so we multiply both sides by $3$ to get $r^3\cdot(\sqrt{3})^3 = (r\sqrt{3})^3 = 36,\!864 \cdot 3 = 110,\!592.$ Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $r\sqrt{3} = \boxed{48.0}.$
Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line
Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line
The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$
The line of refection is $\boxed{y = -1}$.
We have $\angle B = \angle PTQ$ and $\angle TPQ = 180^\circ - \angle QPA - \angle APB = 90^\circ - \angle APB = \angle BAP$
Therefore, $\triangle BAP \sim \triangle TPQ$
Since $AB/AP = 4/5$, triangles $BAP$ and $PTQ$ are $\{3,4,5\}$ right triangles, and we have $TQ = \frac35(15) = 9$ and $TP = \frac45(15)=12$
Since $ABCD$ is a rectangle and $TS$ is perpendicular to $BC$, then $ABTS$ is also a rectangle
Thus, $TS=BA=16$ and $QS=TS-QT=16-9=7$.
In triangles $PQT$ and $DQS$, $\angle PTQ=\angle DSQ=90^{\circ}$
Also, $\angle PQT$ and $\angle DQS$ are vertically opposite angles and are therefore equal
Therefore, $\triangle PQT$ and $\triangle DQS$ are similar triangles
Since $\triangle PQT$ and $\triangle DQS$ are similar triangles, the ratios of corresponding side lengths in these two triangles are equal.
That is, $\dfrac{SD}{TP}=\dfrac{QS}{QT}$ or $\dfrac{SD}{12}=\dfrac{7}{9}$ or $SD=12\times\dfrac{7}{9}=\boxed{\dfrac{28}{3}}$.
The line through $B$ that cuts the area of $\triangle ABC$ in half is the median -- that is, the line through $B$ and the midpoint $M$ of $\overline{AC}$
(This line cuts the area of the triangle in half, because if we consider $\overline{AC}$ as its base, then the height of each of $\triangle AMB$ and $\triangle CMB$ is equal to the distance of point $B$ from the line through $A$ and $C$
These two triangles also have equal bases because $AM=MC$, so their areas must be equal.)
The midpoint $M$ of $\overline{AC}$ has coordinates $\left(\frac{1}{2}(0+8),\frac{1}{2}(8+0)\right)=(4,4)$
The line through $B(2,0)$ and $M(4,4)$ has slope $\frac{4-0}{4-2}=2$, and since this line passes through $B(2,0)$, it has equation $y-0=2(x-2)$ or $y=2x-4$
Finally, the desired sum of the slope and $y$-intercept is $2+(-4)=\boxed{-2}$.
Let $r$, $s$, and $t$ be the radii of the circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively
Then $r+s=3$, $r+t=4$, and $s+t=5$
Adding these three equations gives $2(r+s+t) = 12$, so $r+s+t = 6$
Combining this with the original three equations, we get $r=1$, $s=2$, and $t=3$
Thus the sum of the areas of the circles is \[
\pi(1^2+2^2+3^2)=\boxed{14\pi}.
We start by drawing a diagram
When the paper is folded, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide on the longer dashed line, and points $A$ and $C$ meet at $G$, as you can see below
draw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle);
draw((0,0)--(1,.4)); draw((0,0)--(.4,1));
draw((1,.4)--(.4,1),dashed);
draw((0,0)--(.7,.7),dashed);
label("$A$",(0,1), NW); label("$B$",(1,1), NE); label("$C$",(1,0), SE); label("$D$",(0,0), SW);
label("$F$",(1,.4), E); label("$E$",(.4,1), N);
label("$G$",(.7,.7), NE);
[/asy] Now, we assign variables
We are looking for the length of $AE$, so let $AE=x$
Then, $BE=1-x$
Because of the symmetry of the square and the fold, everything to the left of line $BD$ is a mirror image of everything to the right of $BD$
Thus, $\triangle BEF$ is an isosceles right triangle (45-45-90), so $EF=\sqrt{2}EB = \sqrt{2}(1-x)$
Also, $\triangle EGB$ and $\triangle FGB$ are congruent 45-45-90 triangles, so $GB = \frac{EB}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{(1-x)}{\sqrt{2}}$.
Also, notice that because the way the paper is folded (its original position versus its final position), we have more congruent triangles, $\triangle AED \cong \triangle GED$
This means that $AD=GD=1$.
Lastly, notice that since $G$ is on $BD$, we have $BD=BG+GD$
$BD$ is a diagonal of the square, so it has side length $\sqrt{2}$, $GD=1$, and $GB = \frac{(1-x)}{\sqrt{2}}$
Thus, our equation becomes \[\sqrt{2} = 1 + \frac{(1-x)}{\sqrt{2}}.\] Multiplying both sides by $\sqrt{2}$ yields $2=\sqrt{2}+1-x$; solving for $x$ yields $x=\sqrt{2}-1$
Thus, $AE=\sqrt{2}-1=\sqrt{k}-m$, and we see that $k+m=2+1=\boxed{3}$.
Suppose that the altitude from $F$ to $EG$ intersects $EG$ at point $H$
Then $\triangle EAB \sim \triangle EHF$, and we have that $\frac{HE}{HF} = \frac{AE}{AB}$
Also, $\triangle GDC \sim GHF$, and $\frac{HG}{HF} = \frac{DG}{DC}$
Adding these equalities, we find that $\frac{HE + HG}{HF} = \frac{AE + DG}{AB}$, since $AB = DC$
But $HE + HG = EG = 10$, $HF = 7$, and finally $AE + DG = EG - AD = 10 - 2AB$
Plugging in, we find that $\frac{10}{7} = \frac{10-2AB}{AB}$, or $AB = \frac{35}{12}$
Thus the area of $ABCD$ is $\frac{35}{12}\cdot\frac{35}{6} =\boxed{ \frac{1225}{72}}$.
Writing $BP=x$ and $PD=6-x$, we have that $BP < 3$
Power of a point at $P$ gives $AP \cdot PC = BP \cdot PD$ or $8=x(6-x)$
This can be solved for $x=2$ and $x=4$, and we discard the latter, leaving $BP = \boxed{2}$.
Let $D$ be the vertex opposite $B$ on the bottom face, and let $C$ be one of the other two vertices on the bottom face
Because $BCD$ is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to get $BD=\sqrt{10^2+20^2}$
Then applying the Pythagorean theorem to right triangle $BDA$, we find \begin{align*} AB&=\sqrt{10^2+\left(\sqrt{10^2+20^2}\right)^2}\\&=\sqrt{10^2+10^2+20^2}\\&=\sqrt{600}=\boxed{10\sqrt{6}} \text{ inches}.\end{align*}

[/asy] We know that the gray area above (quadrilateral $BEGF$) has area $34$, and we wish to determine the pink area ($\triangle GCD$).
First we note that $\triangle AED$ has base $AD$, equal to the side length of square $ABCD$, and also has height equal to the side length of square $ABCD$
Thus $\triangle AED$ has area equal to half the area of $ABCD$, or $100$.
Triangle $\triangle FEG$ has half the base and half the height of $\triangle AED$, so its area is $\frac12\cdot\frac 12\cdot 100 = 25$.
Since quadrilateral $BEGF$ can be divided into $\triangle FEG$ and $\triangle FBE$, we know that $\triangle FBE$ has area $34-25=9$
This is half the area of $\triangle ABE$ (which shares an altitude with $\triangle FBE$ and has twice the corresponding base)
Thus, $\triangle ABE$ has area $18$.
Since square $ABCD$ can be divided into triangles $ABE$, $AED$, and $ECD$, we know that the area of $\triangle ECD$ is $200-100-18 = 82$
Finally, $\triangle GCD$ shares an altitude with $\triangle ECD$ and has half the corresponding base, so the area of $\triangle GCD$ is $\frac 12\cdot 82$, or $\boxed{41}$.
Let's call the length of the shorter leg $x$
Then the length of the longer leg is $x + 1$
Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we write the equation $x^2 + (x + 1)^2 = 29^2$ and solve for $x$
Expanding $(x + 1)^2$, we get $x
^2 + x^2 + 2x + 1 = 841$
This can be simplified to $2x^2 + 2x = 840$, or $x^2 + x = 420$
Factoring out $x$ on the left, we can rewrite it as $x(x + 1) = 420$
In other words, the product of these two consecutive numbers is 420, which means they must each be close to the square root of 420
Indeed, $20 \times 21 = 420$, so the legs must be 20 and 21
Their sum is $20 + 21 = \boxed{41}$.

pO = (0, 10);

label("$D$", pD, NE);
[/asy] Since $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, that makes $\angle BDC$ a right angle
Then, by $AA$ similarity, we see that $\triangle ADB \sim \triangle BDC \sim \triangle ABC.$ Then, $\frac{BD}{AD} = \frac{CD}{BD},$ so $CD = \frac{BD^2}{AD} = \frac{4^2}{1} = \boxed{16}.$
Since $\cos R = \frac{4}{9}$ and $\cos R = \frac{QR}{RS}=\frac{QR}{9}$, we have $\frac{QR}{9} = \frac{4}{9}$, so $QR = 4$
Then, by the Pythagorean Theorem, $QS = \sqrt{RS^2 - QR^2} = \sqrt{81-16} = \boxed{\sqrt{65}}$.
If the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism are $a$, $b$, and $c$, then we are given $ab=48$, $bc=49$, and $ac=50$
Since we are looking for $abc$, the volume of the rectangular prism, we multiply these three equations to find \begin{align*}
(ab)(bc)(ac)&=48\cdot49\cdot50 \implies \\
a^2b^2c^2&=48\cdot49\cdot 50 \implies \\
(abc)^2 &= 48\cdot49\cdot50 \implies \\
abc &= \sqrt{48\cdot49\cdot50} \\
&= \sqrt{(16\cdot 3)\cdot 7^2\cdot(2\cdot 5^2)} \\
&= 4\cdot7\cdot5\sqrt{2\cdot3} \\
&= 140\sqrt{6},
\end{align*} which to the nearest whole number is $\boxed{343}$ cubic units.

Hence they are each isosceles, and each has area $(1/2)\left(2^2\right)=2$
Angles $CAE$ and $DBF$ are each $45^\circ$, so sectors $CAE$ and $DBF$ each have area \[
\frac{1}{8}\cdot \pi \cdot 2^2 = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]   Thus the  area of the shaded  region is \[
8\sqrt{2}-2\cdot 2 -2\cdot\frac{\pi}{2}=\boxed{8\sqrt{2}-4-\pi}.
Let $\overline{CH}$  be an altitude of $\triangle ABC$

\] Thus $BD = \boxed{3}$.

The cylindrical sculpture has radius two inches and uses $\pi(2^2)(7)=28\pi \approx 87.96$ cubic inches of modeling clay
Each block contains $(6)(2)(1)=12$ cubic inches of modeling clay
If we have 7 blocks, then we have 84 cubic inches of clay which is not enough, so we need $\boxed{8}$ blocks of clay, and we see 96 cubic inches are indeed enough.
The area of triangle $ABE$ is $\frac{1}{2}(\text{base})(\text{height})=\frac{1}{2}(BE)(20\text{ in.})$
Setting this equal to $100$ square inches we find $BE=10$ inches
The area of triangle $ACD$ is $100-75=25$ square inches
Since triangle $ACD$ is similar to triangle $ABE$ and the ratio of their areas is $\frac{1}{4}$, the ratio of corresponding side lengths is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{1}{2}$
Therefore, $CD=\frac{1}{2}BE=\boxed{5}$ inches.
Alternatively, because triangles $ACD$ and $ABE$ are similar, the height-to-base ratio is the same for each of them
In triangle $ABE$, this ratio is $\frac{20\text{ in.}}{10\text{ in.}}=2$
Therefore, the height of $ACD$ is $2\cdot CD$
Solving $\frac{1}{2}(2\cdot CD)(CD)=25\text{ in.}^2$ we find $CD=5$ inches.
There are several ways to proceed, and here is one
Since $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ are both isosceles, it should be easy to find that $\angle B = \angle C = 80^\circ$ and $\angle E = \angle F = 75^\circ.$ Now, connect $C$ and $E$:
import olympiad;
import math;
// Draw triangles
pair A = (0, 1);
pair B = (-cos(1.3962), 0);
pair C = (cos(1.3962), 0);
pair D = (2, 1);
pair E = (2-cos(1.3089), 0);
pair F = (2+cos(1.3089), 0);

label('$A$',A,N);
label('$B$',B,S);
label('$C$',C,S);
label('$D$',D,N);
label('$E$',E,S);
label('$F$',F,S);
[/asy] Since the two triangular wedges have the same height, we see that $AD \parallel CE,$ thus $\angle DAC = \angle ACB = 80^\circ.$ Likewise, $\angle ADE = \angle DEF = 75^\circ.$ Therefore, our answer is $\angle DAC + \angle ADE = 80^\circ + 75^\circ = \boxed{155^\circ}.$
The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$
For a regular hexagon, the interior angles sum to $180(4)$, so each interior angle has a measure of $\frac{180(4)}{6}=30\cdot4=120^\circ$
Since $\overline{PO}$ and $\overline{PQ}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, $\triangle POQ$ is an isosceles triangle
The two base angles are congruent and sum to a degree measure of $180-120=60^\circ$, so each base angle has a measure of $30^\circ$
There are now a couple approaches to finishing the problem.
$\emph{Approach 1}$: We use the fact that trapezoid $PQLO$ is an isosceles trapezoid to solve for $x$ and $y$
Since $\overline{PO}$ and $\overline{QL}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, trapezoid $PQLO$ is an isosceles trapezoid and the base angles are equal
So we know that $x+30=y$
Since the interior angle of a hexagon is $120^\circ$ and $m\angle PQO=30^\circ$, we know that $\angle OQL$ is a right angle
The acute angles of a right triangle sum to $90^\circ$, so $x+y=90$
Now we can solve for $x$ with $x+(x+30)=90$, which yields $x=30$
The degree measure of $\angle LOQ$ is $\boxed{30^\circ}$.
$\emph{Approach 2}$: We use the fact that trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid to solve for $x$
Since $\overline{NO}$ and $\overline{ML}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid and the base angles are equal
The interior angles of a trapezoid sum to $360^\circ$, so we have $2z+120+120=360$, which yields $z=60$
Angle $O$ is an interior angle of a hexagon that measure $120^\circ$, so $z+x+30=120$
We found that $z=60$, so $x=30$
The degree measure of $\angle LOQ$ is $\boxed{30^\circ}$.

The line $y=b-x$ intersects the $x$-axis at the point where $0 = b-x$, or $x=b$
So, we seek the $x$-coordinate of point $Q$.
Since the $y$-axis is parallel to the line $x = 4$, we see that $\angle QSR = \angle QPO$
Also $QOP = QRS = 90$
Thus $\triangle QOP \sim \triangle QRS$, so $\frac{[QRS]}{[QOP]} =\left(\frac{QR}{QO}\right)^2$, which means we have $\left(\frac{QR}{QO}\right)^2=\frac{9}{25}$, so $\frac{QR}{QO} = \frac35$
Since $QR + QO= 4$, we have $\frac35QO + QO = 4$, and $QO =4\cdot \frac58 = \frac52$
Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of $Q$ is $\frac52 = \boxed{2.5}$.
We know that, for a triangle, area = 1/2(base)(height), which equals 30 in this problem
We also know that the height of the triangle is 4 if we use the horizontal leg on the x-axis as the base
Now we can plug this information into the equation to find the length of the base that runs along the x-axis
The equation is $(1/2)(b)(4) = 30$, so $b = 30/2 = 15$
Since the 3rd vertex is on the x-axis we know that it extends straight left 15 units from the vertex at (0, 0), bringing us to the point $\boxed{(-15, 0)}$.
If $D$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, then $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ would all have equal areas (to see this, remember that the medians of a triangle divide the triangle into 6 equal areas)
There is only one point with this property (if we move around $D$, the area of one of the small triangles will increase and will no longer be $1/3$ of the total area)
So $D$ must be the centroid of triangle $ABC$
The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the centroid are found by averaging the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of the vertices, so $(m,n) = \left( \frac{5+3+6}{3}, \frac{8+(-2)+1}{3} \right) = \left( \frac{14}{3}, \frac{7}{3} \right)$, and $10m + n = 10 \left(\frac{14}{3}\right) + \frac{7}{3} = \boxed{49}$.
We start with a diagram:

We seek $DE$, and we have $EF$ and $\angle D$
We can relate these three with the tangent function: \[\tan D = \frac{EF}{DE},\]so  \[DE = \frac{EF}{\tan D} = \frac{9}{\tan D} \approx \boxed{19.3}.\]

Half of the region described is formed by removing an isosceles right triangle of leg length 2 from a quarter of one of the circles
Because the quarter-circle has area $(1/4)\pi(2)^2=\pi$ and the triangle has area $(1/2)(2)^2=2$, the area of the region is $2(\pi-2)$, or $\boxed{2\pi-4}$.
The number of degrees in a hexagon is $(6-2) \cdot 180=720$ degrees
Setting the degree of the smallest angle to be $x$, and the increment to be $d$, we get that the sum of all of the degrees is $x+x+d+x+2d+x+3d+x+4d+x+5d=6x+15d=720$
We want $15d$ to be even so that adding it to an even number $6x$ would produce an even number $720$
Therefore, $d$ must be even
The largest angle we can have must be less than $150$, so we try even values for $d$ until we get an angle that's greater or equal to $150$
Similarly, we can conclude that $x$ must be a multiple of 5.
The largest angle is $x + 5d.$  We notice that, if we divide both sides of $6x + 15d = 720$ by 3, we get $2x + 5d = 240.$  For $x + 5d < 150,$ we must have $x > 90.$  The largest value of $d$ occurs when $x = 95$ and $5d = 240 - 2x = 240 - 2 \cdot 95 = 240 - 190 = 50,$ or $d = 10.$
Therefore, there are $\boxed{5}$ values for $d$: $2,4,6,8,$ and $10$.
The area of this equilateral triangle is $\frac{4^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}$, and the perimeter is $3 \cdot 4 = 12$
Thus, the ratio of area to perimeter is $\frac{\frac{4^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}}{12}=\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.

For each point on the unit circle with $y$-coordinate equal to $-0.73$, there is a corresponding angle whose sine is $-0.73$
There are two such points; these are the intersections of the unit circle and the line $y=-0.73$, shown in red above
Therefore, there are $\boxed{2}$ values of $x$ with $0^\circ \le x < 360^\circ$ such that $\sin x = -0.73$.
The volume of the cone is $\frac13\cdot4\pi\cdot8=\frac{32}{3}\pi$ cubic inches, and the volume of the hemisphere is $\frac23\cdot8\pi=\frac{16}{3}\pi$
The sum is \[
\left(\frac{16}{3}+\frac{32}{3}\right)\pi=\boxed{16\pi}.
The sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\circ$ as long as we take only one exterior angle per vertex
The polygon is regular, so all of the exterior angles have the same degree measure of $15$ degrees
If the polygon has $n$ sides, then the sum of the exterior angles is $15n=360$
So $n=24$ and the polygon has $\boxed{24}$ sides.
Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we calculate that the other leg of the original right triangle must be $$\sqrt{29^2 - 21^2} = \sqrt{841 - 441} = \sqrt{400} = 20$$ inches
Since 87 is 3 times 29, the length of the shortest side of the second triangle must be $3 \times 20 = \boxed{60\text{ inches}}$.
Each side of the square has length $27$
Each trisected segment therefore has length $9$
We can form the octagon by taking away four triangles, each of which has area $\frac{(9)(9)}{2}$, for a total of $(2)(9)(9) = 162$
The total area of the square is $27^2=729$, so the area of the octagon is $729-162=\boxed{567}$.

[/asy] The triangle is equilateral, since the three sides are equal radii
The common chord is twice an altitude of the triangle
The area of the triangle is $\frac{10^2\sqrt3}{4}=25\sqrt3$ sq cm, so the altitude (length $h$ cm) has $\frac{10h}{2}=25\sqrt{3}$ or $h=5\sqrt3$
The chord is twice this or $\boxed{10\sqrt3}$ cm.
The snow on Khalil's sidewalk is in the shape of a rectangular prism whose dimensions are 20 feet by 2 feet by $\frac{1}{2}$ feet
The volume of such a rectangular prism is $(20\text{ ft.})(2\text{ ft.})\left(\frac{1}{2}\text{ ft.}\right)=\boxed{20}$ cubic feet.

The shaded area is the area of $\triangle CDE$
To find this area, we examine pairs of similar triangles to find desired side lengths.
First, we have $\triangle EOA \sim \triangle COB$, so we have \[\frac{EA}{CB}=\frac{OA}{OB}=\frac{3}{3+9}=\frac{1}{4},\] and since we know $CB=9$, we can find that $EA=9/4$
This means that $DE=9-9/4=27/4$.
Since we know $DE$ and $DC$, we can now find the area of triangle $CDE$
The desired area is $\frac{27/4 \cdot 9}{2}=\frac{243}{8}=30.375$
This value, rounded to the nearest integer as requested, is $\boxed{30}$.
The slant height of the cone is equal to the radius of the sector, or $10$
The circumference of the base of the cone is equal to the length of the sector's arc, or $\frac{252^\circ}{360^\circ}(20\pi) = 14\pi$
The radius of a circle with circumference $14\pi$ is $7$
Hence the answer is $\boxed{C}$.
We use similar triangles: $\triangle BPH \sim \triangle APC$ since they are both right triangles and the angles at $A$ and $B$ are each complementary to $\angle C$, and thus congruent
Similarly, $\triangle AQH \sim \triangle BQC$
We know that $HP=5$ and $HQ=2$, so we have the ratios \[ \frac{BP}{5} = \frac{AH+5}{PC}\]and  \[ \frac{AQ}{2} = \frac{BH+2}{QC}
\]Cross-multiplying and then subtracting the second equality from the first yields \[ (BP)(PC) - (AQ)(QC) = 5(AH)+25 - 2(BH) - 4
\]But $\triangle BPH \sim \triangle AQH$, so $BH/5 = AH/2$, so $5(AH)-2(BH)=0.$ Hence our desired answer is simply $25-4=\boxed{21}$.
A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, so a hemisphere with radius $r$ has volume $\frac{2}{3}\pi r^3$
The large hemisphere-shaped bowl has volume $\frac{2}{3}\pi(1^3) = \frac{2}{3}\pi$ cubic feet.
Let each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds have radius $r$
Their total volume, in terms of $r$, is $27\cdot\frac{2}{3}\pi r^3$ cubic feet, so we have \[27\cdot\frac{2}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{2}{3}\pi.\]Dividing both sides by $\frac{2}{3}\pi$ yields $27r^3 =1$, so $r=\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{27}}=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.
The circle with center $C$ is the incircle of $\triangle PQR$
So, any segment from a vertex of the triangle to $C$ is an angle bisector.
The sum of the measures of the internal angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$, so
\begin{align*}
\angle QRP &= 180^\circ - \angle PQR - \angle QPR \\
&= 180^\circ - 63^\circ - 59^\circ\\
&= 58^\circ.
\end{align*}Since $\overline{RC}$ bisects $\angle QRP$, we have $\angle QRC = \frac{58^\circ}{2} = \boxed{29^\circ}$.
By the Pythagorean Theorem, \begin{align*}
YZ^2 &= YX^2 + XZ^2 \\
&= 60^2+80^2 \\
&= 3600+6400 \\
&=10000,
\end{align*} so $YZ=100.$
(We could also have found $YZ$ without using the Pythagorean Theorem by noticing that $\triangle XYZ$ is a right-angled triangle with its right-angle at $X$ and $XY=60=3\cdot 20$ and $XZ=80=4\cdot 20.$ This means that $\triangle XYZ$ is similar to a 3-4-5 triangle, and so $YZ=5\cdot 20=100.$)
Since $\triangle YXZ$ is right-angled at $X,$ its area is $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot 60\cdot 80=2400.$$ Since $XW$ is perpendicular to $YZ,$ then the area of $\triangle YXZ$ is also equal to $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot 100\cdot XW=50XW.$$ Therefore, $50XW=2400,$ so $XW=48.$ By the Pythagorean Theorem, \begin{align*}
WZ^2 &= 80^2 - 48^2 \\
&= 6400 - 2304 \\
&= 4096.
\end{align*} Thus, $WZ = \sqrt{4096}=\boxed{64}.$
An alternative solution comes by noticing that $\triangle XZW$ and $\triangle YZX$ are similar
Therefore \[\frac{WZ}{XZ}=\frac{XZ}{YZ}\] or \[\frac{WZ}{80}=\frac{80}{100}=\frac45.\] This tells us that  \[WZ=\frac45\cdot80=\boxed{64}.\]
Each of the four shaded triangles in the diagram below has area $\frac{1}{2}(1)(3)=\frac{3}{2}$ square units, and the shaded triangles along with the hexagon form a rectangular region whose area is $6\cdot4=24$ square units
Therefore, the area of the hexagon is $24-4\cdot \frac{3}{2}=\boxed{18}$ square units.

The triangular faces are isosceles triangles
We drop an altitude from the apex to the base, and, since the triangle is isosceles, it will also be a median
So it forms a right triangle with hypotenuse $5$ and one leg $3$, and thus the other leg, the altitude, is $4$
The area of the triangle is then $\frac{4(6)}{2}=12$
Since there are $4$ triangular faces, the total area is $4(12)=\boxed{48}$.
The side length of the square is equal to twice the diameter of one of the circles, so the area of the square is $(20\text{ in})(20\text{ in})=\boxed{400}$ square inches.
Join the centres $A,$ $B,$ and $C$ of the three circles
The lines $AB,$ $BC,$ and $CA$ will pass through the points where the circles touch, so will each have length $10\text{ cm}$ (that is, twice the radius of one of the circles).
We can break the height of the pile into three pieces: the distance from the bottom of the pile to the line $BC,$ the height of the equilateral triangle $ABC,$ and the distance $A$ to the top of the pile.

Triangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \frac{1}{2}$ and $DP = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$, so $\sin 60^\circ = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.
Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be the circumferences of the smaller and larger circle, respectively
The length of the $45^\circ$ arc on the smaller circle is $\left(\frac{45^\circ}{360^\circ}\right)C_1$, and the length of the $36^\circ$ arc on the larger circle is $\left(\frac{36^\circ}{360^\circ}\right)C_2$
Setting these two lengths equal we find \[
\frac{C_1}{C_2}=\frac{36}{45}=\frac{4}{5}.
\]The ratio of the areas of the two circles is the square of the ratio of their circumferences: \[
\frac{\pi r_1^2}{\pi r_2^2}=\left(\frac{r_1}{r_2}\right)^2=\left(\frac{2\pi r_1}{2\pi r_2}\right)^2=\left(\frac{C_1}{C_2}\right)^2=\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2=\boxed{\frac{16}{25}}.
Let $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $225^\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.

Triangle $POD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, so $DO = DP = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$, so $\sin 225^\circ = \boxed{-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}$.
Both angles $\angle BAD$ and $\angle CBE$ subtend arc $BE$, so $\angle CBE = \angle BAE = 43^\circ$
Triangle $BCE$ is isosceles with $BC = CE$, since these are tangent from the same point to the same circle, so $\angle CEB = \angle CBE = 43^\circ$.
Finally, $\angle AEB = 90^\circ$ since $AB$ is a diameter, so $\angle BED = 90^\circ$
Therefore, $\angle CED = \angle BED - \angle BEC = 90^\circ - 43^\circ = \boxed{47^\circ}$.
We start by finding the volume of the bucket and the volume of the barrel
Let $r$ be ten inches
The bucket is half of a sphere of radius $r$, so the volume it can hold is \[ \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^3
\]On the other hand, the barrel is a cylinder of radius $r$ and height $15 \text{ in} = \frac{3}{2} r$, so its volume is \[ \pi r^2 \cdot \text{height} = \frac{3}{2} \pi r^3
\]Therefore the ratio of the volume of the barrel to the volume of the bucket is \[ \frac{(3/2) \pi r^3}{(2/3) \pi r^3} = \frac{9}{4}
= 2 + \frac{1}{4}
\]Thus two buckets will not suffice to fill the barrel, but three will, so Brad needs $\boxed{3}$ trips to the well.
First, we note that the radius of the inscribed circle is 2 cm (since $\pi r^2 = 4\pi$ implies that $r=2$, given that $r$ is nonnegative).
Let $X$ be the midpoint of side $BC$
Thus segment $OX$ is a radius of the inscribed circle: [asy]

[/asy] Then $COX$ is a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle, so the sides $OX$, $CX$, and $CO$ are in the ratio $1:\sqrt3:2$
Since $OX=2$, we have $CX=2\sqrt 3$.
Triangle $ACX$ is also a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle, so the sides $CX$, $AX$, and $AC$ are in the ratio $1:\sqrt3:2$
Thus, $AX=(2\sqrt3)(\sqrt 3)=6$.
Triangle $ABC$ has base $BC = 2(XC) = 4\sqrt 3$ and corresponding height $AX = 6$, so its area is $\frac{1}{2}(4\sqrt 3)(6) = \boxed{12\sqrt 3}$.

[/asy] Here, $AB$ is the telephone pole and $C$ is the point in the ground where the cable $BC$ is anchored
The key is to recognize that $ABC$ is a right triangle since the telephone pole is upright
Meanwhile, Leah stands at $D$ and touches the cable at $E,$ so $DEC$ is another right triangle
Not only that, but we see that $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEC$ thanks to AA similarity.
From the problem, We have that $DE = 1.5\text{m},$ $AC = 3\text{m},$ and $AD = 2.5\text{m}.$ Therefore, $DC = AC - AD = 0.5\text{m}.$ We desire $AB.$ From $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEC,$ we get:
\begin{align*}
\frac{AB}{AC} &= \frac{DE}{DC} \\
\frac{AB}{3\text{m}} &= \frac{1.5\text{m}}{0.5\text{m}} = 3 \\
AB &= 3 \cdot 3\text{m} = \boxed{9}\text{ meters}.
\end{align*}
Since $\cos Q = 0.4$ and $\cos Q = \frac{QP}{QR}=\frac{12}{QR}$, we have $\frac{12}{QR} = 0.4$, so $QR = \frac{12}{0.4} = \boxed{30}$.
The cylinder's original volume is $\pi r^2h$
The new height is $2h$ and the new radius is $r+\frac{200}{100}r=3r$
That means the new volume is $\pi (3r)^2(2h)=\pi r^2h(9)(2)$
The new volume is the original volume multiplied by a factor of $\boxed{18}$.
If the circle has radius 4, its area is $16\pi$
Thus, the area of the rectangle is $32\pi$.
The length of the shorter side of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the circle, so it is 8 centimeters long
This means that the length of the other side is $32\pi/8 = \boxed{4\pi}$.
Since $\angle PQR=\angle PRQ$, then $\triangle PQR$ is an isosceles triangle and $PQ=PR=7$
Therefore, the perimeter of $\triangle PQR$ is $PQ+QR+PR=7+5+7=\boxed{19}$.
Let the height of the cylinder be $h$; we then have \[SA = 2\pi (2^2)+2\pi (2)(h) = 12\pi.\]Solving yields $4\pi h = 4 \pi$ so $h = \boxed{1}$ foot.
Using the Triangle Inequality, we see that the third side must be smaller than the sum of the first two sides, or 13 cm
That means the greatest integer number of centimeters for the third side is $\boxed{12}.$
Rotating $360^\circ$ is the same as doing nothing, so rotating $3825^\circ$ is the same as rotating $3825^\circ - 10\cdot 360^\circ = 225^\circ$
Therefore, we have $\tan 3825^\circ = \tan (3825^\circ - 10\cdot 360^\circ) = \tan 225^\circ$.
Let $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $225^\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.

Triangle $POD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, so $DO = DP = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$, so $\tan 3825^\circ = \tan 225^\circ = \frac{\sin 225^\circ}{\cos 225^\circ} = \frac{-\sqrt{2}/2}{-\sqrt{2}/2} = \boxed{1}$.
Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get

label("$r$", M, W);
[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric
Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral
Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$
Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\frac{r}{2}$
Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\cdot \sqrt{3}=\frac{r}{2} \cdot \sqrt{3}=\frac{r\sqrt{3}}{2}$
Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square
Thus, the square has side length of $\frac{r\sqrt{3}}{\cancel{2}} \cdot \cancel{2}=r\sqrt{3}$.
Calculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$
Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\frac{3r^2}{\pi r^2}=\frac{3\cancel{r^2}}{\pi \cancel{r^2}}=\boxed{\frac{3}{\pi}}$.
To calculate the total surface area of the cylinder, we cut off the two ends to obtain two circles of radius $3.$
draw(circle((3,3),3),black+linewidth(1));
draw((3,3)--(5.1213,3-2.1213),black+linewidth(1));
draw(circle((11,3),3),black+linewidth(1));
draw((11,3)--(13.1213,3-2.1213),black+linewidth(1));
label("3",(3,3)--(5.1213,3-2.1213),SW);
label("3",(11,3)--(13.1213,3-2.1213),SW);
[/asy]
The two ends combined have an area of $$2\pi r^2 = 2 \pi(3^2)=18\pi.$$ Next, we must calculate the lateral surface area
To do this, we make a vertical cut through this area, and unroll the lateral surface
When we do this, we obtain a rectangle with height $10.$ The width of the rectangle (ie
the length of the top edge) is equal to the circumference of one of the ends, since the top edge of this rectangle lay exactly along the circumference of the top end.
draw((0,0)--(15,0)--(15,10)--(0,10)--cycle,black+linewidth(1));
label("10",(0,0)--(0,10),W);
[/asy]
The circumference of one of the ends is $$2\pi r = 2\pi(3)=6\pi,$$ so the width of the rectangle is $6\pi.$ Therefore, the area of this rectangle is $10\times 6\pi = 60\pi.$ So the total surface area of the cylinder is $18\pi + 60\pi = \boxed{78\pi}.$
Consider point $A$ at the center of the diagram
Drawing in lines as shown below divides the region into 3 parts with equal areas
Because the full circle around point $A$ is divided into 3 angles of equal measure, each of these angles is 120 degrees in measure.

size(150);
pair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;
O=(0,0);
A=(-4.619,0);
B=(-2.309,4);
C=(2.309,4);

F=(-2.309,-4);
M=(A+B)/2;

draw(A--O);
draw(B--O);
draw(M--O);
label("$4$", 3M/4, NE);
[/asy] Now, the pieces of area inside the hexagon but outside the circle are identical to the pieces of area the original region was divided into
There were 3 pieces in the original diagram, but there are 6 in the hexagon picture
Thus, the area of the original region is the half the area inside the hexagon but outside the circle.
Because $ABO$ is equilateral, $BMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so $BM=\frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}$
Thus, the side length of the equilateral triangle is $AB=2BM=\frac{8}{\sqrt{3}}$
Now we know the base $AB$ and the height $MO$ so we can find the area of triangle $ABO$ to be $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{8}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 4=\frac{16}{\sqrt{3}}=\frac{16\sqrt{3}}{3}$
The entirety of hexagon $ABCDEF$ can be divided into 6 such triangles, so the area of $ABCDEF$ is $\frac{16\sqrt{3}}{3} \cdot 6 = 32\sqrt{3}$
The area of the circle is $\pi 4^2=16\pi$
Thus, the area inside the heagon but outside the circle is $32\sqrt{3}-16\pi$
Thus, the area of the original region is $\frac{32\sqrt{3}-16\pi}{2}=16\sqrt{3}-8\pi$.
Now we have $a=16$, $b=3$ and $c=-8$
Adding, we get $16+3+(-8)=\boxed{11}$.
Triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ are both right, since their sides form Pythagorean triples
It follows that the desired ratio is $\dfrac{(5\cdot 12)/2}{(8\cdot 15)/2} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{2}}$.
Define points $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$ and $O$ as shown in the figure
Triangles $BCO$ and $BFO$ are right triangles that share a hypotenuse, and $CO=6\text{ cm}=OF$
By the hypotenuse-leg congruency theorem, triangles $BCO$ and $BFO$ are congruent
Therefore, angles $CBO$ and $FBO$ each measure 30 degrees, so angle $BOC$ measures 60 degrees
Since the ratio of the length of the longer leg to the length of the shorter leg in a 30-60-90 triangle is $\sqrt{3}$, $BC=CO\cdot\sqrt{3}=6\sqrt{3}$ cm
Also, angles $DCO$, $CDE$, and $DEO$ each measure 90 degrees, so angle $EOC$ measures 90 degrees as well and quadrilateral $CDEO$ is a rectangle
Therefore, $CD=OE=6$ cm
Summing $BC$ and $CD$, we have $BD=6+6\sqrt{3}$
Because triangle $ABD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, we can double $BD$ to find $\boxed{AB=12+12\sqrt{3}}$ centimeters.

Since $\sin E = 1$, we have $\angle E = 90^\circ$, so our triangle is as shown below:

Since $\sin D = \frac{5}{13}$, we have $\frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{5}{13}$, so $\cos F = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{5}{13}$
Since $\sin^2 F + \cos^2 F = 1$, and $\angle F$ is acute (so $\sin F$ is positive), we have \[\sin F =\sqrt{1 - \cos^2 F} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{25}{169}} = \sqrt{\frac{144}{169}} = \boxed{\frac{12}{13}}.\]We also could have noticed that since $\frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{5}{13}$, we have $EF = 5x$ and $DF = 13x$ for some value of $x$
Then, from the $\{5,12,13\}$ Pythagorean triple, we see that $DE = 12x$, so $\sin F = \frac{DE}{DF} = \frac{12}{13}$.
Since $\triangle ABC$ is equilateral with side length 12 and $X$ and $Y$ are the midpoints of $CA$ and $CB$ respectively, we have $CX=CY=\frac{1}{2}(12)=6$
Since the height of the prism is 16 and $Z$ is the midpoint of $CD$ we have $CZ = \frac{1}{2}(16)=8$.
We have $\angle ACD = \angle BCD = 90^\circ$ since faces $ACDE$ and $BCDF$ are rectangles
Thus, $\triangle XCZ$ and $\triangle YCZ$ are right-angled at $C$
By the Pythagorean Theorem, \[XZ = \sqrt{CX^2 + CZ^2} = \sqrt{6^2+8^2}=\sqrt{100}=10\]and \[YZ = \sqrt{CY^2 + CZ^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{100} = 10.\]Now we look at $\triangle CXY$
We know that $CX = CY = 6$ and that $\angle XCY = 60^\circ$, because $\triangle ABC$ is equilateral
Thus, $\triangle CXY$ is isosceles with $\angle CXY = \angle CYX$
These angles must each be equal to $\frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - \angle XCY) = \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - 60^\circ)=60^\circ$
Thus $\triangle CXY$ is equilateral, so $XY = CX = CY = 6$.
Finally, $XY = 6$ and $XZ = YZ = 10$
The perimeter is then $10+10+6=\boxed{26}$.
$\triangle DBC$ has base $BC$ of length 8 and height $BD$ of length 3; therefore, its area is $\frac{1}{2}\times8\times 3=\boxed{12}$.
By the Power of a Point formula, we know that $AP \cdot BP = CP \cdot DP.$ Substituting, we have $3 \cdot BP = 8 \cdot DP.$ Then, we have $\frac{BP}{DP} = \boxed{\frac{8}{3}}.$
Since $\cos{C}=\frac{9\sqrt{130}}{130}$ and $\cos{C}=\frac{AC}{BC}$, we have $\frac{AC}{BC}=\frac{AC}{\sqrt{130}}=\frac{9\sqrt{130}}{130}$
This means that $AC=\frac{9\sqrt{130}}{130}\cdot\sqrt{130}=\frac{9\cdot\sqrt{130}\cdot\sqrt{130}}{130}=\boxed{9}$.
Let $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{DC}$ be parallel diameters of the bottom and top bases, respectively
A great circle of the sphere is tangent to all four sides of trapezoid $ABCD$
Let $E,F$, and $G$ be the points of tangency on $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CD}$, respectively
Then \[
FB= EB= 18 \quad\text{and}\quad FC= GC= 2,
\]so $BC=20$
If $H$ is on $\overline{AB}$ such that $\angle CHB$ is a right angle, then $HB= 18-2=16.$ Thus \[
CH=\sqrt{20^{2}-16^{2}}=12,
\]and the radius of the sphere is $(1/2)(12)=\boxed{6}$.

Let the dimensions of $P$ be $x$, $y$, and $z$
The sum of the lengths of the edges of $P$ is $4(x+y+z)$, and the surface area of $P$ is $2xy+2yz+2xz$, so \[
x+y+z=28 \quad\text{and}\quad 2xy+2yz+2xz=384.
\] Each internal diagonal of $P$ is a diameter of the sphere, so \begin{align*}
(2r)^2&=(x^2+y^2+z^2)\\
&=(x+y+z)^2-(2xy+2xz+2yz) \\
&= 28^2-384\\& = 400.
\end{align*} So $2r = 20$ and  $r=\boxed{10}$.
Note: There are infinitely many positive solutions of the system $x+y+z=28$, $2xy+2yz+2xz=384$, so there are infinitely many non-congruent boxes meeting the given conditions, but each can be inscribed in a sphere of radius 10.
Since opposite sides of a parallelogram have the same length, we have the equations $$AB=CD\qquad\Rightarrow \qquad38=2x+4\qquad\Rightarrow \qquad x=17$$and $$BC=AD\qquad\Rightarrow \qquad3y^3=24\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad y=2.$$The product of $x$ and $y$ is then $17\cdot2=\boxed{34}$.
Since arc $CD$ is $60^\circ$, $\angle CAD = 60^\circ/2 = 30^\circ$
Since triangle $AOC$ is isosceles with $AO = CO$, $\angle OCA = \angle OAC = 30^\circ$.

Since $\angle ABO = 60^\circ$, and this angle is external to triangle $BCO$, $\angle BOC = \angle ABO - \angle BCO = 60^\circ - 30^\circ = 30^\circ$
Hence, triangle $BCO$ is isosceles, and $BC = BO = \boxed{5}$.

Because of symmetry, these lines split the octagon into 16 congruent regions
Quadrilateral $ABMO$ is made up of three of these regions and pentagon $EDCMO$ is made up of five of these regions
Hence, $[ABMO]/[EDCMO] = \boxed{\frac{3}{5}}$.
Using the Triangle Inequality, we see that $n > 4$ and $n < 14,$ so $n$ can be any integer from $5$ to $13,$ inclusive
The sum can be calculated in several ways, but regardless, $5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 = \boxed{81}.$
The diameter of the large circle is $6+4=10$, so its radius is 5
Hence, the area of the shaded region is $$
\pi(5^2)-\pi(3^2)-\pi(2^2)=\pi(25-9-4)=\boxed{12\pi}.
Since the bases of the trapezoid are $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$, these two line segments must be parallel
Now, since $\overline{AC}$ intersects these two parallel lines, $\angle DCE$ and $\angle BAE$ are alternate interior angles and therefore must be congruent
Similarly, $\overline{DB}$ intersects the bases, so $\angle CDE$ and $\angle ABE$ are congruent
We have two pairs of congruent angles, so $\triangle DCE \sim \triangle BAE$ by the Angle-Angle Similarity Theorem.
Sides of similar triangles are proportional, so since the lengths of sides $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ are related in a $2:1$ proportion, we also have that $EA/EC=2/1$, so the length of $\overline{EC}$ must be $1/3$ that of $\overline{AC}$
Since $\overline{AC}$ has length $11$, $\overline{EC}$ must have length $\dfrac{1}{3} \cdot 11 = \boxed{\dfrac{11}{3}}$.
Let the hemisphere's radius be $r$
The hemisphere's base is a circle with radius $r$; thus, we have $\pi r^2 = 100\pi$
Taking the positive solution for $r$ yields $r = 10$
The surface area of the curved part of the hemisphere is half the surface area of a sphere with radius 10, which is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 4\pi (10^2) = 200\pi$
The total surface area of the hemisphere is the sum of this curved surface area and the base area, which is $200\pi+100\pi=\boxed{300\pi}$.
We can see that $\angle AOC = 360^\circ - (110^\circ + 100^\circ) = 150^\circ.$ Now, $\triangle AOC$ and $\triangle AOB$ are both isosceles triangles
That means that $\angle OAC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (180^\circ - 150^\circ) = 15^\circ$ and $\angle OAB = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (180^\circ - 110^\circ) = 35^\circ.$  Therefore, our answer is $\angle BAC = \angle OAB + \angle OAC = 15^\circ + 35^\circ = \boxed{50^\circ}.$

Therefore \[\angle YZX=180^\circ-50^\circ - 70^\circ=\boxed{60^\circ}.\]
Because triangles $D$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$ and $\overline{AE}$, $ABEC$ must be a parallelogram, so $AB=CE=11$
Then because triangle $ABC$ is isosceles, $BC=AB=11$
That means $BD=
\frac{11}{2}$ or $\boxed{5.5}$.
Each of sector $ABD$ and $BDC$ is one-sixth of a full circle of radius $12,$ so each has area one-sixth of the area of a circle of radius $12.$ Therefore, each sector has area $$\frac{1}{6}(\pi(12^2))=\frac{1}{6}(144\pi)=24\pi.$$ Thus, the area of figure $ABCD$ is $2( 24\pi)=\boxed{48\pi}.$
A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $(1/3)\pi r^2 h$; a cylinder with the same radius and height has volume $\pi r^2 h$
Thus we see the volume of the corresponding cone has 1/3 the volume of the cylinder, which is $(1/3)(54\pi = \boxed{18\pi}$ cubic cm.
First we draw $BD$: [asy]

[/asy] First, we see that $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles; therefore $\angle ACB = \angle ABC = \frac{1}{2}\cdot(180^{\circ}-20^\circ) = 80^\circ.$ Likewise, $\angle ACD = \angle ADC = 80^\circ.$ Now, we see that $\angle BCD = \angle ACB + \angle ACD = 160^\circ.$
Then, we see that $\triangle BCD$ is isosceles as well
That means $\angle CBD = \angle BDC = \frac{1}{2}\cdot(180^{\circ}-160^\circ) = \boxed{10^\circ},$ as desired.
Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral
Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides
Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively
To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown
Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\sqrt{3}$
Thus $OE=DB/\sqrt{3}=6$ inches
Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\frac{4}{3}\pi(\text{radius})^3=\frac{4}{3}\pi(\text{6 inches})^3=\boxed{288\pi}$ cubic inches.

The four white quarter circles in each tile have the same area as a whole circle of radius $1/2$, that is, $\pi(1/2)^2 = \pi/4$ square feet
So the area of the shaded portion of each tile is $ 1 - \pi/4$ square feet
Since there are $8\cdot 10 = 80$ tiles in the entire floor, the area of the total shaded region in square feet is \[
80\left(1 - \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \boxed{80 - 20\pi}.
The thicker solid line in the diagram shows the shortest path that one person could travel
The circle is equally divided into six 60-degree arcs, so the short distance is 40 feet, the same as a radius
The dotted line is a diameter that separates the quadrilateral into two 30-60-90 triangles
The longer leg is $(80\sqrt {3})/2$, or $40\sqrt{3}$ feet
Each person travels $40\sqrt{3} + 40 + 40 + 40\sqrt{3} = 80 + 80\sqrt{3}$ feet
After all six people did this, $6(80 + 80\sqrt{3}) = \boxed{480 + 480\sqrt{3}\text{ feet}}$ had been traveled

Let $O = (0,0)$, and let $A$ and $B$ denote the points where $y=6$ intersects $y=x$ and $y=-x,$ respectively
The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(6, 6)$ and $(-6, 6),$ respectively, so $AB = 6 - (-6) = 12.$ Also, the length of the altitude from $O$ to $AB$ is $6.$ Thus the area of $\triangle OAB$ is\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 \cdot 6 = \boxed{36}.\]
Since $DE \parallel AB,$ we know that $\angle CDE = \angle CAB$ and $\angle CED = \angle CBA.$ Therefore, by AA similarity, we have $\triangle ABC \sim DEC.$ Then, we find: \begin{align*}

Thus, the snowballs with radius 2, 3, and 5 inches have volumes $\frac{4}{3}\pi(2^3)$, $\frac{4}{3}\pi(3^3)$, and $\frac{4}{3}\pi(5^3)$ cubic inches respectively
The total volume of snow used is thus  \begin{align*}
\frac{4}{3}\pi(2^3)+\frac{4}{3}\pi(3^3)+\frac{4}{3}\pi(5^3)&=\frac{4}{3}\pi(2^3+3^3+5^3)\\
&=\frac{4}{3}\pi(8+27+125)\\
&=\boxed{\frac{640}{3}\pi}.\end{align*}
We may consider the diameter of circle $C$ as the base of the inscribed triangle; its length is $12\text{ cm}$
Then the corresponding height extends from some point on the diameter to some point on the circle $C$
The greatest possible height is a radius of $C$, achieved when the triangle is right isosceles: [asy]
unitsize(8);
draw(Circle((0,0),6));
draw(((-6,0)--(6,0)));
label("$12$",(0,0),S);

draw(((-6,0)--(0,6)));
draw(((0,6)--(6,0)));
draw(((0,0)--(0,6)),dashed);
label("$6$",(0,2.5),E);
[/asy] In this case, the height is $6\text{ cm}$, so the area of the triangle is $$\frac 12\cdot 12\cdot 6 = \boxed{36}\text{ square centimeters}.$$
Draw a 4 by 8 rectangle with the vertices at $(4, 4), (12, 4), (12, 0)$ and $(4, 0)$
The area of that box is $4 \times 8 = 32$ square units
From that we can subtract the area of the sectors of the 2 circles that are binding our shaded region
The area of each sector is $(1/4)4^2\pi = 4\pi$; therefore, we need to subtract $2(4\pi) = 8\pi$
This gives us $\boxed{32 - 8\pi}$ square units.
Notice how two of the points, $(4,-1)$ and $(4,5)$, lie on the same line parallel through the $y$-axis with $x$-intercept $(4,0)$
Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$
The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$
The area is thus $\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\boxed{18}$.
First let's compute the volume of the container
The container measures $10\times10\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\cdot10\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed
Since the container is only half full, there are $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it
Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$
This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\cdot2^3=10\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed
This means that there are $1000-580=\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice.
Let $O$ denote the origin, $P$ the center of the circle, and $r$ the radius
A radius from the center to the point of tangency with the line $y = x$ forms a right triangle with hypotenuse $\overline{OP}$
This  right  triangle is isosceles since the line $y=x$ forms a $45^\circ$ angle with the $y$-axis
So \[r\sqrt{2}=r+6\]and \[r=\frac{6}{\sqrt{2}-1}=\boxed{6\sqrt{2}+6}.\][asy]

Since $AB \parallel YZ,$ we know that $\angle A = \angle Z$ and $\angle B = \angle Y.$ That works out nicely, since that means $\triangle ABQ \sim ZYQ.$ If $BQ = 12$ and $QY = 24,$ that means the ratio of sides in $ABQ$ to $ZYQ$ is $1:2.$
Since $AZ = 42 = AQ + QZ$ and $AQ = \dfrac{QZ}{2},$ that means $\dfrac{3 \cdot QZ}{2} = 42$ and thus $QZ = \boxed{28}.$
Since $\triangle ADE$ is isosceles, then $\angle AED=\angle EAD=70^\circ$.
Since the angles in $\triangle ADE$ add to $180^\circ$, then $\angle ADE = 180^\circ - 2(70^\circ) = 40^\circ$.
Since $\angle DEC=2(\angle ADE)$, then $\angle DEC = 2(40^\circ)=80^\circ$.
Since $AEB$ is a straight line, then $\angle CEB = 180^\circ - 80^\circ - 70^\circ = 30^\circ$.
Since $\triangle EBC$ is isosceles, then $\angle ECB=\angle EBC$.
Thus, in $\triangle EBC$, $30^\circ + 2(\angle EBC)=180^\circ$ or $2(\angle EBC)=150^\circ$ or $\angle EBC=\boxed{75^\circ}$.
Construct the square $ABCD$ by connecting the centers of the  large circles, as shown, and  consider the isosceles right  $\triangle BAD$.

Since $AB = AD = 2r$ and $BD = 2 + 2r$, we have $2(2r)^2 = (2 + 2r)^2$
1+2r+r^{2}=2r^{2}, \quad \text{and} \quad r^{2}-2r-1=0.
\]Applying the quadratic formula gives $r=\boxed{1+\sqrt{2}}$.
The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse
Therefore, the desired distance is $10/2 = \boxed{5}$.
Let $s_1$ be the side length of the square inscribed in the semicircle of radius $r$
Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle shown in the diagram, we have $(s_1/2)^2+s_1^2=r^2$, which implies $s_1^2=\frac{4}{5}r^2$
Let $s_2$ be the side length of the square inscribed in the circle of radius $r$
Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle shown in the diagram, we have $(s_2/2)^2+(s_2/2)^2=r^2$, which implies $s_2^2=2r^2$
Therefore, the ratio of  the areas of the two squares is $\dfrac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}=\dfrac{\frac{4}{5}r^2}{2r^2}=\boxed{\dfrac{2}{5}}$

We recognize 8, 15, and 17 as a Pythagorean triple
Since the hypotenuse is the longest side of the right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse is the shortest of the altitudes
The other two altitudes are just the legs themselves, therefore $8 + 15 = \boxed{23}.$
From the given diagram, we can draw the following diagram:
draw((-1,0)--(1,0)--(2,-sqrt(3))--(1,-2*sqrt(3))--(-1,-2*sqrt(3))--(-2,-sqrt(3))--cycle);
draw(Circle((0,-sqrt(3)),sqrt(3)));

Notice how we can split the regular hexagon into 6 equilateral triangles
In order to find the area of the hexagon, we can find the area of one of the triangles and then multiply that by 6
We can assign the following dimensions to the triangle:
draw((1,0)--(-1,0)--(0,-sqrt(3))--cycle);
draw((0,-sqrt(3))--(0,0),linetype("8 8"));
label("$r$",(0,-.9),NE);
label("$\frac{r}{\sqrt{3}}$",(.5,0),NE);
label("$\frac{2r}{\sqrt{3}}$",(.5,-.8),SE);
[/asy]
Now we get that the area of hexagon is $$6\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot r\cdot\frac{2r}{\sqrt{3}}=\frac{6r^2}{\sqrt{3}}.$$ The area of that Fido can reach is $\pi r^2$
Therefore, the fraction of the yard that Fido can reach is  $$\frac{(\pi r^2)}{\left(\frac{6r^2}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}\pi.$$ Thus we get $a=3$ and $b=6$ so $ab=3\cdot6=\boxed{18}.$
We first draw a diagram: [asy]

That means we can come up with two different ways to find the area of $ACE.$ Setting them equal, we have: \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot CE &= \frac{1}{2} \cdot CD \cdot AE \\
AB \cdot CE &= CD \cdot AE \\
4 \cdot CE &= 8 \cdot 5 \\
CE &= \boxed{10}.

Since the square and the equilateral triangle share a side, all sides of the square are the same length as all sides of the equilateral triangle
Specifically, we have $CD=CB$, and so $\triangle BCD$ is isosceles with equal angles at $B$ and $D$
Let $x$ denote the number of degrees in the measure of each of these two angles (that is, $x^\circ=m\angle CDB=m\angle CBD$).
Angle $\angle BCD$ is equal to $90^\circ+60^\circ = 150^\circ$ (since a square and an equilateral triangle have interior angles of $90^\circ$ and $60^\circ$, respectively)
Since the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$, we have $$x + x + 150 = 180,$$ giving $x=\boxed{15}$.
First note that since points $B$ and  $C$  trisect $\overline{AD}$, and points $G$ and  $F$ trisect $\overline{HE}$, we have $HG = GF = FE = AB = BC = CD = 1$
Also,  $\overline{HG}$ is parallel to $\overline{CD}$ and $HG = CD$, so $CDGH$ is a parallelogram
Similarly,  $\overline{AB}$ is parallel to $\overline{FE}$ and $AB = FE$, so $ABEF$ is a parallelogram
As a consequence,  $WXYZ$ is a parallelogram, and since $HG = CD = AB = FE$, it  is a rhombus.

Since $AH = AC = 2$, the rectangle $ACFH$ is a square of side length 2
Its diagonals $\overline{AF}$ and $\overline{CH}$ have length $2\sqrt{2}$ and form a right angle at $X$
As a consequence, $WXYZ$ is a square
In isosceles $\triangle HXF$ we have $HX = XF = \sqrt{2}$
In addition, $HG = \frac{1}{2}HF$
So $XW = \frac{1}{2}XF = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2}$, and the square $WXYZ$ has area $XW^2 = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
Form a triangle whose first vertex is the center of the circle and whose other two vertices are the midpoint and one of the endpoints of a side of the larger hexagon, as shown in the diagram
Since each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees, this triangle is a 30-60-90 right triangle
Let $r$ be the radius of the circle
The length of the longer leg of the triangle is $r$, so the length of the shorter leg is $r/\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the hypotenuse is $2r/\sqrt{3}$
Since for the smaller hexagon the length of the segment connecting a vertex to the center is $r$, the dimensions of the larger hexagon are $2/\sqrt{3}$ times larger than the dimensions of the smaller hexagon
Therefore, the area of the larger triangle is $(2/\sqrt{3})^2=\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}$ times greater than the area of the smaller triangle.

Point $G$ is the centroid of $\triangle DEF$, so $DG:GP = EG:GQ = 2:1$
Therefore, $DG = \frac23(DP) = 12$ and $EG = \frac23(EQ) =16$, so applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $\triangle EGD$ gives us $DE = \sqrt{EG^2 + GD^2} = \boxed{20}$.
Since $\sin N = \frac{2}{3}$ and $\sin N = \frac{LM}{LN}=\frac{16}{LN}$, we have $\frac{16}{LN} = \frac{2}{3}$, so $LN = \frac{16}{\frac{2}{3}} = \boxed{24}$.
Let $D$ and $F$ denote the centers of the circles
Let $C$ and $B$ be the points where the $x$-axis and $y$-axis intersect the tangent line, respectively
Let $E$ and $G$ denote the points of tangency as shown
We know that $AD=DE=2$, $DF=3$, and $FG=1$
Let $FC=u$ and $AB=y$
Triangles $FGC$ and $DEC$ are similar, so $${\frac u1} = \frac{u+3}{2},$$ which yields $u=3$
Hence, $GC = \sqrt{8}$
Also, triangles $BAC$ and  $FGC$ are similar, which yields $$\frac y1={BA\over FG}={AC\over GC}=\frac {8}{\sqrt{8}}=\sqrt{8}
=\boxed{2\sqrt{2}}.$$ [asy]

First consider the points in the six parallelepipeds projecting 1 unit outward from the original parallelepiped
Two of these six parallelepipeds are 1 by 3 by 4, two are 1 by 3 by 5, and two are 1 by 4 by 5
The sum of their volumes is $2(1\cdot3\cdot4+1\cdot3\cdot5+1\cdot4\cdot5)=94$
Next consider the points in the twelve quarter-cylinders of radius 1 whose heights are the edges of the original parallelepiped
The sum of their volumes is $4\cdot{1\over4}\pi\cdot1^2(3+4+5)=12\pi$
Finally, consider the points in the eight octants of a sphere of radius 1 at the eight vertices of the original parallelepiped
The sum of their volumes is $8\cdot{1\over8}\cdot{4\over3}\pi\cdot1^3={{4\pi}\over3}$
Because the volume of the original parallelepiped is $3\cdot4\cdot 5=60$, the requested volume is $60+94+12\pi+4\pi/3=\displaystyle
{{462+40\pi}\over3}$, so $m+n+p=462+40+3=\boxed{505}$.

Therefore, the radius of the larger circle is $10$
Thus, $OR=10$.
Since $QR=3$, then $OQ = OR - QR = 10 - 3 = 7$
Therefore, the radius of the smaller circle is $7$.
Since $S$ is on the positive $y$-axis and is 7 units from the origin, then the coordinates of $S$ are $(0,7)$, which means that $k=\boxed{7}$.

Then $\triangle ACD$ is a right triangle with $AC=1$ and $AD=2$, so $CD =\sqrt{3}$, $\angle CAD = 60^{\circ}$, and the area of $\triangle ACD$ is $\sqrt{3}/2$
The area of 1/4 of the shaded region, as shown in the figure, is the area of sector $BAD$ of the circle centered at $A$, minus the area of $\triangle ACD$, minus the area of 1/4 of the smaller circle
That area is
\frac{2}{3}\pi -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}- \frac{1}{4}\pi = \frac{5}{12}\pi - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},
\]so the area of the entire shaded region is \[
4\left(\frac{5}{12}\pi - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) =
\boxed{\frac{5}{3}\pi - 2\sqrt{3}}.

[/asy] Draw line $AD$, such that we create a larger triangle $\triangle ABD$
$AC$ and $DE$ are medians of this triangle, and since all three medians of a triangle are concurrent, we can extend line $BF$ through $F$ to hit point $Q$ on line $AD$ such that $Q$ is the midpoint of $AD$.
The three medians of a triangle always divide the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area
Knowing this, we have $[\triangle AEF] = [\triangle EFB] = [\triangle FBC] = [\triangle FCD]$
We see that $\triangle ABC$ contains 3 of these smaller triangles
$BEFC$, our desired area, contains 2 of these smaller triangles
Hence \[ [BEFC] = \frac{2}{3} [\triangle ABC] = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}= \boxed{\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}}.\]
The length of the bottom side of the parallelogram is 7 units, and the length of the left side of the parallelogram is $\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5$ units, by the Pythagorean theorem
Since the opposite two sides are congruent to these two, the perimeter of the parallelogram is $5+7+5+7=24$ units
The area of the parallelogram is equal to its base times its height, which is $(7)(4)=28$ square units
Therefore, $p+a=24+28=\boxed{52}$.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$
Since $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, $\overline{AM}$ is an altitude to base $\overline{BC}$
Because $A$ coincides with $O$ when $\triangle ABC$ is folded along $\overline{BC}$, it follows that $AM = MO = \frac{5}{2} + 1
+ 1 = \frac{9}{2} \text{ cm}$
Also, $BC = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3\text{ cm}$, so the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot AM = \frac{1}{2}
\cdot 3 \cdot \frac{9}{2} = \boxed{\frac{27}{4}}\text{ cm}^2$

Let $s$ be the side length of the square, and let $h$ be the length of the altitude of $\triangle ABC$ from $B$
Because $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle WBZ$ are similar, it follows that \[\frac{h-s}{s}=\frac{h}{AC}=\frac{h}{5},\quad \text{so} \quad s=\frac{5h}{5 + h}.
\]Because $h=3\cdot4/5=12/5$, the side length of the square is \[
s = \frac{5(12/5)}{ 5 + 12/5 }=\boxed{\frac{60}{37}}.
Because $\triangle WBZ$ is similar to $\triangle ABC$, we have \[
BZ = \frac{4}{5}s \quad\text{and}\quad CZ = 4 -\frac{4}{5}s.
\]Because $\triangle ZYC$ is similar to $\triangle ABC$, we have \[
\frac{s}{4 - (4/5)s}= \frac{3}{5}.
\]Thus \[
5s = 12 - \frac{12}{5}s\quad\text{and}\quad s = \boxed{\frac{60}{37}}.
Let $x = \angle BAC$
Angles $\angle BAC$, $\angle BCD$, and $\angle CBD$ all intercept the same circular arc, minor arc $BC$ with measure $2 \angle BAC = 2x$
Then $\angle BCD = \angle CBD = x$, so $\angle D = \pi - 2x$.
Since $\angle ABC = \angle ACB$, $\angle ABC = (\pi - x)/2$
Then from the equation $\angle ABC = 2 \angle D$, \[\frac{\pi - x}{2} = 2 (\pi - 2x).\]Solving for $x$, we find $x = 3 \pi/7$, so $k = \boxed{3/7}$.
First, we shall sketch! [asy]
pair A, B, C, D;
A = (0,90);

label("$2x-6$", (A + C)/2, NE);
draw(rightanglemark(A,B,C,90));
[/asy] The first step is to find $x.$ To do this, we simply plug into the Pythagorean Theorem: \begin{align*}
AB^2 + BC^2 &= AC^2 \\
90^2 + x^2 &= (2x - 6)^2 \\
8100 + x^2 &= 4x^2 - 24x + 36 \\
0 &= 3x^2 - 24x - 8064 \\
0 &= x^2 - 8x - 2688 \\
0 &= (x - 56)(x + 48).
\end{align*} The factorization is a little tricky, especially with a large constant term like $-2688,$ but it helps noticing that $2688$ is close to $52^2 = 2704,$ and the $-8x$ term indicates that our factors that multiply to $-2688$ have to be close
That helps narrow our search greatly.
In any case, clearly $x = -48$ is extraneous, so we have that $x = 56.$ Therefore, we have $AC = 106$ and $BC = 56.$ (Did you know that $28:45:53$ is a Pythagorean triple?)
Now, to find the area of $\triangle ADC$ is straightforward
First, clearly the height to base $DC$ is $90,$ so we only really need to find $DC.$ Here we use the Angle Bisector Theorem: \begin{align*}
\frac{BD}{DC} &= \frac{AB}{AC}\\
\frac{BD}{DC} &= \frac{90}{106} = \frac{45}{53}\\
1 + \frac{BD}{DC} &= 1 + \frac{45}{53}\\
\frac{BD + DC}{DC} = \frac{BC}{DC} &= \frac{98}{53}\\
\frac{56}{DC} &= \frac{98}{53}\\
DC &= \frac{53}{98} \cdot 56 = \frac{212}{7}.
\end{align*}
Our area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 90 \cdot \frac{212}{7} = 1362\frac{6}{7} \approx \boxed{1363}.$
The ratio of the areas of the cross sections is equal to $\frac{216\sqrt{3}}{486\sqrt{3}} = \frac 49$
Since the ratio of the area of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides, it follows that the ratio of the corresponding sides of the cross-sections is equal to $\sqrt{\frac 49} = \frac 23$.
Now consider the right triangles formed by the apex of the pyramid, the foot of the altitude from the apex to the cross section, and a vertex of the hexagon
It follows that these two right triangles will be similar, since they share an angle at the apex
The ratio of their legs in the cross-section is $2/3$, so it follows that the heights of the right triangles are in the same ratio
Suppose that the larger cross section is $h$ feet away from the apex; then $h - \frac{2}{3} h = 8$, so $\frac h3 = 8 \Longrightarrow h = \boxed{24}$ feet.
Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the dimensions of the box
It is given that \[140=4a+4b+4c{\qquad \rm and
\qquad}21=\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}\] hence \[35=a+b+c{\qquad (1)\qquad
\rm and\qquad}441=a^2+b^2+c^2{\qquad (2)}.\]
Square both sides of $(1)$ and combine with $(2)$ to obtain \begin{align*}
1225 & = (a+b+c)^2 \\
&= a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca \\
&= 441+2ab+2bc+2ca.
\end{align*}
Thus the surface area of the box is \[ 2ab+2bc+2ca=1225-441=\boxed{784}.\]
Let the radius of the smaller circle be $r$
Then the side length of the smaller square is $2r$
The radius of the larger circle is half the length of the diagonal of the smaller square, so it is $\sqrt{2}r$
Hence the larger square has sides of length $2\sqrt{2}r$
The ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger square is therefore \[
\frac{\pi r^2}{\left(2\sqrt{2}r\right)^2} =\boxed{\frac{\pi}{8}}.

Let the angles be $a$, $a + d$, $a + 2d$, and $a + 3d$, from smallest to largest
Note that the sum of the measures of the smallest and largest angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the second smallest and second largest angles
This means that the sum of the measures of the smallest and largest angles is equal to half of the total degrees in the trapezoid, or $180^\circ$
Since the largest angle measures $120^\circ$, the smallest must measure $180^\circ - 120^\circ = \boxed{60^\circ}$.
The volume of any pyramid is $\frac 13$ the product of the base area and the height
However, determining the height of the purple tetrahedron is somewhat tricky! Instead of doing that, we observe that the total volume of the cube consists of the purple tetrahedron and four other "clear" tetrahedra
Each clear tetrahedron is formed by one of the black vertices of the cube together with its three purple neighbors
The clear tetrahedra are convenient to work with because they have lots of right angles.
Each clear tetrahedron has an isosceles right triangular base of area $\frac 12\cdot 6\cdot 6 = 18$, with corresponding height $6$ (a side of the cube)
Thus, each clear tetrahedron has volume $\frac 13\cdot 18\cdot 6 = 36$.
The cube has volume $6^3 = 216$
The volume of the purple tetrahedron is equal to the volume of the cube minus the volume of the four clear tetrahedra
This is $216 - 4\cdot 36 = \boxed{72}$.
Since $PQ$ is parallel to $SR,$ the height of $\triangle PQS$ (considering $PQ$ as the base) and the height of $\triangle SRQ$ (considering $SR$ as the base) are the same (that is, the vertical distance between $PQ$ and $SR$).
Since $SR$ is twice the length of $PQ$ and the heights are the same, the area of $\triangle SRQ$ is twice the area of $\triangle PQS.$ In other words, the area of $\triangle PQS$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the total area of the trapezoid, or $\frac{1}{3}\times 12 = \boxed{4}.$
Call the center of the inscribed circle $C$, and let $D$ be the point shared by arc $AB$ and the inscribed circle
Let $E$ and $F$ be the points where the inscribed circle is tangent to $OA$ and $OB$ respectively
Since angles $CEO$, $CFO$, and $EOF$ are all right angles, angle $FCE$ is a right angle as well
Therefore, the measure of angle $DCE$ is $(360-90)/2=135$ degrees
By symmetry, angles $ECO$ and $FCO$ are congruent, so each measures 45 degrees
Therefore, angle $DCO$ measures $135+45=180$ degrees, which implies $DC+CO=OD$
Also, $DC=r$, and $CO=r\sqrt{2}$, since triangle $CEO$ is an isosceles right triangle
Since $OD$ is a radius of the circle centered at $O$, we may set $DC+CO=r+r\sqrt{2}$ equal to 3 cm to find \[
r=\frac{3\text{ cm}}{\sqrt{2}+1}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{\sqrt{2}-1}=\boxed{3\sqrt{2}-3}\text{ centimeters}.

draw(rightanglemark(C,D,A,18));
label("8",D,S); label("9",(A+C)/2,W); label("9",(B+C)/2,E);
[/asy] The right triangles are congruent because the original triangle is isosceles; each right triangle has one leg length $8/2=4$ and hypotenuse length 9
The other leg, which is also the height of the original triangle, has length $\sqrt{9^2-4^2}=\sqrt{65}$
Thus, the original triangle has base length 8, height $\sqrt{65}$, and area \[\frac{1}{2}(8)(\sqrt{65})=\boxed{4\sqrt{65}}.\]
Because $\triangle VWX$ is a right triangle, $\tan V = \frac{WX}{VW}$.
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $$WX = \sqrt{VX^2 - WX^2} = \sqrt{13 - 9} = \sqrt{4} = 2.$$Then $\tan V = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
The ratio of the length of the longest sides of the small triangle to the large triangle is $10/25 = 2/5$, which must hold constant for all sides of the two triangles since they are similar
Thus the perimeters of the two triangles are also in the ratio of $2/5$
The small triangle has perimeter $8+8+10=26$, so the large triangle has perimeter $\frac{5}{2}\cdot 26 = \boxed{65}$.

Triangle $POD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, so $DO = DP = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$, so $\sin 315^\circ = \boxed{-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}$.
The Angle Bisector Theorem tells us that  \[\frac{AC}{AX}=\frac{BC}{BX}\]so \[AX=\frac{AC\cdot BX}{BC}=\frac{21\cdot24}{28}=\frac{7\cdot3\cdot6\cdot 4}{7\cdot4}=\boxed{18}.\]
We first observe that by the Pythagorean theorem $\triangle PBC$ must be a right triangle with right angle at $P$, since $PB=3$, $PC=4$, and $BC=5$.
$[\triangle PBC]=\frac{1}{2}(3)(4) = 6=\frac{1}{2}(PH)(5)$
Hence, the altitude $\overline{PH}$ from $P$ to $\overline{BC}$ has length $\frac{12}{5}$
Let $h$ be the length of the altitude from $A$ to $\overline{BC}$
Then $[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2}(h)(5)$, so the area is maximized when $A$ is most high above $\overline {BC}$
Since $AP=2$, maximization occurs when $A$ is directly over $P$, leading to a height of $h=\frac{12}{5}+2=\frac{22}{5}$
In this case, \[[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{22}{5} \right)(5)=\boxed{11}.\]
By similarity, we know that $\frac{10}{x} = \frac{8}{5}$, so therefore $x = \frac{50}{8} = \boxed{6.25}$.
Write the area of pentagon $ABCDE$ as sum the areas of square $ABDE$ and triangle $BCD$
Since square $ABDE$ has area $4^2=16$ square units, triangle $BCD$ has area $40-16=24$ square units
If $h$ is the $y$-coordinate of point $C$, the height of triangle $BCD$ is $h-4$ units and its base is $4$ units
Solving $\frac{1}{2}(4)(h-4)=24$, we find $h=\boxed{16}$.
First, we build a diagram:

We have $\angle AHB = \angle DHE$, and from quadrilateral $CDHE$, we have  \begin{align*}
\angle DHE &= 360^\circ - \angle HEC - \angle ECD - \angle CDH \\
&= 360^\circ - 90^\circ - \angle ACB - 90^\circ\\
&= 180^\circ - \angle ACB.
\end{align*} From triangle $ABC$, we have $180^\circ - \angle ACB = \angle BAC + \angle ABC = 46^\circ + 71^\circ = \boxed{117^\circ}$
Each box has volume $4^3=64$ cubic feet
Thus, three boxes have volume $64\cdot3=\boxed{192}$ cubic feet.
The midpoint of a diameter of a circle is its center
Thus, $M$ is the midpoint of the segment from $(-1,-4)$ to $(-7,6),$ so $M$ has coordinates \[\left(\frac{-1+(-7)}{2},\frac{-4+6}{2} \right)=\boxed{(-4,1)}.\]

Rotating the point $(1,0)$ about the origin by $270^\circ$ counterclockwise gives us the point $(0,-1)$, so $\cos 270^\circ = \boxed{0}$.

Since $\angle ABP=90^{\circ}$, $\triangle ABP$ is a right-angled triangle
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $$BP^2=AP^2-AB^2=20^2-16^2=144$$ and so $BP=12$, since $BP>0$.
Since $\angle QTP=90^{\circ}$, $\triangle QTP$ is a right-angled triangle with $PT=12$
Since $PT=BP=12$, then by the Pythagorean Theorem, $$QT^2=QP^2-PT^2=15^2-12^2 = 81$$ and so $QT=9$, since $QT>0$.
Our final answer is then $\boxed{12,9}$.
Define $E$ and $F$ to be the feet of the perpendiculars drawn to $AB$ from $C$ and $D$ respectively

Also, from the Pythagorean theorem, $CE=DF=\sqrt{10^2-6^2}=8$
Again using the Pythagorean theorem, $AC=\sqrt{CE^2+AE^2}=\sqrt{8^2+15^2}=\boxed{17}$ units.

The smallest such triangle has lengths 1, 2, and 3
However, this triangle doesn't work since the sum of any two side lengths must be greater than the third side length (by the Triangle Inequality)
The next smallest triangle has lengths 2, 3, and 4, which works
Thus, the smallest possible perimeter is $2+3+4=\boxed{9}$ units.
Let the original radius be $r$
The volume of the cylinder with the increased radius is $\pi \cdot (r+6)^2 \cdot 2$
The volume of the cylinder with the increased height is $\pi \cdot r^2 \cdot 8$
Since we are told these two volumes are the same, we have the equation $\pi \cdot (r+6)^2 \cdot 2 = \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot 8$
Simplifying, we have $(r+6)^2=4r^2 \Rightarrow r^2+12r+36=4r^2 \Rightarrow r^2-4r-12=0$
Factoring, we have $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=\boxed{6}$ (it cannot be negative because it is a physical length).

\[\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot 12^2 = 36 \sqrt{3}.\]Thus, the area of the right part of the shaded region is $24\pi - 36\sqrt{3},$ so the area of the entire shaded region is $$2(24\pi-36\sqrt{3})=\boxed{48\pi-72\sqrt{3}}.$$
The circle with center $C$ is the incircle of $\triangle PQR$
So, any segment from a vertex of the triangle to $C$ is an angle bisector.
From $\angle QRC = 30^\circ$, we find that $\angle QRP = 60^\circ$ because $RC$ is an angle bisector.
The sum of the measures of the internal angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$, so
\begin{align*}
\angle QPR &= 180^\circ - \angle PQR - \angle QRP \\
&= 180^\circ - 65^\circ - 60^\circ.
\end{align*}This yields $\angle QPR = \boxed{55^\circ}$.

This means $AP=40$
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $AP^2=1600=AO^2-OP^2$
The area of the shaded region is  \[
AO^2\pi-OP^2\pi=\pi\left(AO^2-OP^2\right)=\boxed{1600\pi}\text{ square units.}
Let $x$ be the number of degrees in $\angle ABC$
Since $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles with $AC=BC$, we have $\angle BAC=\angle ABC$.
So, the three interior angles of $\triangle ABC$ measure $x^\circ$, $x^\circ$, and $40^\circ$
The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$, so we have $$x+x+40 = 180,$$which we can solve to obtain $x=70$
Finally, $\angle CBD$ is supplementary to angle $\angle ABC$, so \begin{align*}
m\angle CBD &= 180^\circ - m\angle ABC \\
&= 180^\circ - 70^\circ \\
&= \boxed{110}^\circ.

[/asy] Since the hexagon is regular, $\angle DXA = 120^\circ$ and $\angle AXY = \angle DXY = 120^\circ / 2 = 60^\circ$
Thus, $\triangle AXY$ and $\triangle DXY$ are congruent $30^\circ - 60^\circ - 90^\circ$ triangles
These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.
Since the side length of the hexagon is 10, we have $AX=XD=10$
It follows that $XY = AX/2 = 5$ and $AY = DY = \sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \sqrt{75} = 5\sqrt{3}$
(Notice that this value is $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $XY$, the short leg
In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\circ - 60^\circ - 90^\circ$ is $1:\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $DA = 2\cdot 5\sqrt{3} = \boxed{10\sqrt{3}}$.
Imagine the square whose diagonal would be PQ
Clearly, that square would be formed of 9 of the shaded squares
The formula for the area of a square from its diagonal is $A = \frac{d^2}{2}$, therefore, the area of that imaginary square is 18
Thus, each smaller shaded square has area 2, making for a total of $\boxed{32\text{ square cm}}$ for the entire shaded area.

[/asy] Divide the quadrilateral into two triangles with the dashed line
We will find the area of these two triangles separately
Since $AB$ is horizontal, the area of triangle $ABC$ is half the product of the length $AB$ multiplied by the length of the vertical altitude from $C$ to line $AB$, or $\frac{1\cdot2006}{2}=1003$
Since $AD$ is vertical, the area of triangle $ACD$ is half the product of the length $AD$ multiplied by the length of the horizontal altitude from $C$ to line $AD$, or $\frac{2\cdot2005}{2}=2005$
The area of the entire quadrilateral is $1003+2005=\boxed{3008}$ square units.
Let $O$ be the center of the circle, and $r$ its radius, and let $X'$ and $Y'$ be the points diametrically opposite $X$ and $Y$, respectively
We have $OX' = OY' = r$, and $\angle X'OY' = 90^\circ$
Since triangles $X'OY'$ and $BAC$ are similar, we see that $AB = AC$
Let $X''$ be the foot of the altitude from $Y'$ to $\overline{AB}$
Since $X''BY'$ is similar to $ABC$, and $X''Y' = r$, we have $X''B = r$
It follows that $AB = 3r$, so $r = 2$.

Let the side length of the cube be $s$
The side length of the cube is equal to diameter of the inscribed sphere, so the radius of the sphere has length $\frac{s}{2}$
Thus, the volume of the sphere is equal to $\frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{\pi s^3}{6}$ and the volume of the cube is equal to $s^3$
Hence the ratio of the sphere's volume to the cube's volume is $\boxed{\frac{\pi}{6}}$.
Let $x$ be the degree measure of $\angle A$
Then the degree measures of angles $B$, $C$,  and $D$ are $x/2$, $x/3$, and $x/4$, respectively
The degree measures of the four angles have a sum of 360, so \[
360 = x+\frac{x}{2}+\frac{x}{3}+\frac{x}{4} =
\frac{25x}{12}.
\]Thus $x=(12\cdot 360)/25 = 172.8\approx \boxed{173}$.
We start by drawing the frustum
Let the top and bottom circles have centers $O_1$ and $O_2$ respectively, and label points $A$ and $B$ on the circumferences as shown such that $O_1$, $O_2$, $A$, and $B$ lie in the same plane.

Because the frustum was cut from a right circular cone, $\angle AO_1O_2$ and $\angle BO_2O_1$ are both right angles
We drop a perpendicular from $A$ to $\overline{O_2B}$ and let the intersection point be $X$
Then $O_1AXO_2$ is a rectangle and \[XB=O_2B-O_1A=6-3=3.\]Pythagorean theorem on right $\triangle AXB$ gives \[AB=\sqrt{AX^2 + BX^2}=\sqrt{4^2+3^2}=5.\]Thus the slant height of the frustum is 5.
Extend $\overline{O_1O_2}$ and $\overline{AB}$ above the frustum, and let them intersect at point $C$
$C$ is the tip of the full cone that the frustum was cut from
To compute the lateral surface area of the frustum, we compute the lateral surface area of the full cone and subtract off the lateral surface area of the smaller cone that was removed.

$\triangle CO_1A$ and $\triangle CO_2B$ are similar, so \[\frac{CO_1}{CO_2} = \frac{CA}{CB}=\frac{O_1A}{O_2B}=\frac{3}{6}.\]Thus $CO_1=4$ and $CA=5$ (and we see the small removed cone has half the height of the full cone)
Also, $CB=10$.
Now we unroll the lateral surface area of the full cone
(The desired frustum lateral area is shown in blue.)

Since $ABCDE$ is a regular pentagon, we know by symmetry that the measures of $\angle CAB$ and $\angle BCA$ are equal
We also know that the sum of the measures of the angles of $\triangle ABC$ equals $180$ degrees
Thus, if we let $x = $ the measure of $\angle CAB$ = the measure of $\angle BCA$, we have that $180 = 108 + x + x \Rightarrow 2x = 72 \Rightarrow x = 36$
The measure of angle $CAB$ is $\boxed{36}$ degrees.
Since the perimeter of the triangle is 36, then $7+(x+4)+(2x+1)=36$ or $3x+12=36$ or $3x=24$ or $x=8$.
Thus, the lengths of the three sides of the triangle are $7$, $8+4=12$ and $2(8)+1=17$, of which the longest is $\boxed{17}.$
We have that $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, and that $CD = BC/2 = 20 \sqrt{3}/2 = 10 \sqrt{3}$.

Also, triangle $CED$ is a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle, so $DE = CD/\sqrt{3} = 10 \sqrt{3}/\sqrt{3} = \boxed{10}$.
The surface area of a cube equals 6 times the area of each face (since there are 6 faces)
If the cube has a sidelength of $s$, then the surface area equals $6s^2$
We set that equal to 600 and solve for $s$, which must be positive
$$600=6s^2\qquad\Rightarrow 100=s^2\qquad\Rightarrow 10=s$$ The volume of the cube is $s^3=10^3=\boxed{1000}$ cubic units.

Since the smaller circle and the larger circle touch at $A,$ the diameter through $A$ of the smaller circle lies along the diameter through $A$ of the larger circle
(This is because each diameter is perpendicular to the common tangent at the point of contact.)
Since $AO$ is a radius of the larger circle, it is a diameter of the smaller circle.
Since the radius of the larger circle is $6,$ the diameter of the smaller circle is $6,$ so the radius of the smaller circle on the left is $3.$
Similarly, we can draw a radius through $O$ and $B$ and deduce that the radius of the smaller circle on the right is also $3.$ The area of the shaded region equals the area of the larger circle minus the combined area of the two smaller circles
Thus, the area of the shaded region is $$6^2\pi - 3^2\pi - 3^2\pi = 36\pi - 9\pi - 9\pi = \boxed{18\pi}.$$
Since $OA=OB=OC$, triangles $AOB$, $BOC$, and $COA$ are all isosceles
Hence \[
\angle ABC = \angle ABO + \angle OBC =
\frac{180^{\circ}-140^{\circ}}{2}+
\frac{180^{\circ}-120^{\circ}}{2}=\boxed{50^{\circ}}.
Since \[
\angle AOC = 360^{\circ}-140^{\circ}-120^{\circ}=100^{\circ},
\]the Central Angle Theorem implies that \[
\angle ABC = \frac{1}{2}\angle AOC = \boxed{50^{\circ}}.
Since $OY$ is a radius of the circle with centre $O,$ we have $OY=12.$ To find the length of $XY,$ we must find the length of $OX.$
Since $OA=OB,$ we know that $\triangle OAB$ is isosceles.
Since $\angle AOB = 60^\circ,$ we have $$\angle OAB=\frac{1}{2}(180^\circ-60^\circ)=60^\circ.$$ Therefore, $$
\angle AOX = 180^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ
=30^\circ,
$$ so $\triangle OAX$ is a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle.
Since $OA=12,$ we have $AX = \frac{1}{2}OA=6$ and $OX = \sqrt{3}AX=6\sqrt{3}.$ Thus, $$XY=OY-OX = \boxed{12 - 6\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.61.$$
Note that $1.5^2 + 2^2 = 2.5^2,$ so $\triangle PED$ has a right angle at $P.$ (Alternatively, you could note that $(1.5, 2, 2.5)$ is half of the Pythagorean triple $(3,4,5).$) [asy]size(6cm);pair P=(0,0),D=(0,-2),E=(-1.5,0),C=(3,0),A=(0,4),B=extension(A,E,D,C);draw(A--B--C--cycle^^C--E^^A--D);draw(rightanglemark(E,P,D));draw(E--D);dot("$A$",A,N);dot("$B$",B,SW);dot("$C$",C,dir(0));dot("$D$",D,SSE);dot("$E$",E,NW);dot("$P$",P,NE);[/asy] Since the centroid $P$ divides medians $AD$ and $CE$ in the ratio $2 : 1,$ we have $CP = 2 \cdot EP = 2 \cdot 1.5 = 3$ and $AP = 2 \cdot DP = 2 \cdot 2 = 4.$ Then quadrilateral $AEDC$ consists of four right triangles; we can then compute its area as \[[AEDC] = \tfrac12 (4 \cdot 1.5 + 2 \cdot 1.5 + 3 \cdot 2 + 4 \cdot 3) = \boxed{13.5}.\]
Diameters $PQ$ and $RS$ cross at the center of the circle, which we call $O$.
The area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of $\triangle POS$ and $\triangle ROQ$ plus the sum of the areas of sectors $POR$ and $SOQ$.
Each of $\triangle POS$ and $\triangle ROQ$ is right-angled and has its two perpendicular sides of length 4 (the radius of the circle).
Therefore, the area of each of these triangles is $\frac{1}{2}(4)(4)=8$.
Each of sector $POR$ and sector $SOQ$ has area $\frac{1}{4}$ of the total area of the circle, as each has central angle $90^\circ$ (that is, $\angle POR = \angle SOQ = 90^\circ$) and $90^\circ$ is one-quarter of the total central angle.
Therefore, each sector has area $\frac{1}{4}(\pi(4^2))=\frac{1}{4}(16\pi)=4\pi$.
Thus, the total shaded area is $2(8)+2(4\pi)=\boxed{16+8\pi}$.
Let's draw a sketch first

AM^2 &= AB^2 - BM^2\\
AM^2 &= 8^2 - 5^2 = 39\\
AM &= \boxed{\sqrt{39}}
\end{align*}
Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively
The new cylinder has volume \[
\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\pi r^2 h,
\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume
Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.
The volume of a cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ is $(1/3) \pi r^2 h$; the volume of a cylinder with similar dimensions is $\pi r^2 h$
The cone has the same radius as the cylinder and half the height, so it has $1/3$ the volume of half the cylinder and thus has $1/2\cdot 1/3 = 1/6$ the volume of the whole cylinder
Hence the desired ratio is $\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$.
Without loss of generality, assume that our square has vertices at $(0,0)$, $(10,0)$, $(10,10)$, and $(0,10)$ in the coordinate plane, so that the 40 equally spaced points are exactly those points along the perimeter of this square with integral coordinates
We first note that if $P$, $Q$, and $R$ are three of these points which are not collinear, then the centroid of $\triangle PQR$ must lie in the interior of the square, not along one of its sides
And secondly, we recall that the coordinates of the centroid are found by averaging the coordinates of $P$, $Q$, and $R$
Therefore the coordinates of the centroid must be of the form $\left(\frac{m}{3}, \frac{n}{3}\right)$ where $m$ and $n$ are integers with $1\le m,n\le 29$.
To show that every point of the form $\left( \frac{m}{3}, \frac{n}{3} \right)$ can be a centroid, we divide into cases.
If $1 \le m \le 10$ and $1 \le n \le 10$, then we can take the points as $(0,0)$, $(m,0)$, and $(0,n)$.
If $10 \le m \le 19$ and $1 \le n \le 10$, then we can take the points as $(m - 10,0)$, $(10,0)$, and $(0,n)$.
If $20 \le m \le 29$ and $1 \le n \le 10$, then we can take the points as $(m - 20,0)$, $(10,0)$, and $(10,n)$.
If $1 \le m \le 10$ and $11 \le n \le 19$, then we can take the points as $(m,0)$, $(0,n - 10)$, and $(0,10)$.
If $10 \le m \le 19$ and $11 \le n \le 19$, then we can take the points as $(10,0)$, $(0,n - 10)$, and $(m - 10,10)$.
If $20 \le m \le 29$ and $11 \le n \le 19$, then we can take the points as $(m - 20,0)$, $(10,n - 10)$, and $(10,10)$.
If $1 \le m \le 10$ and $20 \le n \le 29$, then we can take the points as $(0,n - 20)$, $(0,10)$, and $(m,10)$.
If $10 \le m \le 19$ and $20 \le n \le 29$, then we can take the points as $(0,n - 20)$, $(m - 10,10)$, and $(10,10)$.
If $20 \le m \le 29$ and $20 \le n \le 29$, then we can take the points as $(m - 20,10)$, $(10,n - 20)$, and $(10,10)$.
Thus, every point of the form $\left( \frac{m}{3}, \frac{n}{3} \right)$ can be a centroid
This means that there are $29^2=\boxed{841}$ positions for the centroid.
The area of the annulus is the difference between the areas of the two circles, which is $\pi b^2 -\pi c^2$
Because the tangent $\overline{XZ}$ is perpendicular to the radius $\overline{OZ}$, $b^2 -
c^2 = a^2$, so the area is $\boxed{\pi a^2}$.
The line $y=\frac x2$ will intersect the two vertical sides of the square, as shown below:
real f(real x)
return x/2;

draw(shift((0,10))*"$a$",(a+2*eps,-a/2)--(a+2*eps,a/2),Arrows);[/asy]
The equation of the right side of the square is $x=a,$ so we have $y= \frac x2 = \frac a2,$ which means that the intersection point with the right side of the square is $\left(a, \frac a2 \right).$ Similarly, the equation of the left side of the square is $x=-a,$ so we have $y= \frac x2 = -\frac a2,$ which means that the intersection point with the left side of the square is $\left(-a, -\frac a2 \right).$ It follows that the sides of each quadrilateral have lengths $\frac a2,$ $2a,$ $\frac{3a}2,$ and $\sqrt{a^2 + (2a)^2} = a\sqrt{5},$ by the Pythagorean theorem
Hence, the perimeter of the quadrilateral is \[\frac a2 + 2a + \frac{3a}2 + a\sqrt{5} = \left(4+\sqrt5\right)a,\]and when this is divided by $a,$ we get $\boxed{4+\sqrt{5}}.$
The two bases of the trapezoids are the segments $AB$ and $CD$, and the height is the perpendicular distance between the bases, which in this case is the difference of the $x$-coordinates: $5 - 1 = 4$
Similarly, the lengths of the bases are the differences of the $y$-coordinates of their two endpoints
Using the formula $A = \frac{1}{2}(b_1+ b_2)h$, the area is $\frac{1}{2}(3+6)(4) = \boxed{18}$ square units.
In triangle $ABF$, the two acute angles are equal since $AB=AF$
Also, the measure of $\angle A$ is $180^\circ(6-2)/6=120^\circ$
Letting $x$ be the measure of $\angle ABF$, we have \[
120^\circ+x+x=180^\circ \implies x=\boxed{30}\text{ degrees}.

Since $JM$ bisects $\angle J$, we know that the measure of $\angle KJM$ is $60/2 = 30$ degrees
Similarly, since $MK$ bisects $\angle K$, we know that the measure of $\angle JKM$ is $30/2 = 15$ degrees
Finally, since the sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle always equals $180$ degrees, we know that the sum of the measures of $\angle JKM$, $\angle KJM$, and $\angle JMK$ equals $180$ degrees
Thus, the measure of $\angle JMK = 180 - 30 - 15 = \boxed{135}$ degrees.
The midpoint of segment $s_1$ can be found using the midpoint formula: $\left(\frac{4-8}2,\frac{1+5}2\right)=(-2,3).$  The midpoint of $s_2$ is the translation of the midpoint of $s_1$ be $2$ units to the right and $3$ units up
Thus its coordinates are $(-2+2,3+3)=\boxed{(0,6)}.$
We can begin by using the circumference to solve for the radius of the circle
If the circumference is $12\pi$, then $2\pi r=12\pi$ which implies $r=6$
Now, we can draw in the radius $TZ$ as shown: [asy]
size(150);
draw(Circle((0,0),13),linewidth(1));
draw((-12,-5)--(-5,-12)--(12,5)--cycle,linewidth(1));

We know that $TX=TZ$, since both are radii of length 6
We are given $\angle TXZ=60^{\circ}$, so $\angle TZX=60^{\circ}$, and triangle $TXZ$ is equilateral
Thus, $TX=TZ=XZ=\boxed{6}$.
The sum of the smaller two sides must exceed the greatest side, so if $x$ is the missing side then $x+33>42\implies x>9$
The smallest integer greater than 9 is 10, so the least perimeter is $10+33+42=\boxed{85}$ units.
There are two diagonals, such as $x$, in each of the six faces for a total of twelve face diagonals
There are also four space diagonals, such as $y$, which are within the cube
This makes a total of $\boxed{16}$.
Let $h$ be the height of the trapezoid
The height of the trapezoid is also a height of $ABC$ and of $ADC$
Specifically, we have $[ABC] = (AB)(h)/2$ and $[ADC] = (CD)(h)/2$, so $[ABC]:[ADC] = AB:CD$
Since we are given that this area ratio equals $7:3$, we know that $AB:CD = 7:3$
Therefore, $AB = 7x$ and $CD = 3x$ for some  value of $x$
Since $AB + CD = 210$ cm, we have $7x+3x=210$, so $10x=210$ and $x=21$
Therefore,  $AB=7 \times 21 = \boxed{147\text{ cm}}$.
In $\triangle PQR$, since $PR=RQ$, then $\angle RPQ=\angle PQR = 48^\circ$.
Since $\angle MPN$ and $\angle RPQ$ are opposite angles, we have $\angle MPN = \angle RPQ=48^\circ$.
In $\triangle PMN$, $PM=PN$, so $\angle PMN = \angle PNM$.
Therefore, $$\angle PMN = \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - \angle MPN) = \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - 48^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}(132^\circ)=\boxed{66^\circ}.$$
The volume of a cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ is \[\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h.\] Therefore, we want $h$ to satisfy \[\frac{1}{3} \pi \cdot 3^2 \cdot h \ge 93,\] or \[h \ge \frac{93}{3 \pi} \approx 9.87.\] Therefore, the height must be $\boxed{10}$ inches.

We "complete" the truncated cone by adding a smaller, similar cone atop the cut, forming a large cone
We don't know the height of the small cone, so call it $x$
Since the small and large cone are similar, we have $x/4=(x+6)/8$; solving yields $x=6$
Hence the small cone has radius 4, height 6, and volume $(1/3)\pi(4^2)(6)=32\pi$ and the large cone has radius 8, height 12, and volume $(1/3)\pi(8^2)(12)=256\pi$
The frustum's volume is the difference of these two volumes, or $256\pi-32\pi=\boxed{224\pi}$ cubic cm.
To start, we can draw in a line from where the altitude meets the base to one of the bottom corners as shown:
size(150);
draw((0,0)--(3,3)--(13,3)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));
draw((0,0)--(6.5,15)--(3,3),linewidth(1));
draw((13,3)--(6.5,15)--(10,0),linewidth(1));
draw((6.5,15)--(6.5,1.5),linewidth(1));
draw((6.5,1.5)--(10,0),linewidth(.7));
[/asy]
The length of this segment will be half the length of the diagonal of the base
The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\sqrt{2}$
Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of
The length of this edge is: $$\sqrt{12^2+(5\sqrt{2})^2}=\sqrt{144+50}=\sqrt{194}\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\approx \boxed{ 96}$$
Since the two horizontal lines are $5-2=3$ units apart, we know that the side of the square is $3$ units long
Therefore, the fourth line must be parallel to $x=1$
If $x=a$ is to the left of $x=1$, its equation is $x=1-3=-2$
If $x=a$ is to the right of $x=1$, then its equation is $x=1+3=4$
Therefore, the two values for $a$ are $4$ and $-2$, and their product is $\boxed{-8}$.
Since the cone is tangent to all sides of the base of the prism, the base of the prism is a square
Furthermore, if the radius of the base of the cone is $r$, then the side length of the square is $2r$.
Let $h$ be the common height of the cone and the prism
Then the volume of the cone is \[\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h,\] and the volume of the prism is $(2r)^2 h = 4r^2 h$, so the desired ratio is \[\frac{\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h}{4r^2 h} = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{12}}.\]
Let the ratio of side lengths between the similar triangle and the given triangle be $x$, so the lengths of the similar triangle are $6x$, $7x$, and $9x$
We are given that $6x+7x+9x=110$; solving yields $x=\frac{110}{(6+7+9)} = \frac{110}{22}=5$
The length of the longest side is thus $9x = 9 \cdot 5 = \boxed{45}$.
Draw horizontal diameters of both circles to form two rectangles, both surrounding shaded regions
The height of each rectangle is a radius and the length is a diameter, so the left rectangle is 2 ft $\times$ 4 ft and the right rectangle is 4 ft $\times$ 8 ft
The shaded region is obtained by subtracting respective semicircles from each rectangle, so the total area of the shaded region in square feet is $A = [(2)(4) - \dfrac{1}{2}\pi \cdot(2)^2] +
[(4)(8) - \dfrac{1}{2}\pi \cdot(4)^2] = 40 - 10\pi \approx \boxed{8.6}$.
Equivalently, we could notice that since the right side of the figure is scaled up from the left side by a factor of 2, areas will be scaled by a factor of $2^2 = 4$, and the right shaded region will be 4 times the size of the left shaded region
Then $A = 5[(2)(4) - \dfrac{1}{2}\pi \cdot(2)^2],$ giving the same result.
A rotation by 480 degrees is the same as one by $480 - 360 = 120$
The first $40$ degrees of this rotation will be used to decrease the angle $ACB$ to $0$ degrees, leaving $80$ unused degrees, so our answer is $\boxed{80}$ degrees.
Let $\angle MBQ = x$, so $\angle MBP=x$ as well
Therefore, we have $\angle PBQ = 2x$, so $\angle ABP = \angle PBQ = \angle QBC = 2x$
Finally, we have $\angle ABQ = \angle ABP + \angle PBQ = 4x$, so  \[\frac{\angle MBQ}{\angle ABQ} = \frac{x}{4x} = \boxed{\frac14}.\]
Let $r$ be the radius of each of the six congruent circles, and let $A$ and $B$ be the centers of two adjacent circles
Join the centers of adjacent circles to form a regular hexagon with side $2r$
Let $O$ be the center of $\cal C$
Draw the radii of $\cal C$ that contain $A$ and $B$
Triangle $ABO$ is equilateral, so $OA=OB=2r$
Because each of the two radii contains the point where the smaller circle is tangent to $\cal
C$, the radius of $\cal C$ is $3r$, and $K=\pi\left((3r)^2-6r^2\right)=3\pi r^2$
The radius of $\cal C$ is 30, so $r=10$, $K=300\pi$, and $\lfloor K\rfloor=\boxed{942}$.

Since $\triangle XYZ$ is a right triangle with $\angle X = 90^\circ$, we have $\tan Z = \frac{XY}{XZ}$
Since $\tan Z = 3$, we have $XY = 3k$ and $XZ = k$ for some value of $k$, as shown in the diagram
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem gives $YZ^2 = (3k)^2 + k^2 = 10k^2$, so $YZ = k\sqrt{10}$.
Finally, we have $\cos Z = \frac{XZ}{YZ} = \frac{k}{k\sqrt{10}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{10}}{10}}$.
12 inches of the pattern contains one semicircle on top and on bottom for each diameter, or $\frac{12}{2}\cdot2=12$ total semicircles
This is the equivalent of 6 full circles, so the shaded area is $6\cdot1^2\pi=\boxed{6\pi}$ square inches.
The ice cream sphere has volume $\frac{4}{3}\pi(2^3) = \frac{32\pi}{3}$ cubic inches
Let the height of the cylindrical region be $h$; then, the volume of the cylindrical region is $\pi (8^2)h=64\pi h$
Thus, we have \[\frac{32\pi}{3} = 64\pi h.\] Dividing both sides by $64\pi$ yields $h = \boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$ inches.
First of all, let us draw one of these pieces in question, labeling points of interest as necessary: [asy]

[/asy] Since $\angle MOB$ is half of $\angle AOB,$ which is a third of a full circle, we have $\angle MOB = 60^\circ,$ so $\triangle MOB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle
Since the diameter of the pie is $12\text{ cm},$ we see that $OB = 6\text{ cm},$ so $MO = 3\text{ cm}$ and $MB = 3\sqrt{3}\text{ cm}.$ Then, $AB = 2 \cdot MB = 6\sqrt{3}\text{ cm},$ so $l = 6\sqrt{3}.$ Finally, $l^2 = \boxed{108}.$
Rotating the point $(1,0)$ about the origin by $90^\circ$ counterclockwise gives us the point $(0,1)$, so $\cos 90^\circ = \boxed{0}$.
Our triangle is as shown below.

Since $\tan{M}=\frac{5}{4}$, we have $\dfrac{NO}{OM} = \dfrac{5}{4}$, so  $$NO = \frac{5}{4}OM = \frac{5}{4}\cdot 8 = 10.$$Then, from the Pythagorean Theorem, we have \begin{align*}
MN&=\sqrt{NO^2+OM^2}\\
&=\sqrt{10^2+8^2}=\sqrt{164}=\boxed{2\sqrt{41}}.\end{align*}
Regions I, II, and III combine to form a sector of a circle whose central angle measures 90 degrees
Therefore, the area of this sector is $\frac{90}{360}\pi(\text{radius})^2=\frac{1}{4}\pi(2)^2=\pi$ square centimeters
Also, regions I and II combine to form an isosceles right triangle whose area is $\frac{1}{2}(\text{base})(\text{height})=\frac{1}{2}(AB)(BC)=\frac{1}{2}(2)(2)=2$ square centimeters
Subtracting these two areas, we find that the area of region III is $\pi-2$ square centimeters
Since region II is congruent to region III, the combined area of region II and region III is $2(\pi-2)=2\pi-4\approx \boxed{2.3}$ square centimeters.
The probability of winning on one spin is equal to the ratio of the area of the WIN sector to the area of the entire circle
The area of the entire circle is $\pi \cdot 5^2 = 25\pi$
In math terms, our ratio is: $\frac{2}{5}=\frac{\text{area of the win sector}}{25\pi}$
Solving for the area of the win sector, we find it equal to $\boxed{10\pi}$ square centimeters.
The vertices of the triangle are the points where two of the lines intersect
The line  $y=\frac{1}{2}x+3$ intersects $y=1$ when  $$\frac{1}{2}x+3=1\Rightarrow x=-4.$$ The line $y=-2x+6$ intersects $y=1$ when  $$-2x+6=1\Rightarrow x=\frac{5}{2}.$$  The line $y=\frac{1}{2}x+3$ intersects $y=-2x+6$ when  $$\frac{1}{2}x+3=-2x+6\Rightarrow x=\frac{6}{5}.$$ and  $$y=-2\left(\frac{6}{5}\right)+6=\frac{18}{5}$$
Thus the vertices of the triangle are $(-4,1)$, $\left(\frac{5}{2},1\right)$, and $\left(\frac{6}{5},\frac{18}{5}\right)$
We can let the base of the triangle lie along the line $y=1$
It will have length  $$4+\frac{5}{2}=\frac{13}{2}.$$  The altitude from $\left(\frac{6}{5},\frac{18}{5}\right)$ to this line will have length  $$\frac{18}{5}-1=\frac{13}{5}.$$ Thus the area of the triangle is $$\frac{1}{2}*\frac{13}{2}*\frac{13}{5}=\frac{169}{20}=\boxed{8.45}.$$
Because $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF,$ we know that: \begin{align*}
\frac{EF}{ED} &= \frac{BC}{BA} \\
\frac{EF}{3\text{ cm}} &= \frac{8\text{ cm}}{5\text{ cm}} \\
EF &= \frac{8\text{ cm}\cdot3\text{ cm}}{5\text{ cm}} = \boxed{4.8}\text{ cm}.

[/asy] Consider the three right triangles $T_1, T_2, T_3$ formed by the line $AB$, the segment connecting the bottom left corner of the smallest square to the upper right corner of the largest square, and a side of the smallest, medium, and largest squares, respectively
Since all three triangles share an angle, it follows that they must be similar
Notice that the base of $T_3$ is equal to $2+4+6 = 12$, and its height is equal to $6$
This, the height-to-base ratio of each of $T_1$ and $T_2$ is equal to $6/12 = 1/2$
Since the base of $T_1$ is $2$ and the base of $T_2$ is $2+4 = 6$, it follows that their heights are, respectively, $2 \cdot (1/2) = 1$ and $6 \cdot (1/2) = 3$
The shaded region is a trapezoid with bases $1$ and $3$ and altitude $4$, and area $\frac{4(1+3)}{2} = \boxed{8}$.

[/asy] We now see that $CK = BC - BK = 6.$ That means $\triangle AKC$ is a $3:4:5$ right triangle, so $AK = 8.$ At this point, we can see that the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot AK \cdot BC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 13 = \boxed{52}.$
A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\frac{1}{3}\pi (1^2)(4)=\frac{4}{3}\pi$
A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \[\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3=\frac{4}{3}\pi.\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$
The sphere's radius is $\boxed{1}$ inch.
The radius of the inner circle must be 2 feet
The area of the gray region is the area of the outer circle minus the area of the inner circle, or just $\pi\cdot 4^2 - \pi\cdot 2^2 = \boxed{12\pi}$.
Let $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $300^\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.

Triangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \frac{1}{2}$ and $DP = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(\frac12,-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$, so $\sin300^\circ = \boxed{-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.
The area of a semi-circle with radius $r$ is $\frac{1}{2}\pi r^2$ so the area of a semi-circle with diameter $d$ is $\frac{1}{2}\pi \left( \frac{1}{2}d \right)^2 = \frac{1}{8}\pi d^2$.
The semicircles with diameters $UV$, $VW$, $WX$, $XY$, and $YZ$ each have equal diameter and thus equal area
The area of each of these semicircles is $\frac{1}{8}\pi(5^2)=\frac{25}{8}\pi$.
The large semicircle has diameter $UZ = 5(5)=25$, so has area $\frac{1}{8}\pi (25^2)=\frac{625}{8}\pi$.
The shaded area equals the area of the large semicircle, minus the area of two small semicircles, plus the area of three small semicircles, which equals the area of the large semicircle plus the area of one small semicircle
Therefore, the shaded area equals $$\frac{625}{8}\pi + \frac{25}{8}\pi = \frac{650}{8}\pi = \boxed{\frac{325}{4}\pi}.$$
The circumference of the whole circle is $2 \pi \cdot 4 = 8 \pi$
Then the circumference of the base of the cone is \[\frac{270^\circ}{360^\circ} \cdot 8 \pi = \boxed{6 \pi}.\]
Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$
We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$
Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\cdot yz \cdot xz = 15\cdot10\cdot6 \Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$
Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\sqrt{900}=\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.
The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the hypotenuse
The hypotenuse of $\triangle ABC$ is $\sqrt{3^2+4^2} = 5$, so $AM = BC/2 = \boxed{2.5}$.

[/asy] All angles are given in degrees.
Let $\angle ECB = y$, so $\angle DBC=3y$
From $\triangle AEC$ we have $\angle ACE = 180^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ= 30^\circ$.
Now let $EC$ and $BD$ intersect at $F$
$\angle BFE=\angle DFC$ by vertical angles and $\angle BEF=\angle CDF=90^\circ$, so $\angle FBE=\angle FCD$, which is equal to 30 degrees
Now summing the angles in $\triangle ABC$, we have $60^\circ+30^\circ+3y+y+30^\circ=180$, solving yields $4y=60$ so $y=15$ and we see $\triangle BDC$ is a 45-45-90 triangle
Also, $\triangle ABD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.
Let $ AD = x$, so $AB = 2x$ and $DB = DC = x\sqrt{3}$
$BC = x\sqrt{3}\sqrt{2} = x\sqrt{6}$
We are given that this equals 12, so we find $x = 12/\sqrt{6} = 2\sqrt{6}$
It follows that the area of $\triangle ABC$ can be found via  \[(1/2)(AC)(BD)=(1/2)(x+x\sqrt{3})(x\sqrt{3})=12\sqrt{3}+36.\] To find $EC$, notice that the area of $\triangle ABC$ can also be written as $(1/2)(AB)(EC)$
Thus, \[(1/2)(4\sqrt{6})(EC)=12\sqrt{3}+36 \Rightarrow EC = 3(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{6}).\]  Hence $a=3$, $b=2$, and $c=6$, so $a+b+c=\boxed{11}$.
Let us first call the point where the $x$-axis intersects side $\overline{AB}$ point $E$ and where it intersects $\overline{CD}$ point $F$

[/asy] Now, since the $x$-axis is parallel to bases $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BC}$ of the parallelogram, $\overline{EF}$ is parallel to the two bases and splits parallelogram $ABCD$ into two smaller parallelograms $AEFD$ and $EBCF$
Since the height of each of these parallelograms is $3$ and the length of their bases equals $AD=BC=6$, both parallelograms must have the same area
Half of parallelogram $ABCD$'s area is above the $x$-axis and half is below, so there is a $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that the point selected is not above the $x$-axis.
The measure of the base of the parallelogram is 6 units and the height of the parallelogram is 8 units
Therefore, the area of the parallel is $(6)(8)=\boxed{48}$ square units

[/asy] Since $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, that makes $\angle BDC$ a right angle
That means that $BD$ is an altitude of $\triangle ABC.$ Then, we use the area formula to find $150 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot BD,$ where $AC = 25.$ Solving, we have $BD = \boxed{12}.$
We begin by drawing a diagram: [asy]
pair A,B,C,D,X,Y,H;
A=(-12,12*sqrt(3)); D=(0,0); C=(12,12*sqrt(3)); B=(0,5+12*sqrt(3)); X=(B+C)/2; Y=(A+D)/2; H=(A+C)/2;

[/asy] We draw diagonals $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ and let the intersection point be $H$
Since $\angle ADC=60^\circ$ and $AD=CD$, $\triangle ACD$ is equilateral, so $AC=24$
Since $ABCD$ has two pairs of equal sides, it is a kite, and so its diagonals are perpendicular and $\overline{BD}$ bisects $\overline{AC}$
Thus, \[AH=HC=24/2=12.\]Applying the Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle BHC$ and $\triangle CHD$ gives \[BH=\sqrt{BC^2-HC^2}=\sqrt{13^2-12^2}=5\]and \[HD=\sqrt{CD^2-HC^2}=\sqrt{24^2-12^2}=12\sqrt{3}.\][asy]

Let $Y'$ be the midpoint of $\overline{CD}$
We look at triangle $BCD$
Since segment $\overline{XY'}$ connects midpoints $X$ and $Y'$, it is parallel to $\overline{BD}$ and has half the length of $\overline{BD}$
Thus, \[XY' = \frac{1}{2}(BH+HD)=\frac{1}{2}(5+12\sqrt{3}).\]Now, we look at triangle $ACD$
Similarly, since $Y$ and $Y'$ are midpoints, $\overline{YY'}$ is parallel to $\overline{AC}$ and has half the length of $\overline{AC}$, so \[YY' = 24/2=12.\]Since $\overline{BD} \perp \overline{AC}$, we have $\overline{XY'}\perp \overline{YY'}$, so $\angle XY'Y=90^\circ$
Finally, we use the Pythagorean theorem on $\triangle XY'Y$ to compute \begin{align*}
XY^2=YY'^2+XY'^2&=12^2+\left(\frac{1}{2}(5+12\sqrt{3})\right)^2\\
&=144+\frac{1}{4}(25+120\sqrt{3}+144\cdot 3) \\
&= \boxed{\frac{1033}{4}+30\sqrt{3}}
\end{align*}
The base of the hemisphere is a circle with radius 6 and area $6^2\pi=36\pi$
The curved top of the hemisphere has half the surface area of a full sphere, which has surface area $4\pi(6^2)=144\pi$, so the curved top of the hemisphere has $144\pi/2=72\pi$
The total surface area of the hemisphere is $36\pi+72\pi=\boxed{108\pi}$.
The fly's journey traces out the three sides of triangle
Because one side of this triangle is a diameter of the circular ceiling and the other two sides are chords of this circle, the triangle is a right triangle
If the radius of the circular room is 58 feet, then the diameter is $2 \times 58 = 116$ feet
This is the hypotenuse of the right triangle
One of the legs is 80 feet, so the other leg must be equal to $\sqrt{116^2 - 80^2} = \sqrt{(13{,}456 - 6400)} = \sqrt{7056} = 84$ feet
The total distance traveled by the fly is $116 + 84 + 80 = \boxed{280}$ feet.
Each side of the smaller cube is half that of the larger cube, so the ratio of the volumes is $\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) ^3 = \boxed{\frac{1}{8}}.$
We find the coordinates of point $B$ by solving $3x-2y = 1$ and $y = 1$ simultaneously
With $y=1,$ we get $3x-2=1,$ and so $x=1.$ Thus, $B=(1,1).$ The distance from $A$ to line $l_2$ is $1 - (-2) = 3,$ so we have \[\tfrac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot 3 = [\triangle ABC] = 3,\]and thus $BC = 2.$ Therefore, either $C = (3, 1)$ or $C = (-1, 1).$ If $C = (3, 1),$ then the slope of $l_3$ is $\tfrac{1-(-2)}{3-(-1)} = \tfrac{3}{4},$ and if $C=(-1,1)$, then $l_3$ is a vertical line, so its slope is undefined
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\tfrac34}.$

Since $\triangle XYZ$ is a right triangle with $\angle X = 90^\circ$, we have $\tan Z = \frac{XY}{XZ}$
Since $\tan Z = 7$, we have $XY = 7k$ and $XZ = k$ for some value of $k$, as shown in the diagram
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem gives $(7k)^2 + k^2 = 100^2$, so $50k^2 = 100^2$, which gives $k^2 = 100^2/50 = 200$
Since $k$ must be positive, we have $k = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}$, so $XY = 7k = \boxed{70\sqrt{2}}$.
Since $AB$ and $BC$ are positive integers and $AB < BC$, $BC - AB$ must be at least 1.
The triangle with side lengths $AB = 650$, $BC = 651$, and $AC = 706$ satisfies the given conditions, and for this triangle $BC - AB = 1$.
Therefore, the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$ is $\boxed{1}$.
Since the image is reflected across the $y$-axis first, we will just change the sign of the $x$-coordinate, which will give us $(2, 6)$
Next the image is shifted down 8 units so we will subtract 8 from the $y$-coordinate, giving our image a final center of $\boxed{(2, -2)}$.
$\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle, since $9^2 + 12^2 = 15^2$
Thus, $\angle ABC = 90^\circ$.

By the angle bisector theorem, $BD/AD = BC/AC$, so \[BD = \frac{BC}{BC + AC} \cdot AB = \frac{4}{9} \cdot 9 = 4.\] Then by use of the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $BCD$, $CD = \sqrt{BC^2 + BD^2} = \sqrt{12^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{160} = \boxed{4 \sqrt{10}}$.
Call the center of the circle O, and call the point where the radius of the circle bisects the chord E
Thus, the line segment from the center of the circle to point E has length 2, and we have $\triangle ODE$ with a leg of 2 and a hypotenuse of 3
Thus, the other leg, DE has length $\sqrt{5}$, and since DE is $\frac{CD}{2}$, we have $CD = \boxed{2\sqrt{5}}$.
Let $E,H$, and $F$ be the centers of circles $A,B$, and $D$, respectively, and let $G$ be the point of tangency of circles $B$ and $C$
Let $x=FG$ and $y=GH$
Since the center of circle $D$ lies on circle $A$ and the circles have a common point of tangency, the radius of circle $D$ is $2$, which is the diameter of circle $A$
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to right triangles $EGH$ and $FGH$ gives \[
(1+y)^{2}= (1+x)^{2} + y^{2} \quad\text{and}\quad (2-y)^{2}= x^{2} + y^{2},
\] from which it follows that \[
y= x + \frac{x^2}{2} \quad\text{and}\quad y= 1 - \frac{x^2}{4}.
\] The solutions of this system are $(x,y)=(2/3, 8/9)$ and $(x,y)=(-2, 0)$
The radius of circle $B$ is the positive solution for $y$, which is $\boxed{\frac{8}{9}}$.

$\angle CDF = \angle AEB$ and $\angle BAE = \angle CFD$, so we know that $\bigtriangleup AEB \sim \bigtriangleup FDC$
Thus, denoting the side length of $BEFC$ as $x$, we can create the ratios: $\frac{28}{x} = \frac{x}{58} \Rightarrow x^2 = 1624$, and since $x^2$ is the area of square $BCFE$, $\boxed{1624}$ is the answer.

We can think of $TAB$ as the base of the pyramid, and $\overline{CT}$ as the height from apex $C$ to the base, since $\overline{CT}$ is perpendicular to face $ABT$
The area of right triangle $ABT$ is $(10)(10)/2 = 50$ square units, so the volume of the pyramid is $\frac13([ABT])(CT) = \frac13(50)(9) = \boxed{150}$ cubic units.
First note that the area of the region determined by the triangle topped by the semicircle of diameter 1 is \[

\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{1}{8}\pi.
\] The area of the lune results from subtracting from this the area of the sector of the larger semicircle, \[
\frac{1}{6}\pi(1)^2 = \frac{1}{6}\pi.
\] So the area of the lune is \[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{1}{8}\pi -\frac{1}{6}\pi=\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} - \frac{1}{24}\pi}.

[/asy] By the Pythagorean theorem, $r^2+s^2=e^2.$ Furthermore, we have $r=b-d$ and $s=c-a,$ which are integers because $a,b,c,$ and $d$ are integers
Thus, $e$ must be the hypotenuse of some Pythagorean triple
The possibilities for that triple are $$\{5,12,13\},\quad\{12,16,20\},\quad\{15,20,25\},\quad\{7,24,25\}.$$Also, the leg lengths $r=b-d$ and $s=c-a$ must be among the pairwise differences of the given numbers
Since $16,$ $15$ and $24$ do not appear among any of the pairwise differences of $\{13,19,20,25,31\},$ the only possible triple is $\{5,12,13\}.$ Then we may take $r=b-d=5$ and $s=c-a=12,$ and this forces $a=19,$ $b=25,$ $c=31,$ $d=20$ and $e=13.$ Hence, the area of the pentagon is $$bc - \frac12 rs = 31 \cdot 25 -\frac 12(12\cdot 5)= 775-30=\boxed{745}.$$
Since $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, $\angle C = 20$ degrees

The overlap of the two squares is quadrilateral $CDEH$
The area of each square is 16, so the side length of each square is $\sqrt{16} = 4$.
Then $DE = 4$ and $HE = EF/2 = 4/2 = 2$, so the area of triangle $DEH$ is $DE \cdot EH/2 = 4 \cdot 2/2 = 4$
By symmetry, the area of triangle $CDH$ is also 4, so the area of quadrilateral $CDEH$ is $4 + 4 = 8$.
Then the area of pentagon $ADEHB$ is $16 - 8 = 8$, and the area of pentagon $CDGFH$ is also $16 - 8 = 8$
Hence, the area of polygon $ABHFGD$ is $8 + 8 + 8 = \boxed{24}$.
The side length of the triangle and hexagon are $\frac{a}{3}$ and $\frac{b}{6},$ respectively, so their areas are \[\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \left(\frac{a}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2 \sqrt3}{36} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3\sqrt3}{2} \left(\frac{b}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2\sqrt3}{24},\]respectively
Therefore, we have \[\frac{a^2\sqrt3}{36} = \frac{b^2\sqrt3}{24},\]so \[\frac{a^2}{b^2} = \frac{36}{24} = \frac{3}{2}.\]Taking the square root of both sides, we get \[\frac{a}{b} = \frac{\sqrt3}{\sqrt2} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt6}2}.\]
First, from triangle $ABO$, $\angle AOB = 180^\circ - \angle BAO - \angle ABO$
Note that $AO$ bisects $\angle BAT$ (to see this, draw radii from $O$ to $AB$ and $AT,$ creating two congruent right triangles), so $\angle BAO = \angle BAT/2$
Similarly, $\angle ABO = \angle ABR/2$.
Also, $\angle BAT = 180^\circ - \angle BAP$, and $\angle ABR = 180^\circ - \angle ABP$
Hence, \begin{align*}
\angle AOB &= 180^\circ - \angle BAO - \angle ABO \\
&= 180^\circ - \frac{\angle BAT}{2} - \frac{\angle ABR}{2} \\
&= 180^\circ - \frac{180^\circ - \angle BAP}{2} - \frac{180^\circ - \angle ABP}{2} \\
&= \frac{\angle BAP + \angle ABP}{2}.
\end{align*}
Finally, from triangle $ABP$, $\angle BAP + \angle ABP = 180^\circ - \angle APB = 180^\circ - 40^\circ = 140^\circ$, so \[\angle AOB = \frac{\angle BAP + \angle ABP}{2} = \frac{140^\circ}{2} = \boxed{70^\circ}.\]

Because this is a right triangle, $\tan X = \frac{YZ}{XZ}$.
Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we find $XZ = \sqrt{XY^2 - YZ^2} = \sqrt{100-51} = 7$.
So $\tan X = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{51}}{7}}$.
Since triangle $B^\prime I^\prime G^\prime$ is translated from triangle $BIG,$ the midpoint of $B^\prime G ^\prime $ is the midpoint of $BG$ translated five units left and two units up
The midpoint of $BG$ is at $\left( \frac{1+5}{2}, \frac{1+1}{2} \right) = (3, 1).$ Thus, the midpoint of $B ^\prime G ^\prime$ is at $(3-5,1+2)=\boxed{(-2,3)}.$

As $AF = 2$, it follows that $AP = 1$ and $PF = \sqrt{3}$
Also, $AB = 2$ and so $AX = 3AB = 6$
Thus, $PX = AP + AX = 7$
In right triangle $FPX$, by the Pythagorean Theorem, it follows that $$FX^2 = PF^2 + PX^2 = (\sqrt{3})^2 + (7)^2 = 52,$$and $FX = \sqrt{52} = \boxed{2\sqrt{13}}$.

Thus $AE=\frac{5AB}{9}$, $AB=\sqrt{3^2+6^2}=\sqrt{45}=3\sqrt{5}$, and $AE=\frac{5(3\sqrt{5})}{9}=\boxed{\frac{5\sqrt{5}}{3}}$

Let the height of the wide can be $h$ and the height of the narrow can be $3h$
Let the wide can have radius $x$ units
Since the two volumes are equal, we have \[\pi (12^2) (3h) = \pi (x^2) (h).\] Solving yields $x = 12\sqrt{3}$ so the wide can has radius $\boxed{12\sqrt{3}}$ units.
We first notice that the vertical and horizontal distances between the two points are both $4$, so the slope of the line which the two points are on must be $1$
We now find the length of the legs of the triangle
Since the slope of the line is one, we can add $2$ to both the $x$ and $y$-coordinates of $(-2,6)$ and get that the line passes through $(0,8)$
Similarly, we can subtract $2$ from the $x$ and $y$-coordinates of $(-6,2)$ to find that it passes through $(-8,0)$
We now have a right triangle with legs of length $8$, so its area is $\frac{1}{2}bh=\frac{1}{2}(8)(8)=\boxed{32}$ square units.
Let $x$ be the number of degrees in the measure of angle $A$
Then angle $B$ measures $x$ degrees as well and angle $C$ measures $x+30$ degrees
Since the sum of the interior angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we solve $x+x+x+30=180$ to find $x=50$
Therefore, angle $C$ measures $x+30=50+30=\boxed{80}$ degrees.
The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $XZ= \sqrt{YZ^2 - XY^2} = \sqrt{625-576} = \sqrt{49}=7$, so $\tan Y = \frac{XZ}{XY} = \ \boxed{\frac{7}{24}}$.
The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $FH= \sqrt{FG^2 - GH^2} = \sqrt{289-225} = \sqrt{64}=8$, so $\tan G = \frac{FH}{HG} = \ \boxed{\frac{8}{15}}$.
Define the points $A$, $B$, $C$ , and $D$, $E$, and $F$ as shown so that $AC$ is perpendicular to the base of the pyramid
Segment $DC$ is a leg of the isosceles right triangle $CDF$ whose hypotenuse is $8\sqrt{2}$
Therefore, $CD=8\sqrt{2}/\sqrt{2}=8$
Applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $ACD$ gives $AC=6$
Since $BC=3$, this implies that $AB=3$
By the similarity of $ABE$ and $ACD$, we find $BE=4$
The diagonal of the smaller square is $2\cdot BE = 8$, so its area is $8^2/2=32$
The volume of the pyramid is $\frac{1}{3}(\text{base area})(\text{height})=\frac{1}{3}(32)(3)=\boxed{32}$ cubic units.

Note that since the area is $\pi r^2 = 324 \pi$, where $r$ is the radius, we must have $r=\sqrt{324}=18$
Thus the distance from the center of the hexagon to a vertex is $18$, and we can break up the hexagon into $6$ equilateral triangles, each of which has side length $18$
The area of an equilateral triangle of side length $s$ is $\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}$, so the area of each equilateral triangle is $81 \sqrt{3}$, making the total $6(81 \sqrt{3}) = \boxed{486 \sqrt{3}}$.
Point $M$ has coordinates $(7,8)$
Therefore, its image has coordinates $(7,-8)$
Thus the sum is $7-8 = \boxed{-1}$.
Alternatively, the image of point $M$ is the midpoint of the images of points $P$ and $R$ and thus is the midpoint of $(2,-1)$ and $(12,-15)$, which is also $(7,-8)$.
Since $AB\parallel EF,$ we know that $\angle BAC = \angle FEC$ and $\angle ABC = \angle EFC.$ Therefore, we see that $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle EFC$ by AA Similarity
Likewise, $\triangle BDC \sim \triangle BEF.$
From our similarities, we can come up with two equations: $\dfrac{BF}{BC} = \dfrac{EF}{DC}$ and $\dfrac{FC}{BC} = \dfrac{EF}{AB}.$
Since we have $AB$ and $DC$ and we want to find $EF,$ we want all the other quantities to disappear
Since $BF + FC = BC,$ we try adding our two equations: \begin{align*}
\frac{BF}{BC} + \frac{FC}{BC} &= \frac{EF}{DC} + \frac{EF}{AB}.\\
\frac{BC}{BC} = 1 &= EF\left(\frac{1}{DC} + \frac{1}{AB}\right)\\
\frac{1}{\frac{1}{DC} + \frac{1}{AB}} &= EF
\end{align*} Now we plug in $DC = 100\text{ cm}$ and $AB = 150\text{ cm},$ giving us $EF = \boxed{60}\text{ cm}.$
The height of the cone is $\frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6$
The radius of the cone is $\frac{8}{2} = 4$
Therefore, the volume of the cone formed is $\frac{4^2 \times 6 \times \pi}{3} = \boxed{32 \pi}$.
Suppose that our two-gallon container is in the shape of a rectangular prism
If we triple the length, the volume triples
Tripling the width or the height gives us the same result
Therefore, tripling all of the dimensions increases the volume by a factor of $3\cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27$
The new container can hold $2 \times 27 = \boxed{54}$ gallons.
The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the point with its image under the reflection
The slope of the segment is $\frac{3-(-1)}{5-(-3)}=\frac{1}{2}$
Since the line of reflection is perpendicular, its slope, $m$, equals $-2$
By the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment is $\left(\frac{5-3}2,\frac{3-1}2\right)=(1,1)$
Since the line of reflection goes through this point, we have $1=(-2)(1)+b$, and so $b=3$
Thus $m+b=\boxed{1}.$
The piece that is removed from the original pyramid to create the frustum is itself a square pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid
The ratio of corresponding side lengths is 1/4, so the piece that was removed has volume $(1/4)^3 = 1/64$ of the volume of the original pyramid
Therefore, the remaining frustum has volume $1-(1/64) = \boxed{\frac{63}{64}}$ of the original pyramid.
By the Pythagorean theorem, we have: \begin{align*}
AC^2 &= AB^2 + BC^2 = 1+1 = 2; \\
AD^2 &= AC^2 + CD^2 = 2+1 = 3; \\
AE^2 &= AD^2 + DE^2 = 3+1 = 4.
\end{align*}Thus $AE=\sqrt 4=2,$ and the perimeter of pentagon $ABCDE$ is $1+1+1+1+2 = \boxed{6}$.
Rotating the point $(1,0)$ about the origin by $0^\circ$ counterclockwise gives us the point $(1,0)$, so $\cos 0^\circ = \boxed{1}$.
The amount of steel used to create one ball with radius 1 is $\frac{4}{3}\pi(1^3)=\frac{4}{3}\pi$; the amount of steel used to create eight of these balls is $8\cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi = \frac{32}{3}\pi$.
Let the radius of the large steel be $r$
We have $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{32}{3}\pi$; solving for $r$ yields $r^3 = 8 \Rightarrow r = 2$
Thus the radius of the large ball is $\boxed{2}$ inches.
Faces: There are $3$ on the sides, a top face, and a bottom face, so $5$.
Edges: There are $3$ on the top, $3$ on the bottom, and $3$ connecting them, for $9$.
Vertices: There are $3$ on the top and $3$ on the bottom, for $6$.
So $5+9+6=\boxed{20}$.

Since $D$ and $E$ are midpoints, $\overline{CD}$ and $\overline{BE}$ are medians
Let $F$ be the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$; we draw median $\overline{AF}$
The medians of a triangle are always concurrent (pass through the same point), so $\overline{AF}$ passes through $X$ as well.
pair A,B,C,D,E,X,F;
A=(0,9); B=(0,0); C=(13,0); E=(A+C)/2; D=(A+B)/2; X = intersectionpoint(B--E,D--C); label("$X$",X,N);

The three medians cut triangle $ABC$ into six smaller triangles
These six smaller triangles all have the same area
(To see why, look at $\overline{BC}$ and notice that $\triangle BXF$ and $\triangle CXF$ have the same area since they share an altitude and have equal base lengths, and $\triangle ABF$ and $\triangle ACF$ have the same area for the same reason
Thus, $\triangle ABX$ and $\triangle ACX$ have the same area
We can repeat this argument with all three sizes of triangles built off the other two sides $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{AB}$, to see that the six small triangles must all have the same area.)
Quadrilateral $AEXD$ is made up of two of these small triangles and triangle $BXC$ is made up of two of these small triangles as well
Hence they have the same area (and this will hold true no matter what type of triangle $\triangle ABC$ is)
Thus, the ratio of the area of quadrilateral $AEXD$ to the area of triangle $BXC$ is $1/1=\boxed{1}$.
We must find the length of each side of the hexagon to find the perimeter.
We can see that the distance between each pair of points $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 2)$, $(2, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$, and $(2, 1)$ and $(3, 1)$ is 1
Thus, these three sides have a total length of 3.
We can see that the distance between $(0, 1)$ and $(1, 2)$ is $\sqrt 2$
The distance between $(3, 1)$ and $(2, 0)$ is also $\sqrt 2$
These two sides have a total length of $2\sqrt 2$.
We can see that the distance between $(2, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$ is $\sqrt 5$
Thus, the last side has length of $\sqrt 5$.
Summing all of these distances, we find that the perimeter is ${3 + 2\sqrt 2 + 1\sqrt 5}$, so $a+b+c=\boxed{6}$.

[/asy] Since $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, we might try extending $BI$ to meet $AC$ at $D.$ That is advantageous to us since it will also be the perpendicular bisector and median to side $AC.$ In addition, let us draw a radius from $I$ that meets $AB$ at $E.$ [asy]
pair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pI;
pA = (-1, 0);
pB = (0, 0);
pC = (0, 1);
pD = (-0.5, 0.5);

label("$E$", pE, S);
[/asy] Given $r$ as the inradius, we can see that $DI = r$ and $IB = r\sqrt{2},$ since $\triangle IEB$ is also a little isosceles right triangle on its own
Therefore, $BD = r\sqrt{2} + r = r (\sqrt{2} + 1).$
However, we have a nice way of finding $BD,$ from $\triangle ABD,$ which is also an isosceles right triangle, thus $DB = \frac{AB}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{4 \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 4.$
Setting the two expressions for $DB$ equal, we have: \begin{align*}
r(\sqrt{2} + 1) &= 4 \\
r &= \frac{4}{\sqrt{2} + 1} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{2} + 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{\sqrt{2} - 1} \\
&= \frac{4(\sqrt{2} - 1)}{1} = 4\sqrt{2} - 4.
\end{align*} Our answer is $BI = r\sqrt{2} = (4\sqrt{2} - 4)\cdot \sqrt{2} = \boxed{8 - 4\sqrt{2}}.$
We can look at the region as a rectangle with a smaller staircase-shaped region removed from its upper-right corner
We extend two of its sides to complete the rectangle: [asy]
size(120);
draw((5,7)--(0,7)--(0,0)--(9,0)--(9,3)--(8,3)--(8,4)--(7,4)--(7,5)--(6,5)--(6,6)--(5,6)--cycle);
draw((5,7)--(9,7)--(9,3),dashed);
[/asy] Dissecting the small staircase, we see it consists of ten 1 ft by 1 ft squares and thus has area 10 square feet
size(120);
draw((5,7)--(0,7)--(0,0)--(9,0)--(9,3)--(8,3)--(8,4)--(7,4)--(7,5)--(6,5)--(6,6)--(5,6)--cycle);
draw((5,7)--(9,7)--(9,3),dashed);
draw((8,7)--(8,4)--(9,4),dashed); draw((7,7)--(7,5)--(9,5),dashed); draw((6,7)--(6,6)--(9,6),dashed);
[/asy] Let the height of the rectangle have length $x$ feet, so the area of the rectangle is $9x$ square feet
Thus we can write the area of the staircase-shaped region as $9x-10$
Setting this equal to $53$ and solving for $x$ yields $9x-10=53 \Rightarrow x=7$ feet.
Finally, the perimeter of the region is $7+9+3+5+8\cdot 1 = \boxed{32}$ feet
(Notice how this is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle -- if we shift each horizontal side with length 1 upwards and each vertical side with length 1 rightwards, we get a rectangle.)
A right triangle with a $30^\circ$ angle is a 30-60-90 triangle
In such a triangle, the hypotenuse has twice the length of the leg opposite the $30^\circ$ angle, so the hypotenuse of the triangle in the problem has length $2\cdot 12 = \boxed{24}$ inches.
We begin with a diagram of the given information: [asy]

real x=sqrt(3);
pair d=(2,0); pair c=(1,x); pair b=(-1,x); pair a=-d; pair f=-c; pair e=-b;

To increase the symmetry in the diagram, we can draw in the long diagonals of $ABCDEF$ as well as the mirror image of $\triangle GHI$ across these diagonals:
size(4cm);
real x=sqrt(3);
pair d=(2,0); pair c=(1,x); pair b=(-1,x); pair a=-d; pair f=-c; pair e=-b;

These additional lines divide $ABCDEF$ into $24$ congruent equilateral triangles, of which $\triangle GHI$ covers exactly $9$
Thus each of the triangles has area $\frac{225}{9}=25$, and hexagon $ABCDEF$ has area $24\cdot 25=\boxed{600}$.
We can draw two similar hexagons, an outer one for which the large circle is the circumcircle and an inner one that connects the centers of the smaller circles
We know that the sidelength of the inner hexagon is 6 since $\overline{DE}$ consists of the radii of two small circles
We also know that the radius of the outer hexagon is 3 units longer than the radius of the inner hexagon since $\overline{AD}$ is the radius of a small circle
There are now several approaches to solving the problem.
$\emph{Approach 1:}$ We use a 30-60-90 triangle to find the radius $\overline{CD}$ of the inner hexagon
Triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle since $\overline{CE}$ and $\overline{CD}$ are both radii of a regular hexagon
So dropping a perpendicular from $C$ to $\overline{DE}$ bisects $\angle C$ and $\overline{DE}$ and creates two congruent right triangles
The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\frac{360^\circ}{6}=60^\circ$
So $m\angle C=60^\circ$
Each right triangle has a leg of length $\frac{DE}{2}=3$ and is a 30-60-90 right triangle (since $\angle C$ was bisected into two angles of $30^\circ$)
That makes the length of the hypotenuse (the radius of the inner hexagon) two times the length of the short leg, or $2\cdot3=6$
Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\boxed{18}$ units long.
$\emph{Approach 2:}$ We prove that the triangles formed by the center to two vertices of a regular hexagon (such as $\triangle CED$ and $\triangle CBA$) are equilateral triangles
The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\frac{360^\circ}{60}=60^\circ$
So $m\angle C=60^\circ$
The interior angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\frac{180^\circ (6-2)}{6}=\frac{180^\circ \cdot4}{6}=30^\circ \cdot4=120^\circ$
That means the other two angles in the triangle each have a measure of half the interior angle, or $60^\circ$
All three angles equal $60^\circ$ so the triangle is an equilateral triangle
Then we know that $CD=DE=6$
Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\boxed{18}$ units long.
$\emph{Approach 3:}$ Another way to prove that the triangles are equilateral is to show that triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle and $m\angle C=60^\circ$ (see other approaches for how)
That means $m\angle D=m\angle E$ and $m\angle D+ m\angle E=120^\circ$
Then all three angles have a measure of $60^\circ$ each
We continue the rest of approach 2 after proving that triangle $CED$ is equilateral.

Since the volume of a pyramid is linear in each of length, width, and height (in particular, $V = \frac{1}{3} lwh$), multiplying any of these dimensions by a scalar multiplies the volume by the same scalar
So the new volume is $2\cdot 3\cdot 1.50 = 9$ times the old one, or $\boxed{360}$ cubic inches.
The $y$-intercept of the line $y = -\frac{3}{4}x+9$ is $y=9$, so $Q$ has coordinates $(0, 9)$.
To determine the $x$-intercept, we set $y=0$, and so obtain $0 = -\frac{3}{4}x+9$ or $\frac{3}{4}x=9$ or $x=12$
Thus, $P$ has coordinates $(12, 0)$.
Therefore, the area of $\triangle POQ$ is $\frac{1}{2}(12)(9) = 54$, since $\triangle POQ$ is right-angled at $O$.
Since we would like the area of $\triangle TOP$ to be one third that of $\triangle POQ$, then the area of $\triangle TOP$ should be 18.
If $T$ has coordinates $(r, s)$, then $\triangle TOP$ has base $OP$ of length 12 and height $s$, so $\frac{1}{2}(12)(s)=18$ or $6s=18$ or $s=3$.
Since $T$ lies on the line, then $s = -\frac{3}{4}r+9$ or $3=-\frac{3}{4}r+9$ or $\frac{3}{4}r=6$ or $r=8$.
Thus, $r+s=8+3=\boxed{11}$.
Extend $AM$ to $D$ so that $MD = MA$

The semi-perimeter of triangle $ACD$ is $(7 + 15 + 20)/2 = 21$, so by Heron's formula, the area of triangle $ACD$ is $$\sqrt{21 (21 - 7)(21 - 15)(21 - 20)} = \boxed{42}.$$
When you connect the midpoints of two sides of a triangle, you get a segment which is half as long as the third side of the triangle
Therefore, every side in the smaller triangle is $\frac{1}{2}$ the side length of the original triangle
Therefore, the area of the smaller triangle is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$ the area of the larger triangle.
Let $h$ be the distance from $B$ to side $AD$
The area of $ABC$ is 27, so $\frac{1}{2}\cdot6\cdot h = 27$, which implies $h=9$
The area of $BCD$ is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot26\cdot9=\boxed{117}$ square units.

The cylinder with increased radius now has volume  \[\pi (8+x)^2 (3)\] and the cylinder with increased height now has volume \[\pi (8^2) (3+x).\] Setting these two quantities equal and solving yields  \[3(64+16x+x^2)=64(3+x) \Rightarrow 3x^2-16x=x(3x-16)=0\] so $x=0$ or $x=16/3$
The latter is the valid solution, so the increase measures $\boxed{\frac{16}{3}}$ inches.
The centers are at $A=(10,0)$ and $B=(-15,0)$, and the radii are 6 and 9, respectively
Since the internal tangent is shorter than the external tangent, $\overline{PQ}$ intersects  $\overline{AB}$ at a point $D$ that divides  $\overline{AB}$ into parts proportional to the radii
The right triangles $\triangle APD$ and $\triangle BQD$ are similar with ratio of similarity $2:3$
Therefore, $D=(0,0), \, PD=8,$ and $QD=12$
Thus $PQ=\boxed{20}$.

The shaded area is equal to the area of the square minus the area of the four circles
Since the side length of the square is $20$ inches, the radius of the circles is $20/4 = 5$ inches
The square has area $20^2 = 400$ square inches, and each circle has area $5^2 \pi = 25\pi$ square inches, so the shaded area, in square inches, is equal to \[400 - 4 \cdot 25\pi = \boxed{400 - 100\pi}.\]

We can think of $TAB$ as the base of the pyramid, and $\overline{CT}$ as the height from apex $C$ to the base, since $\overline{CT}$ is perpendicular to face $ABT$
The area of right triangle $ABT$ is $(12)(12)/2 = 72$ square units, so the volume of the pyramid is $\frac13([ABT])(CT) = \frac13(72)(6) = 144$ cubic units.
Letting the distance from $T$ to face $ABC$ be $h$, the volume of $TABC$ can also be expressed as $\frac{h}{3}([ABC])$, so $\frac{h}{3}([ABC]) = 144$, from which we have \[h = \frac{432}{[ABC]}.\]Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangles $TAB$, $TAC$, and $TBC$, we have \begin{align*}
AB&= 12\sqrt{2},\\
AC &= BC = \sqrt{12^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{6^2(2^2 + 1^2)} = 6\sqrt{5}.
\end{align*}Therefore, $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles
Altitude $\overline{CM}$ of $\triangle ABC$ bisects $\overline{AB}$, so we have $AM = 6\sqrt{2}$
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $\triangle ACM$ gives us $CM = 6\sqrt{3}$, so \[[ABC] = \frac{(AB)(CM)}{2} = 36\sqrt{6}.\]Substituting this into our equation for $h$ above, we have \[h = \frac{432}{[ABC]} = \frac{432}{36\sqrt{6}} = \frac{36\cdot 12}{36\sqrt{6}} = \frac{12}{\sqrt{6}} = \boxed{2\sqrt{6}}.\]
Suppose we put the two circles in opposite corners of the rectangle so that the circles are tangent to the sides of the rectangle, and they are diagonally across from each other
Then the center of each circle is 3 inches in from each side of the rectangle that it touches
Now imagine a rectangle that has opposite corners at the centers of these circles
This smaller rectangle measures 8 inches by 6 inches
The diagonal of this rectangle is the greatest possible distance between the centers of the two circles
It helps if we recognize that these lengths are $3 \times 2$ and $4 \times 2$, which means we have a multiple of the 3-4-5 Pythagorean Triple
Thus, the length of the diagonal must be $5 \times 2 = \boxed{10\text{ inches}}$
Indeed, $8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100 = 10^2$

The Angle Bisector Theorem tells us that  \[\frac{BX}{AX}=\frac{BC}{AC}=\frac{27}{30}=\frac{9}{10}.\]Since $\triangle BCX$ and $\triangle ACX$ share the same height, the ratio of their areas is simply the ratio of their bases, so our answer is \[\frac{BX}{AX}=\boxed{\frac{9}{10}}.\]
The two circles described in the problem are shown in the diagram
The circle located inside $\triangle ABC$ is called the incircle; following convention we will label its center $I$
The other circle is known as an excircle, and we label its center $E$
To begin, we may compute the area of triangle $ABC$ using Heron's formula
The side lengths of triangle $\triangle ABC$ are $a=15$, $b=14$, and $c=13$, while the semiperimeter is $s=\frac{1}{2}(a+b+c)=21$, so its area is \[ K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{21\cdot 6\cdot 7\cdot 8} = 84
\]We find the inradius $r$ of $\triangle ABC$ by using the fact that $K=rs$, so $84=21r$, giving $r=4$
Next label the points of tangency of the incircle and excircle with ray $\overline{AC}$ as $S$ and $T$, as shown at right
It is a standard fact that $AS=s-a=6$ and $AT=s=21$
(The reader should confirm this
Repeatedly use the fact that tangents from a point to a circle have the same length.)  Furthermore, the angle bisector of $\angle A$ passes through $I$ and $E$, and the radii $\overline{SI}$ and $\overline{TE}$ are perpendicular to $\overline{AC}$, so triangles $\triangle ASI$ and $\triangle ATE$ are similar right triangles
By the Pythagorean Theorem we compute \[ AI = \sqrt{(AS)^2+(SI)^2} = \sqrt{36+16}=2\sqrt{13}
\]Using the similar triangles we find that $AI/AE = AS/AT = 6/21 = 2/7$
Therefore $AE=7\sqrt{13}$ and we conclude that $IE=AE-AI=\boxed{5\sqrt{13}}$.

The two bases are circles, and the area of a circle is $\pi r^2$
If the area of the upper base (which is also the base of the small cone) is $25\pi$ sq cm, then its radius is $5$ cm, and the radius of the lower base is $15$ cm
The upper base, therefore, has a radius that is $\frac{1}{3}$ the size of the radius of the smaller base
Because the slope of the sides of a cone is uniform, the frustum must have been cut off $\frac{2}{3}$ of the way up the cone, so $x$ is $\frac13$ of the total height of the cone, $H$
We can now solve for $x$, because we know that the height of the frustum, $24$ cm is $\frac23$ of the total height
\begin{align*}
\frac{2}{3}H&=24\\
H&=36\\
x&=H\times\frac{1}{3}\\
x&=36\times\frac{1}{3}\\
\end{align*} Therefore, the height of the small cone is $\boxed{12}$ centimeters.
The cube has volume $4^3=64$
The pyramid has volume $\frac{1}{3}8^2h$
$$64=\frac{64}{3}h\Rightarrow h=\boxed{3}$$
An angle with measure $50\%$ larger than the measure of a right angle has measure $\frac{3}{2}\cdot 90^{\circ}=135^{\circ}$.
Thus the other two angles have a combined measure of $45^{\circ}$
Each one has a measure of
$$\frac{45^{\circ}}{2}=\boxed{22.5^{\circ}}.$$

Three-inch cubes can fill a rectangular box only if the edge lengths of the box are all integer multiples of 3 inches
The largest such box whose dimensions are less than or equal to those of the $6''\times5''\times10''$ box is a $6''\times3''\times9''$ box
The ratio of the volumes of these two boxes is  \[
\frac{6\cdot3\cdot9}{6\cdot5\cdot10}=\frac{3\cdot9}{5\cdot10}=\frac{27}{50},
\] which is $\boxed{54}$ percent.
Consider a cross-section of the cone that passes through the apex of the cone and the center of the circular base
It looks as follows: [asy] defaultpen(linewidth(1) + fontsize(10)); size(120); pen dashes = linetype("2 2") + linewidth(1); real r = 6*5^.5 - 6;
pair A = (0,-24), O = (0,0), C = (0,-r), P = foot(C,(12,0),A); draw(circle(C,r)); draw((-12,0)--A--(12,0)--cycle); draw(O--A, dashes); dot(C); draw(C--P,dashes); draw(rightanglemark(C,P,A));
label("$A$",A,S); label("$B$",(-12,0),N); label("$C$",(12,0),N); label("$D$",O,N); label("$O$",C,W); label("$P$",P,SE);
[/asy] Let $O$ be the center of the sphere (or the center of the circle in the cross-section), let the triangle be $\triangle ABC$, so that $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and $A$ is the apex (as $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, then $\overline{AD}$ is an altitude)
Let $P$ be the point of tangency of the circle with $\overline{AC}$, so that $OP \perp AC$
It follows that $\triangle AOP \sim \triangle ACD$
Let $r$ be the radius of the circle
It follows that $$\frac{OP}{AO} = \frac{CD}{AC} \implies OP \cdot AC = AO \cdot CD.$$We know that $CD = 12$, $AC = \sqrt{12^2 + 24^2} = 12\sqrt{5}$, $OP = r$, and $AO = AD - OP = 24 - r$
Thus, $$12r\sqrt{5} = 12(24-r) = 12^2 \cdot 2 - 12r \implies 12r(1 + \sqrt{5}) = 12^2 \cdot 2.$$Thus, $r = \frac{24}{1+\sqrt{5}}$
Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate, we find that $$r = \frac{24}{1+\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{\sqrt{5} - 1} = \frac{24(\sqrt{5} - 1)}{5 - 1} = 6\sqrt{5} - 6.$$It follows that $a+c = \boxed{11}$.
Since $QA$ is perpendicular to $QC$, we can treat $QC$ as the height of $\triangle QCA$ and $QA$ as the base
The area of $\triangle QCA$ is $$\frac{1}{2}\times QA\times QC=\frac{1}{2}\times(2-0)\times(12-p)=\frac{1}{2}\times2\times (12-p)=\boxed{12-p}.$$
Join the centre of each circle to the centre of the other two

Since each of these line segments have equal length, then the triangle that they form is equilateral, and so each of its angles is equal to $60^\circ$.
Now, the perimeter of the shaded region is equal to the sum of the lengths of the three circular arcs which enclose it
Each of these arcs is the arc of one of the circles between the points where this circle touches the other two circles.
Thus, each arc is a $60^\circ$ arc of one of the circles (since the radii joining either end of each arc to the centre of its circle form an angle of $60^\circ$), so each arc is $\frac{60^\circ}{360^\circ} = \frac{1}{6}$ of the total circumference of the circle, so each arc has length $\frac{1}{6}(36)=6$.
Therefore, the perimeter of the shaded region is $3(6) = \boxed{18}$.
Since $AB=AC$, triangle $ABC$ must be an isosceles triangle and the measures of $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ACB$ must be equal
Continuing, since $\overline{BD}$ bisects angle $ABC$, we have that the measures of $\angle ABD$ and $\angle BDC$ are equal
Finally, since $BD=BC$, triangle $BDC$ must also be an isosceles triangle so the measures of $\angle BDC = \angle BCD$
Now if we consider triangle $BDC$, we know that angles $BDC$ and $BCD$ have equal angle measures and angle $DBC$ has an angle measure that is half that of the other two
Since these three angle measures must add up to $180^\circ$, we have that $\angle DBC$ has measure $36^\circ$ and angles $BDC$ and $BCD$ have measures $72 ^\circ$.
Now, since $\angle ABC \cong \angle ACB$ and $\angle ACB$ has measure $72^\circ$, we know that $\angle A$ must have an angle measure of $180-72-72=\boxed{36}$ degrees.
The Angle Bisector Theorem tells us that  \[\frac{AC}{AX}=\frac{BC}{BX}\]so \[AX=\frac{AC\cdot BX}{BC}=\frac{21\cdot28}{30}=\frac{7^2\cdot3\cdot4}{30}=\frac{7^2\cdot2}{5}=\boxed{\frac{98}5}.\]

Triangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \frac{1}{2}$ and $PD = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(-\frac12,-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$, so $\sin240^\circ = \boxed{-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.
The coordinates of point $B$ are $(-x,6)$
The sum of all four coordinates is $x+6+(-x)+6=\boxed{12}$.
Let the dimensions of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$
We are given $2l+2w=144$, which implies $l+w=72$
Solving for $w$, we have $w=72-l$
The area of the rectangle is $lw=l(72-l)$
As a function of $l$, this expression is a parabola whose zeros are at $l=0$ and $l=72$ (see graph)
The $y$-coordinate of a point on the parabola is maximized when the $x$-coordinate is chosen as close to the $x$-coordinate of the vertex as possible
The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the zeros at $x=(0+72)/2=36$, so the maximum area is $(36)(36)=1296$ square units
Similarly, to minimize the area we choose the length to be as far from $36$ as possible
The resulting dimensions are $1$ unit and $71$ units, so the minimum area is 71 square units
The difference between 1296 square units and 71 square units is $\boxed{1225}$ square units.

Triangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $DP = \frac12$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\frac12\right)$, so $\cos 210^\circ = \boxed{-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.
The lateral area of a cylinder is $2\pi rh$
Since $h = 5$ and $r = 2$, our answer is $2\pi\cdot 2\cdot 5 = \boxed{20\pi}$.
Solving $\frac{1}{3}\pi(12\text{ cm})^2(h)=432\pi\text{ cm}^3$, we find that the height $h$ of the cone is 9 cm
Since the radius is 12 cm and the height is 9 cm, the slant height of the cone, which is the same as the distance from $B$ to $C$, is $\sqrt{9^2+12^2}=15$ centimeters
The length of major arc $AC$ is equal to the circumference of the cone, which is $2\pi(12\text{ cm})=24\pi$ cm
The distance all the way around the circle is $2\pi(BC)=30\pi$ cm
Therefore, the central angle of major arc $AC$ measures $\left(\frac{24\pi\text{ cm}}{30\pi\text{ cm}}\right)360^\circ=288$ degrees
The measure of angle $ABC$ is $360^\circ-288^\circ=\boxed{72}$ degrees.

Since $\overline{PA}$ is perpendicular to both $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AD}$, the segment $\overline{PA}$ is the altitude from the apex to the base of the pyramid
The area of the base is $[ABCD] = (AB)(BC) = 32$, and the height from the apex to the base is 6, so the volume of the pyramid is $\frac13(32)(6) = \boxed{64}$ cubic units.

Triangle $POD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, so $DO = DP = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$, so $\tan 225^\circ = \frac{\sin 225^\circ}{\cos 225^\circ} = \frac{-\sqrt{2}/2}{-\sqrt{2}/2} = \boxed{1}$.
We create a right triangle with the slant height as the hypotenuse, the height from the vertex to the center of the base as one of the legs, and a radius as the other leg
By Pythagorean theorem, the radius measures $\sqrt{13^2-12^2}=5$ cm
It follows that the volume of the cone is $(1/3)\pi(5^2)(12)=\boxed{100\pi}$.
Let the height of the smallest cone (the one on top) be $h$ and let the radius of the circular base of that cone be $r$
Consider the 4 cones in the diagram: the smallest one on top (cone A), the top 2 pieces (cone B), the top 3 pieces (cone C), and all 4 pieces together (cone D)
Because each piece of the large cone has the same height as the smallest cone and the same angle and vertex at the top, each of the 4 cones is a dilation of the smaller cone at the top
In other words, all four cones are similar
Because cone B has height twice that of cone A, its circular base has twice the radius as that of A
Likewise, cone C has three times the height, and thus 3 times the radius, and cone D has 4 times the height and 4 times the radius
Thus, using the formula for the volume of a cone, we get  \begin{align*}
V_B&=\frac{1}{3} \pi (2r)^2 (2h)=\frac{8}{3} \pi r^2 h \\
V_C&=\frac{1}{3} \pi (3r)^2 (3h)=\frac{27}{3} \pi r^2 h \\
V_D&=\frac{1}{3} \pi (4r)^2 (4h)=\frac{64}{3} \pi r^2 h
\end{align*}Looking at the diagram, we can see that the largest piece will be the volume of cone D minus that of cone C: \[V_{1}=\frac{64}{3} \pi r^2 h-\frac{27}{3} \pi r^2 h=\frac{64-27}{3} \pi r^2 h=\frac{37}{3} \pi r^2 h.\]Also notice that the volume of the second largest piece is the volume of cone C minus that of cone B: \[V_{2}=\frac{27}{3} \pi r^2 h-\frac{8}{3} \pi r^2 h=\frac{27-8}{3} \pi r^2 h=\frac{19}{3} \pi r^2 h.\]Thus, the ratio of the volume of the second largest piece to that of the largest piece is \begin{align*}
\frac{V_2}{V_1}=\frac{\frac{19}{3} \pi r^2 h}{\frac{37}{3} \pi r^2 h}
=\frac{\frac{19}{\cancel{3}} \cancel{\pi} \cancel{r^2} \cancel{h}}{\frac{37}{\cancel{3}} \cancel{\pi} \cancel{r^2} \cancel{h}}
=\boxed{\frac{19}{37}}.

By symmetry, $\angle AOB =120^{\circ}$ and $\angle AOC = 60^{\circ}$
Thus $\triangle AOC$ is a 30-60-90 degree right triangle, and $AC=1$, so \[
OC= \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}AC= \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]If $OD$ is a radius of the large circle through $C$, then \[
OD=CD + OC= 1 + \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}= \boxed{\frac{3+2\sqrt{3}}{3}}.
The total length of Bonnie's wire is $12\cdot6=72$ inches, while her total volume is $6^3=216$ cubic inches
Each of Roark's unit cubes has volume $1$ cubic inch, so he needs $216$ cubes.
Since each cube has $12$ edges, each of Roark's cubes has $12\cdot1=12$ inches of wire
So his $216$ cubes have a total of $216\cdot12$ inches of wire.
So the desired fraction is $\dfrac{72}{216\cdot12}=\dfrac{6}{216}=\boxed{\dfrac{1}{36}}$.
Note that the unpainted region forms a parallelogram with heights between bases of 4 inches and 6 inches and with one angle 60 degree, as shown.

The right triangle formed by drawing the height shown is a 30-60-90 triangle, and hence the hypotenuse has length $\frac{6}{\sqrt{3}/2} = 4\sqrt{3}$ inches
Now considering the hypotenuse as the base of the paralleogram, our new height is 4, and thus the area of this parallelogram is $4\cdot 4\sqrt{3} = \boxed{16\sqrt{3}}$.
The volume of a cone is $\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h$
We're given that the volume is $12\pi$ and the height is $4$
Thus, $\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 \cdot 4 = 12\pi$
Solving for $r$, we find $r = 3$
Therefore, the circumference of the base is $2\pi r = \boxed{6\pi}$.
To begin with, let $DF = x$ and $FA = 9 - x$
$\triangle{DFA}$ is a right triangle, so we can solve for $x$ by applying the Pythagorean Theorem: $x^2 + 9 = 81 - 18x + x^2$, so $18x = 72$, or $x = 4$
By applying the same argument to $\triangle{EAB}$, we can see that $FA = EA = 5$
Drop a perpendicular from $F$ to $EA$ and call the intersection point $P$
$PFDA$ is a rectangle, so we know that $PA = FD = 4$, so $PE = 5 - 4 = 1$
Furthermore, we know that $FP = DA = 3$
Now, we have right triangle $\triangle{FPE}$ with legs $1$ and $3$, so we can solve for $FE$ by applying the Pythagorean Theorem: $FE = \sqrt{1+9} = \boxed{\sqrt{10}}$.
First of all, for our benefit, we should draw in the desired angle: [asy]

[/asy] We can see that $AB = BC = EB,$ thus $\triangle ABE$ is an isosceles triangle, where $\angle ABE = 90^\circ + 60^\circ = 150^\circ.$ Since the other two angles are equal and add up to $30^\circ$, we have that $\angle BAE = 15^\circ.$ Likewise, $\angle CAD = 15^\circ.$
Then, $\angle DAE = \angle CAB - \angle CAD - \angle BAE = 60^\circ - 15^\circ - 15^\circ = \boxed{30^\circ.}$

[/asy] $\triangle ACE$ and $\triangle BCD$ are similar by AA since they share $\angle ACB$ and $\angle AEC$ and $\angle BDC$ are both right angles and hence congruent
So $$\frac{CE}{CD} = \frac{AC}{BC}.$$ Plugging in values, we have $$\frac23 = \frac{8}{x+2}.$$ Solving this gives $x+2 = 12,$ or $x = \boxed{10}.$
Since $\angle C = 45^\circ$, triangle $ACD$ is a $45^\circ$-$45^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle, which means $AD = CD = AC/\sqrt{2} = 3$
Then $BD = BC - CD = 4 - 3 = 1$.

Also, $\angle EBC = 90^\circ - \angle BCE = 45^\circ$, so triangle $BHD$ is a $45^\circ$-$45^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle
Hence, $HD = BD = 1$
Then $AH = AD - HD = 3 - 1 = 2$, so $AH:HD = \boxed{2}$.

[/asy] $\triangle SDR$ is right-angled (since $ABCD$ is a square) and isosceles, so its area (and hence the area of $\triangle BPQ$) is $\frac{1}{2}y^2$.
Similarly, the area of each of $\triangle SAP$ and $\triangle QCR$ is $\frac{1}{2}x^2$.
Therefore, the total area of the four triangles is $2(\frac{1}{2}x^2) + 2(\frac{1}{2}y^2) = x^2 + y^2$, so $x^2 + y^2 = 200$.
Now, by the Pythagorean Theorem, used first in $\triangle PRS$, then in $\triangle SAP$ and $\triangle SDR$, \begin{align*}
PR^2 & = PS^2 + SR^2 \\
& = (SA^2 + AP^2) + (SD^2 + DR^2) \\
& = 2x^2 + 2y^2 \\
& = 2(200) \\
& = 400
\end{align*} so $PR = \boxed{20}$ m.
We can pick a diagonal and a leg of the trapezoid such that, along with the longer base, these lines form a triangle with sides of length 30, 40, and 50
This is a Pythagorean triple, so the triangle is a right triangle
It follows that the altitude to the longer base of the trapezoid is $30\cdot 40/50 = 24$
This altitude is the same length as the height of the trapezoid.
We now look at the right triangle formed by this altitude, the adjacent leg of the trapezoid, and part of the longer base
These three sides form a right triangle, with hypotenuse of 30 and one leg (the altitude) of length 24
It follows that the other leg has length 18.
Because this is an isosceles trapezoid, we can now calculate the shorter base to have length $50 - 2\cdot 18 = 14$
Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is $\dfrac{(50 + 14)(24)}{2} = \boxed{768}$.
The untampered bowling ball has radius $30/2=15$ cm and volume \[\frac{4}{3}\pi(15^3)=4\cdot 15^2\cdot 5\pi=225\cdot 20\pi = 4500\pi\] cubic cm
The 2 cm cylindrical holes each have radius $2/2=1$ cm and volume \[\pi (1^2)(8)=8\pi\] cubic cm; the 3 cm cylindrical hole has radius $3/2$ cm and volume \[\pi\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2(8)=9\cdot 2 \pi = 18\pi\] cubic cm
Post hole-removal the fitted ball has volume \[4500\pi - 2\cdot 8\pi - 18\pi = \boxed{4466\pi}\] cubic cm.
The given information tells us that $A = 90^\circ -B$ and $A=kB$ for some $k\ge1$
Therefore, we have $kB = 90^\circ - B$
This simplifies to $(k+1)B=90^\circ$
$k+1$ can be any factor of $90$ except one, since $k+1\ge2$
$90=2\cdot3^2\cdot5$ has $2\cdot3\cdot2=12$ factors, so there are 11 possible values of $k$
Each value of $k$ uniquely determines the value of $B$ and therefore the value of $A$, so there are $\boxed{11}$ possible measures for $A$.
The semi-circle with diameter BC has radius $\frac{1}{2}$ that of the semi-circle with diameter AB, and thus, has $\frac{1}{4}$ of the area
(Area of a circle $= \pi \times r^2$ - thus, if $r$ is half as large, that will be squared in the process)
Therefore, the sum of their areas represents $\frac{5}{8}$ of a circle with diameter AB, and since the line CP splits this area exactly in half, that area would be $\frac{5}{16}$ of a circle with diameter AB
Therefore, the degree measure of that sector is $360 \times \frac{5}{16} = \boxed{112.5}$
Since the smaller triangle has hypotenuse 5, we guess that it is a 3-4-5 triangle
Sure enough, the area of a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4 is $(3)(4)/2 = 6$, so this works
The area of the larger triangle is $150/6=25$ times the area of the smaller triangle, so its side lengths are $\sqrt{25} = 5$ times as long as the side lengths of the smaller triangle
Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle is $5(3+4) = \boxed{35}$.
Proof that the only possibility for the smaller triangle is that it is a 3-4-5 triangle: Let's call the legs of the smaller triangle $a$ and $b$ (with $b$ being the longer leg) and the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle $c$
Similarly, let's call the corresponding legs of the larger triangle $A$ and $B$ and the hypotenuse of the larger triangle $C$
Since the area of the smaller triangle is 6 square inches, we can say  $$\frac{1}{2}ab=6.$$ Additionally, we are told that the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches, so $c=5$ and $$a^2+b^2=25.$$ Because $\frac{1}{2}ab=6$, we get $ab=12$ or $a=\frac{12}{b}$
We can now write the equation in terms of $b$
We get \begin{align*}
a^2+b^2&=25\\
\left(\frac{12}{b}\right)^{2}+b^2&=25\\
12^2+b^4&=25b^2\\
b^4-25b^2+144&=0.
\end{align*} Solving for $b$, we get  $$b^4-25b^2+144=(b-4)(b+4)(b-3)(b+3)=0.$$ Since we said that $b$ is the longer of the two legs, $b=4$ and $a=3$
Therefore, the triangle must be a 3-4-5 right triangle.
The area of a triangle is given by the formula $\frac 12 bh$
Both $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle ADC$ share the same height $AB$
Let $[ABD]$ be the area of $\triangle ABD$ and $[ADC]$ be the area of $\triangle ADC$
It follows that $\frac{[ABD]}{[ADC]} = \frac{\frac 12 \cdot BD \cdot h}{\frac 12 \cdot DC \cdot h} = \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{4}{3}$
Thus, $[ADC] = \frac 34 [ABD] = \frac 34 \cdot 24 = \boxed{18}$.
Plotting the given points in a coordinate plane, we find that the triangle is a right triangle whose legs have length $5-(-2)=7$ and $10-5=5$ units
The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(\text{base})(\text{height})=\frac{1}{2}(7)(5)=\boxed{17.5}$ square units.

The cylinder has volume $\pi (12)^2 (24)$ cubic cm
Each cone has volume $(1/3)\pi (12)^2(12)$ cubic cm
Hence the volume of the space in the cylinder not occupied by the cones is  \begin{align*}
\pi (12)^2 (24) - (2)(1/3)\pi (12)^2(12) &= 12^3\pi(2-2/3)\\

Triangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $DP = \frac12$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac12\right)$, so $\sin 150^\circ = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
By the triangle inequality, \begin{align*}
x + 13 &> 37, \\
x + 37 &> 13, \\
13 + 37 &> x,
\end{align*} which tell us that $x > 24$, $x > -24$, and $x < 50$
Hence, the possible values of $x$ are $25, 26, \dots, 49$, for a total of $49 - 25 + 1 = \boxed{25}$.
From right triangle $ABD$, we have $\sin A = \frac{BD}{AB} = \frac{BD}{24}$
Since $\sin A = \frac23$, we have $\frac23 = \frac{BD}{24}$, so $BD = \frac23\cdot 24 = 16$.
From right triangle $BCD$, we have $\sin C = \frac{BD}{BC}=\frac{16}{BC}$
Since $\sin C = \frac13$, we have $\frac{16}{BC} = \frac13$
Therefore, we have $BC = 3\cdot 16=48$
Finally, the Pythagorean Theorem gives us \begin{align*}
CD &= \sqrt{BC^2 - BD^2}\\
&= \sqrt{48^2 - 16^2} \\
&= \sqrt{(3\cdot 16)^2 - 16^2} \\
&= \sqrt{9\cdot 16^2 - 16^2} = \sqrt{8\cdot 16^2} = 2\cdot 16 \sqrt{2} = \boxed{32\sqrt{2}}.\end{align*}
A full circle with radius 18 has circumference $2(\pi)(18)=36\pi$, so a 300-degree sector has arc length (shown in blue below) \[\frac{300^\circ}{360^\circ}\cdot 36\pi = 30\pi.\][asy]

Let the cone that is formed have height $h$ and radius $r$
Thus we have \[2\pi r = 30\pi\]and \[r^2+h^2=18^2\]From the first equation we have $r=15$; from the second equation we have $h=\sqrt{18^2-15^2}=\sqrt{99}=3\sqrt{11}$.
Finally, the desired volume is \[\frac{1}{3}r^2h\pi = \frac{1}{3}(15^2)(3\sqrt{11})\pi = {225\pi\sqrt{11}}.\]So, dividing the volume by $\pi$ gives $\boxed{225\sqrt{11}}$.

Since $\angle A = 60^\circ$, we have $\angle B = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 60^\circ = 30^\circ$
Then $\triangle ABC$ is a $30 - 60 - 90$ triangle, so $BC=AC\sqrt{3}=10\sqrt{3}$ and $AB=2AC=20$
We can compute the area of $\triangle ABC$ as \[ [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2}(AC)(BC)=\frac{1}{2}(10)(10\sqrt{3}) = 50\sqrt{3}.\]Let the incircle of $\triangle ABC$ have radius $r$
A triangle with inradius $r$ and semiperimeter $s$ has \[\text{area} = rs,\]so we have  \[ [\triangle ABC] = r \left( \frac{10+10\sqrt{3}+20}{2} \right) = r(15+5\sqrt{3}).\]Setting these two area expressions equal gives \[50\sqrt{3}=r(15+5\sqrt{3}).\]Solving for $r$ gives  \[r = \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{3+\sqrt{3}} = \frac{10\sqrt{3}(3-\sqrt{3})}{9-3} = \boxed{5(\sqrt{3}-1)}.\]

Then by the triangle inequality, \begin{align*}

Therefore, $\triangle XYZ$ is a 3-4-5 triangle
Since the hypotenuse has length $30 = 5\cdot 6$, the legs have lengths $XZ = 3\cdot 6 = 18$ and $XY = 4\cdot 6 = \boxed{24}$.

We have $\tan R = \frac{PQ}{PR}$ and $\sin R = \frac{PQ}{RQ} = \frac{PQ}{20}$, so $\tan R = 4\sin R$ gives us $\frac{PQ}{PR} = 4\cdot \frac{PQ}{20} = \frac{PQ}{5}$
From $\frac{PQ}{PR} = \frac{PQ}{5}$, we have $PR = \boxed{5}$.
Let $n-d$, $n$, and $n+d$ be the angles in the triangle
Then \[
180 = n-d+n+n+d= 3n, \quad \text{so} \quad n=60.
\] Because the sum of the degree measures of two angles of a triangle is less than 180, we have $$180 > n + (n+d) = 120 + d,$$ which implies that $0<d<60$.
There are $\boxed{59}$ triangles   with this property.
The tetrahedron is shown below
In order to find $\cos \angle AMB$, we build a right triangle with $\angle AMB$ among its angles
The foot of the altitude from $A$ to face $BCD$ is the centroid, $G$, of triangle $BCD$.

Since $\overline{BM}$ is a median of $\triangle BCD$, point $G$ is on $\overline{BM}$ such that $GM = \frac13BM$
Furthermore, we have $AM = BM$, so  \[\cos \angle AMB= \cos \angle AMG = \frac{GM}{AM} = \frac{(BM/3)}{BM}=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}.\]

Let $F$ be the center of the square base and $M$ be the midpoint of an edge of the square, as shown
There are four triangular faces, each with area half the area of the square face
So, the total surface area of the pyramid is 3 times the area of the square face
Therefore, the area of the square face is $432/3=144$ square units, which means that each side of the square has length 12.
Since the area of the triangle is half the area of the square, we have $(BC)(PM)/2 = 72$, so $(BC)(PM) = 144$, which means $PM = 144/12 = 12$
Since $F$ is the center of the square base, we have $FM = 6$, so $PF = \sqrt{12^2 - 6^2} = 6\sqrt{3}$
Finally, the volume of the pyramid is \[\frac{[ABCD]\cdot PF}{3} = \frac{144\cdot 6\sqrt{3}}{3} = \boxed{288\sqrt{3}}.\]

[/asy] We have made $AB = AC = 10$ and $BC = 12.$ We can notice a few useful things
Since $ABC$ is isosceles, it follows that $AD$ is an altitude as well as a median, which is useful for finding lengths, since it means we can use the Pythagorean Theorem
At this point, we can drop additional segments from $E$ and $F$ perpendicular to $BC,$ meeting $BC$ at $G$ and $H,$ respectively: [asy]

[/asy] Since $DC = 6$ and $AC = 10,$ we have a $3:4:5$ Pythagorean triple and $AD = 8$
Since $\triangle BFH \sim \triangle BAD$ and $BF = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB$ (since F is the midpoint of AB), we can see that $FH = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD = 4$ and $BH = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BD = \frac{1}{4} \cdot BC = 3.$ $HC = BC - BH = 12 - 3 = 9.$
To find $CF^2,$ we simply use the Pythagorean Theorem: $CF^2 = FH^2 + HC^2 = 16 + 81 = 97.$ By symmetry, we can see that $BE^2 = 97.$ From before, we have that $AD^2 = 8^2 = 64.$ Our answer is therefore $AD^2 + BE^2 + CF^2 = 64 + 97 + 97 = \boxed{258}.$
In a triangle, the lengths of any two sides must add up to a value larger than the third length's side
This is known as the Triangle Inequality
Keeping this in mind, we list out cases based on the length of the shortest side.
Case 1:  shortest side has length $1$
Then the other two sides must have lengths $7$ and $7$
This leads to the set $\{1,7,7\}$.
Case 2:  shortest side has length $2$
Then the other two sides must have lengths $6$ and $7$
This leads to the set $\{2,6,7\}$.
Case 3:  shortest side has length $3$
Then the other two sides can have lengths $6$ and $6$ or $5$ and $7$
This leads to the sets $\{3,6,6\}$ and $\{3,5,7\}$.
Case 4:  shortest side has length $4$
Then the other two sides can have lengths $5$ and $6$ or $4$ and $7$
This leads to the sets $\{4,5,6\}$ and $\{4,4,7\}$.
Case 5:  shortest side has length $5$
Then the other two sides must have lengths $5$ and $5$
This leads to the set $\{5,5,5\}$.
Hence there are $\boxed{7}$ sets of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of $15$ units.
Triangle $ACD$ is an isosceles triangle with a $60^\circ$ angle, so it is also equilateral
Therefore, the length of $\overline{AC}$ is $\boxed{17}$.
Shrinking the triangle by dividing every side length by 2, we recognize the resulting set $$\{7,24,25\}$$ of side lengths as a Pythagorean triple
Therefore, the original triangle is also a right triangle, and its legs measure 14 cm and 48 cm
The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(14\text{ cm})(48\text{ cm})=\boxed{336}$ square centimeters.
Let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $E$ to $\overline{DC}$
Since $ CD= AB = 5$, $FG= 2$, and $ \triangle FEG$ is similar to $\triangle AEB$, we have \[\frac{EH}{EH+3} =\frac{2}{5},\quad \text{so} \quad 5EH =2EH + 6,\]and $EH = 2$
Hence \[[\triangle AEB] = \frac{1}{2}(2 + 3)\cdot 5 = \boxed{\frac{25}{2}}.\][asy]

In Crate A, we have 20 rows of 10 pipes packed directly on top of each other
So the height of the packing is 20 times the diameter of a single pipe, or 200 cm
In Crate B, draw a horizontal line through the centers of the 9 or 10 pipes in each row
By symmetry, the distance between each consecutive pair of these 21 lines will be the same, say equal to $d$
There will be 20 such distances.

The two large semicircles together make a circle of radius 5, which has area $25\pi$
The two small circles together make a circle with radius 3, which has area $9\pi$
Therefore, the ratio of the large semicircles' area to the small semicircles' area is $\frac{25\pi}{9\pi} = \frac{25}{9} \approx 2.78$
Since the large semicircles have area 2.78 times the small semicircles, the large semicircles' area is $278\%$ of the small semicircles' area, which is an increase of $278\% - 100\% = \boxed{178\%}$ over the small semicircles' area.
Line $AC$ has slope $-\frac{1}{2}$ and $y$-intercept (0,9), so its equation is \[
y=-\frac{1}{2}x+9.
\]Since the coordinates of $A'$ satisfy both this equation and $y=x$, it follows that $A'=(6,6)$
Similarly, line $BC$ has equation $y=-2x+12$, and $B'=(4,4)$
Thus \[
A'B'= \sqrt{(6-4)^{2}+(6-4)^{2}}= \boxed{2\sqrt{2}}.

Since $\overline{AG}$ is a space diagonal of the cube, we have $AG = CG\cdot\sqrt{3}$
Therefore, considering right triangle $AGC$ gives us \[\sin\angle GAC = \frac{CG}{AG} = \frac{CG}{(\sqrt{3})(CG)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}}.\]
We look at $\angle ABC$
$\angle ABC$ cuts off minor arc $\widehat{AC}$, which has measure $2\cdot m\angle ABC = 150^\circ$, so minor arcs $\widehat{AB}$ and $\widehat{BC}$ each have measure $\frac{360^\circ-150^\circ}{2}=105^\circ$.
Stuart cuts off one $105^\circ$ minor arc with each segment he draws
By the time Stuart comes all the way around to his starting point and has drawn, say, $n$ segments, he will have created $n$ $105^\circ$ minor arcs which can be pieced together to form a whole number of full circles, say, $m$ circles
Let there be $m$ full circles with total arc measure $360^\circ \cdot m$
Then we have \[105^\circ \cdot n = 360^\circ \cdot m.\]  We want to find the smallest integer $n$ for which there is an integer solution $m$
Dividing both sides of the equation by $15^\circ$ gives $7n=24m$; thus, we see $n=24$ works (in which case $m=7$)
The answer is $\boxed{24}$ segments.
$\overline{DF}\|\overline{BE}$ and $\overline{DB}\|\overline{FE}$ by the midline theorem and $\angle DBE$ is right, so $DFEB$ is a rectangle
$2BE=BC=AB=2DB$, so $BE=DB$ and $DFEB$ is a square
Say it has side length $2x$; $AB=BC=4x$ and $FG=FH=x$
$\triangle ABC$ has area $\frac{(4x)(4x)}{2}=8x^2$, $\triangle FGH$ has area $\frac{x^2}{2}$, and $\triangle DBE$ has area $\frac{4x^2}{2}=2x^2$
The shaded area is thus $2x^2+\frac{x^2}{2}=\frac{5x^2}{2}$, and the non-shaded area is $8x^2-\frac{5x^2}{2}=\frac{11x^2}{2}$
Therefore, the ratio of shaded to nonshaded area is \[
\frac{\frac{5x^2}{2}}{\frac{11x^2}{2}}=\frac{5x^2}{11x^2}=\boxed{\frac{5}{11}}.
We have that $\angle P = (\text{arc } BD - \text{arc } AC)/2$ and $\angle Q = (\text{arc } AC)/2$
Hence, $\angle P + \angle Q = (\text{arc } BD)/2 = (42^\circ + 38^\circ)/2 = \boxed{40^\circ}$.
The longest segment stretches from the bottom to the top of the cylinder and across a diameter, and is thus the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is the height $8$, and the other is a diameter of length $2(3)=6$
Thus its length is
$$\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=\boxed{10}$$
If we let the side of length $2s$ be the base of the parallelogram, we can use our 45-degree angle to find the height of the parallelogram
The height and sides of the parallelogram form a 45-45-90 triangle, with the side of length $s$ as the hypotenuse
Thus, the height of the parallelogram is $s/\sqrt{2}$.
It follows that the area of the parallelogram is $2s\cdot (s/\sqrt{2}) = s^2\sqrt{2} = 8\sqrt{2}$, so $s^2 = 8$
Taking the square root of both sides, we see that $s = \boxed{2\sqrt{2}}$.
The triangle is shown below:
pair A,B,C;
A = (0,0);
B = (10,0);
C = (10,15);

We have $\sin A = \frac{BC}{AC}$ and $\cos A = \frac{AB}{AC}$, so $2\sin A = 3\cos A$ gives us $2\cdot \frac{BC}{AC} = 3\cdot\frac{AB}{AC}$
Multiplying both sides by $AC$ gives $2BC = 3AB$, so $AB= \frac23 BC$.
The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2$
Substituting $AB = \frac23BC$ gives \[\left(\frac23BC\right)^2 + BC^2 = AC^2.\]Simplifying the left side gives $\frac{13}{9}BC^2 = AC^2$, so $\frac{BC^2}{AC^2} = \frac{9}{13}$, which means \[\sin A = \frac{BC}{AC} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{13}} = \frac{\sqrt{9}}{\sqrt{13}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{13}} = \boxed{\frac{3\sqrt{13}}{13}}.\]We also could have noted that $(\sin A)^2 + (\cos A)^2 = 1$ for any angle $A$, so $2\sin A = 3\cos A$ gives us $\cos A = \frac23 \sin A$ and $(\sin A)^2 + \left(\frac23\sin A\right)^2 = 1$, which gives $\frac{13}{9}(\sin A)^2= 1$
Therefore, we have $(\sin A)^2 = \frac{9}{13}$
Since $A$ is an acute angle, we have $\sin A > 0$, so $(\sin A)^2 = \frac{9}{13}$ gives us \[\sin A = \sqrt{\frac{9}{13}} = \frac{\sqrt{9}}{\sqrt{13}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{13}} = \boxed{\frac{3\sqrt{13}}{13}}.\]
Let the side length of $\triangle ABC$ be $s$
Then the areas of $\triangle APB$, $\triangle BPC$, and $\triangle CPA$ are, respectively, $s/2$, $s$, and $3s/2$
The area of $\triangle ABC$ is the sum of these, which is $3s$
The area of $\triangle ABC$ may also be expressed as $(\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$, so $3s = (\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$
The unique positive solution for $s$ is $\boxed{4\sqrt{3}}$.
The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the point with its image under the reflection
The slope of the segment is $\frac{5-1}{9-1}=\frac{1}{2}$
Since the line of reflection is perpendicular, its slope, $m$, equals $-2$
By the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment are $\left(\frac{9+1}2,\frac{5+1}2\right)=(5,3)$
Since the line of reflection goes through this point, we have $3=(-2)(5)+b$, and so $b=13$
Thus $m+b=-2+13=\boxed{11}.$
If the length of the base is $b$ centimeters, then the perimeter of the triangle is $5+5+b$ cm
Solving $5+5+b=17$ we find $b=\boxed{7}$.
The length of the median to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse, so the hypotenuse is $10\cdot2=20$ units long
Since the right triangle is isosceles, the length of a leg is $20/\sqrt{2}=\boxed{10\sqrt{2}}$ units.
The two angles opposite the equal sides of an isosceles triangle are congruent, so in this case, both are $40^\circ$
Since the three angles of a triangle add up to $180^\circ$, the third angle in this triangle is $(180-40-40)^\circ = \boxed{100}^\circ$.

Extend $EA$ and $FB$ to meet at $G$, and $ED$ and $FC$ to meet at $H$
Now, we have a regular tetrahedron $EFGH$, which by symmetry has twice the volume of our original solid
This tetrahedron has side length $2s = 12\sqrt{2}$
Using the formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron, which is $V = \frac{\sqrt{2}S^3}{12}$, where S is the side length of the tetrahedron, the volume of our original solid is:
$V = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot (12\sqrt{2})^3}{12} = \boxed{288}$.
Let $QP=PR=x$
Angles $QPA$, $APB$, and $BPR$ must add up to $180^{\circ}$
By the Law of Cosines, $\angle APB=\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{{-11}}{24}\right)$
Also, angles $QPA$ and $BPR$ equal $\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{16}\right)$ and $\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{12}\right)$
So we have
$\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{16}\right)+\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{{-11}}{24}\right)=180^{\circ}-\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{12}\right).$
Taking the cosine of both sides, and simplifying using the addition formula for $\cos$ as well as the identity $\sin^{2}{x} + \cos^{2}{x} = 1$, gives $x^2=\boxed{130}$.
Firstly, we note the statement in the problem that "$AD$ is the only chord starting at $A$ and bisected by $BC$" – what is its significance? What is the criterion for this statement to be true?
We consider the locus of midpoints of the chords from $A$
It is well-known that this is the circle with diameter $AO$, where $O$ is the center of the circle
The proof is simple: every midpoint of a chord is a dilation of the endpoint with scale factor $\frac{1}{2}$ and center $A$
Thus, the locus is the result of the dilation with scale factor $\frac{1}{2}$ and centre $A$ of circle $O$
Let the center of this circle be $P$.
Now, $AD$ is bisected by $BC$ if they cross at some point $N$ on the circle
Moreover, since $AD$ is the only chord, $BC$ must be tangent to the circle $P$.
The rest of this problem is straightforward.
Our goal is to find $\sin \angle AOB = \sin{\left(\angle AOM - \angle BOM\right)}$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$
We have $BM=3$ and $OM=4$
Let $R$ be the projection of $A$ onto $OM$, and similarly let $Q$ be the projection of $P$ onto $OM$
Then it remains to find $AR$ so that we can use the addition formula for $\sin$.
As $PN$ is a radius of circle $P$, $PN=2.5$, and similarly, $PO=2.5$
Since $OM=4$, we have $OQ=OM-QM=OM-PN=4-2.5=1.5$
Thus $PQ=\sqrt{2.5^2-1.5^2}=2$.
Further, we see that $\triangle OAR$ is a dilation of $\triangle OPQ$ about center $O$ with scale factor $2$, so $AR=2PQ=4$.
Lastly, we apply the formula:\[\sin{\left(\angle AOM - \angle BOM\right)} = \sin \angle AOM \cos \angle BOM - \sin \angle BOM \cos \angle AOM = \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)-\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)=\frac{7}{25}\]Thus the answer is $7\cdot25=\boxed{175}$.
We use coordinates
Let the circle have center $(0,0)$ and radius $\sqrt{50}$; this circle has equation $x^2 + y^2 = 50$
Let the coordinates of $B$ be $(a,b)$
We want to find $a^2 + b^2$
$A$ and $C$ with coordinates $(a,b+6)$ and $(a+2,b)$, respectively, both lie on the circle
From this we obtain the system of equations
$a^2 + (b+6)^2 = 50$
$(a+2)^2 + b^2 = 50$
Solving, we get $a=5$ and $b=-1$, so the distance is $a^2 + b^2 = \boxed{26}$.
By the transversals that go through $P$, all four triangles are similar to each other by the $AA$ postulate
Also, note that the length of any one side of the larger triangle is equal to the sum of the sides of each of the corresponding sides on the smaller triangles
We use the identity $K = \dfrac{ab\sin C}{2}$ to show that the areas are proportional (the sides are proportional and the angles are equal) Hence, we can write the lengths of corresponding sides of the triangle as $2x,\ 3x,\ 7x$
Thus, the corresponding side on the large triangle is $12x$, and the area of the triangle is $12^2 = \boxed{144}$.
First of all, we can translate everything downwards by $76$ and to the left by $14$
Then, note that a line passing through a given point intersecting a circle with a center as that given point will always cut the circle in half, so we can re-phrase the problem:
Two circles, each of radius $3$, are drawn with centers at $(0, 16)$, and $(5, 8)$
A line passing through $(3,0)$ is such that the total area of the parts of the three circles to one side of the line is equal to the total area of the parts of the three circles to the other side of it
What is the absolute value of the slope of this line?
Note that this is equivalent to finding a line such that the distance from $(0,16)$ to the line is the same as the distance from $(5,8)$ to the line
Let the line be $y - ax - b = 0$
Then, we have that:\[\frac{|-5a + 8 - b|}{\sqrt{a^2+1}}= \frac{|16 - b|}{\sqrt{a^2+1}} \Longleftrightarrow |-5a+8-b| = |16-b|\]We can split this into two cases.
Case 1: $16-b = -5a + 8 - b \Longleftrightarrow a = -\frac{8}{5}$
In this case, the absolute value of the slope of the line won’t be an integer, and since this is an AIME problem, we know it’s not possible.
Case 2: $b-16 = -5a + 8 - b \Longleftrightarrow 2b + 5a = 24$
But we also know that it passes through the point $(3,0)$, so $-3a-b = 0 \Longleftrightarrow b = -3a$
Plugging this in, we see that $2b + 5a = 24 \Longleftrightarrow a = -24$
$\boxed{24}$.
It is clear that $DX=8$ and $CX=10$ where $X$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ and $C$ to side $AB$
Thus $[DXC]=\frac{ab\sin{c}}{2}=20=5 \cdot h \rightarrow h = 4$ where h is the height of the tetrahedron from $D$
Hence, the volume of the tetrahedron is $\frac{bh}{3}=15\cdot \frac{4}{3}=\boxed{20}$.
Let one leg of the triangle have length $a$ and let the other leg have length $b$
When we rotate around the leg of length $a$, the result is a cone of height $a$ and radius $b$, and so of volume $\frac 13 \pi ab^2 = 800\pi$
Likewise, when we rotate around the leg of length $b$ we get a cone of height $b$ and radius $a$ and so of volume $\frac13 \pi b a^2 = 1920 \pi$
If we divide this equation by the previous one, we get $\frac ab = \frac{\frac13 \pi b a^2}{\frac 13 \pi ab^2} = \frac{1920}{800} = \frac{12}{5}$, so $a = \frac{12}{5}b$
Then $\frac{1}{3} \pi \left(\frac{12}{5}b\right)b^2 = 800\pi$ so $b^3 = 1000$ and $b = 10$ so $a = 24$
Then by the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse has length $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \boxed{26}$.

It’s easy to see in triangle which lengths 2, 3, and 4, that the angle opposite the side 2 is $\frac{\alpha}{2}$, and using the Law of Cosines, we get:\[2^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 - 2\cdot3\cdot4\cos\frac{\alpha}{2}\]Which, rearranges to:\[21 = 24\cos\frac{\alpha}{2}\]And, that gets us:\[\cos\frac{\alpha}{2} = 7/8\]Using $\cos 2\theta = 2\cos^2 \theta - 1$, we get that:\[\cos\alpha = 17/32\]Which gives an answer of $\boxed{49}$.
We first find the length of line segment $FG$
Since $DC$ has length $6$ and $DF$ and $GC$ have lengths $1$ and $2$ respectively, $FG$ must have length $3$
Next, we notice that $DC$ and $AB$ are parallel so $\angle EFG \cong \angle EAB$ because they are corresponding angles
Similarly, $\angle EGF \cong \angle EBA$
Now that we have two pairs of congruent angles, we know that $\triangle FEG \sim \triangle AEB$ by Angle-Angle Similarity.
Because the two triangles are similar, we have that the ratio of the altitudes of $\triangle FEG$ to $\triangle AEB$ equals the ratio of the bases
$FG:AB=3:6=1:2$, so the the ratio of the altitude of $\triangle FEG$ to that of $\triangle AEB$ is also $1:2$
Thus, the height of the rectangle $ABCD$ must be half of the altitude of $\triangle AEB$
Since the height of rectangle $ABCD$ is $3$, the altitude of $\triangle AEB$ must be $6$
Now that we know that the base and altitude of $\triangle AEB$ are both $6$, we know that the area of triangle $AEB$ is equal to $\frac{1}{2}$base $\times$ height $= (\frac{1}{2})(6)(6) = \boxed{18}$ square units.
Translate so the medians are $y = x$, and $y = 2x$, then model the points $A: (a,a)$ and $B: (b,2b)$
$(0,0)$ is the centroid, and is the average of the vertices, so $C: (- a - b, - a - 2b)$
$AB = 60$ so
$3600 = (a - b)^2 + (2b - a)^2$
$3600 = 2a^2 + 5b^2 - 6ab \ \ \ \ (1)$
$AC$ and $BC$ are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is $-1$, giving
$\left(\frac {2a + 2b}{2a + b}\right)\left(\frac {a + 4b}{a + 2b}\right) = - 1$
$2a^2 + 5b^2 = - \frac {15}{2}ab \ \ \ \  (2)$
Combining $(1)$ and $(2)$, we get $ab = - \frac {800}{3}$
Using the determinant product for area of a triangle (this simplifies nicely, add columns 1 and 2, add rows 2 and 3), the area is $\left|\frac {3}{2}ab\right|$, so we get the answer to be $\boxed{400}$.

Let the points at which the segments hit the triangle be called $D, D', E, E', F, F'$ as shown above
As a result of the lines being parallel, all three smaller triangles and the larger triangle are similar ($\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DPD' \sim \triangle PEE' \sim \triangle F'PF$)
The remaining three sections are parallelograms.
By similar triangles, $BE'=\frac{d}{510}\cdot450=\frac{15}{17}d$ and $EC=\frac{d}{425}\cdot450=\frac{18}{17}d$
Since $FD'=BC-EE'$, we have $900-\frac{33}{17}d=d$, so $d=\boxed{306}$.
Label the point of intersection as $C$
Since $d = rt$, $AC = 8t$ and $BC = 7t$
According to the law of cosines,
[asy] pointpen=black; pathpen=black+linewidth(0.7);  pair A=(0,0),B=(10,0),C=16*expi(pi/3); D(B--A); D(A--C); D(B--C,dashed); MP("A",A,SW);MP("B",B,SE);MP("C",C,N);MP("60^{\circ}",A+(0.3,0),NE);MP("100",(A+B)/2);MP("8t",(A+C)/2,NW);MP("7t",(B+C)/2,NE); [/asy]
\begin{align*}(7t)^2 &= (8t)^2 + 100^2 - 2 \cdot 8t \cdot 100 \cdot \cos 60^\circ\\ 0 &= 15t^2 - 800t + 10000 = 3t^2 - 160t + 2000\\ t &= \frac{160 \pm \sqrt{160^2 - 4\cdot 3 \cdot 2000}}{6} = 20, \frac{100}{3}.\end{align*}
Since we are looking for the earliest possible intersection, $20$ seconds are needed
Thus, $8 \cdot 20 = \boxed{160}$ meters is the solution.
Let $\triangle{ABC}$ (or the triangle with sides $12\sqrt {3}$, $13\sqrt {3}$, $13\sqrt {3}$) be the base of our tetrahedron
We set points $C$ and $D$ as $(6\sqrt {3}, 0, 0)$ and $( - 6\sqrt {3}, 0, 0)$, respectively
Using Pythagoras, we find $A$ as $(0, \sqrt {399}, 0)$
We know that the vertex of the tetrahedron ($P$) has to be of the form $(x, y, z)$, where $z$ is the altitude of the tetrahedron
Since the distance from $P$ to points $A$, $B$, and $C$ is $\frac {\sqrt {939}}{2}$, we can write three equations using the distance formula:
\begin{align*} x^{2} + (y - \sqrt {399})^{2} + z^{2} &= \frac {939}{4}\\ (x - 6\sqrt {3})^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} &= \frac {939}{4}\\ (x + 6\sqrt {3})^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} &= \frac {939}{4} \end{align*}
Subtracting the last two equations, we get $x = 0$
Solving for $y,z$ with a bit of effort, we eventually get $x = 0$, $y = \frac {291}{2\sqrt {399}}$, $z = \frac {99}{\sqrt {133}}$
Since the area of a triangle is $\frac {1}{2}\cdot bh$, we have the base area as $18\sqrt {133}$
Thus, the volume is $V = \frac {1}{3}\cdot18\sqrt {133}\cdot\frac {99}{\sqrt {133}} = 6\cdot99 = \boxed{594}$.
The formula for the interior angle of a regular sided polygon is $\frac{(n-2)180}{n}$.
Thus, $\frac{\frac{(r-2)180}{r}}{\frac{(s-2)180}{s}} = \frac{59}{58}$
Cross multiplying and simplifying, we get $\frac{58(r-2)}{r} = \frac{59(s-2)}{s}$
Cross multiply and combine like terms again to yield $58rs - 58 \cdot 2s = 59rs - 59 \cdot 2r \Longrightarrow 118r - 116s = rs$
Solving for $r$, we get $r = \frac{116s}{118 - s}$.
$r \ge 0$ and $s \ge 0$, making the numerator of the fraction positive
To make the denominator positive, $s < 118$; the largest possible value of $s$ is $117$.
This is achievable because the denominator is $1$, making $r$ a positive number $116 \cdot 117$ and $s = \boxed{117}$.

Use the angle bisector theorem to find that the angle bisector of $\angle P$ divides $QR$ into segments of length $\frac{25}{x} = \frac{15}{20 -x} \Longrightarrow x = \frac{25}{2},\ \frac{15}{2}$
It follows that $\frac{QP'}{RP'} = \frac{5}{3}$, and so $P' = \left(\frac{5x_R + 3x_Q}{8},\frac{5y_R + 3y_Q}{8}\right) = (-5,-23/2)$.
The desired answer is the equation of the line $PP'$
$PP'$ has slope $\frac{-11}{2}$, from which we find the equation to be $11x + 2y + 78 = 0$
Therefore, $a+c = \boxed{89}$.
We wish to find the radius of one circle, so that we can find the total area.
Notice that for them to contain the entire circle, each pair of circles must be tangent on the larger circle
Now consider two adjacent smaller circles
This means that the line connecting the radii is a segment of length $2r$ that is tangent to the larger circle at the midpoint of the two centers
Thus, we have essentially have a regular dodecagon whose vertices are the centers of the smaller triangles circumscribed about a circle of radius $1$.
We thus know that the apothem of the dodecagon is equal to $1$
To find the side length, we make a triangle consisting of a vertex, the midpoint of a side, and the center of the dodecagon, which we denote $A, M,$ and $O$ respectively
Notice that $OM=1$, and that $\triangle OMA$ is a right triangle with hypotenuse $OA$ and $m \angle MOA = 15^\circ$
Thus $AM = (1) \tan{15^\circ} = 2 - \sqrt {3}$, which is the radius of one of the circles
The area of one circle is thus $\pi(2 - \sqrt {3})^{2} = \pi (7 - 4 \sqrt {3})$, so the area of all $12$ circles is $\pi (84 - 48 \sqrt {3})$, giving an answer of $84 + 48 + 3 = \boxed{135}$.

Let $O$ be the center of the rhombus
Via parallel sides and alternate interior angles, we see that the opposite triangles are congruent ($\triangle BPQ \cong \triangle DRS$, $\triangle APS \cong \triangle CRQ$)
Quickly we realize that $O$ is also the center of the rectangle.
By the Pythagorean Theorem, we can solve for a side of the rhombus; $PQ = \sqrt{15^2 + 20^2} = 25$
Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors, we have that $OP = 15, OQ = 20$
Also, $\angle POQ = 90^{\circ}$, so quadrilateral $BPOQ$ is cyclic
By Ptolemy's Theorem, $25 \cdot OB = 20 \cdot 15 + 15 \cdot 20 = 600$.
By similar logic, we have $APOS$ is a cyclic quadrilateral
Let $AP = x$, $AS = y$
The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $x^2 + y^2 = 625\quad \mathrm{(1)}$
Ptolemy’s Theorem gives us $25 \cdot OA = 20x + 15y$
Since the diagonals of a rectangle are equal, $OA = \frac{1}{2}d = OB$, and $20x + 15y = 600\quad \mathrm{(2)}$
Solving for $y$, we get $y = 40 - \frac 43x$
Substituting into $\mathrm{(1)}$,
\begin{eqnarray*}x^2 + \left(40-\frac 43x\right)^2 &=& 625\\ 5x^2 - 192x + 1755 &=& 0\\ x = \frac{192 \pm \sqrt{192^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 1755}}{10} &=& 15, \frac{117}{5}\end{eqnarray*}
We reject $15$ because then everything degenerates into squares, but the condition that $PR \neq QS$ gives us a contradiction
Thus $x = \frac{117}{5}$, and backwards solving gives $y = \frac{44}5$
The perimeter of $ABCD$ is $2\left(20 + 15 + \frac{117}{5} + \frac{44}5\right) = \frac{672}{5}$, and $m + n = \boxed{677}$.

Let $x=AC=BF$, $y=AD=BE$, and $z=AE=BD$.
Ptolemy's Theorem on $ABCD$ gives $81y+31\cdot 81=xz$, and Ptolemy on $ACDF$ gives $x\cdot z+81^2=y^2$
Subtracting these equations give $y^2-81y-112\cdot 81=0$, and from this $y=144$
Ptolemy on $ADEF$ gives $81y+81^2=z^2$, and from this $z=135$

The length of the diagonal is $\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5$ (a 3-4-5 right triangle)
For each $k$, $\overline{P_kQ_k}$ is the hypotenuse of a $3-4-5$ right triangle with sides of $3 \cdot \frac{168-k}{168}, 4 \cdot \frac{168-k}{168}$
Thus, its length is $5 \cdot \frac{168-k}{168}$
Let $a_k=\frac{5(168-k)}{168}$
We want to find $2\sum\limits_{k=1}^{168} a_k-5$ since we are over counting the diagonal
$2\sum\limits_{k=1}^{168} \frac{5(168-k)}{168}-5 =2\frac{(0+5)\cdot169}{2}-5 =168\cdot5 =\boxed{840}$.
Let $K_A=[BOC], K_B=[COA],$ and $K_C=[AOB].$ Due to triangles $BOC$ and $ABC$ having the same base,\[\frac{AO}{OA'}+1=\frac{AA'}{OA'}=\frac{[ABC]}{[BOC]}=\frac{K_A+K_B+K_C}{K_A}.\]Therefore, we have\[\frac{AO}{OA'}=\frac{K_B+K_C}{K_A}\]\[\frac{BO}{OB'}=\frac{K_A+K_C}{K_B}\]\[\frac{CO}{OC'}=\frac{K_A+K_B}{K_C}.\]Thus, we are given\[\frac{K_B+K_C}{K_A}+\frac{K_A+K_C}{K_B}+\frac{K_A+K_B}{K_C}=92.\]Combining and expanding gives\[\frac{K_A^2K_B+K_AK_B^2+K_A^2K_C+K_AK_C^2+K_B^2K_C+K_BK_C^2}{K_AK_BK_C}=92.\]We desire $\frac{(K_B+K_C)(K_C+K_A)(K_A+K_B)}{K_AK_BK_C}.$ Expanding this gives\[\frac{K_A^2K_B+K_AK_B^2+K_A^2K_C+K_AK_C^2+K_B^2K_C+K_BK_C^2}{K_AK_BK_C}+2=\boxed{94}.\]
Since the area $BCD=80=\frac{1}{2}\cdot10\cdot16$, the perpendicular from $D$ to $BC$ has length $16$.
The perpendicular from $D$ to $ABC$ is $16 \cdot \sin 30^\circ=8$
Therefore, the volume is $\frac{8\cdot120}{3}=\boxed{320}$.
Let $AP=x$ so that $PB=92-x.$ Extend $AD, BC$ to meet at $X,$ and note that $XP$ bisects $\angle AXB;$ let it meet $CD$ at $E.$ Using the angle bisector theorem, we let $XB=y(92-x), XA=xy$ for some $y.$
Then $XD=xy-70, XC=y(92-x)-50,$ thus\[\frac{xy-70}{y(92-x)-50} = \frac{XD}{XC} = \frac{ED}{EC}=\frac{AP}{PB} = \frac{x}{92-x},\]which we can rearrange, expand and cancel to get $120x=70\cdot 92,$ hence $AP=x=\frac{161}{3}$
This gives us a final answer of $161+3=\boxed{164}$.
The convex polyhedron of the problem can be easily visualized; it corresponds to a dodecahedron (a regular solid with $12$ equilateral pentagons) in which the $20$ vertices have all been truncated to form $20$ equilateral triangles with common vertices
The resulting solid has then $p=12$ smaller equilateral pentagons and $t=20$ equilateral triangles yielding a total of $t+p=F=32$ faces
In each vertex, $T=2$ triangles and $P=2$ pentagons are concurrent
Now, the number of edges $E$ can be obtained if we count the number of sides that each triangle and pentagon contributes: $E=\frac{3t+5p}{2}$, (the factor $2$ in the denominator is because we are counting twice each edge, since two adjacent faces share one edge)
Thus, $E=60$
Finally, using Euler's formula we have $V=E-30=30$.
In summary, the solution to the problem is $100P+10T+V=\boxed{250}$.
Consider the unit cicle of radius 50
Assume that they start at points $(-50,100)$ and $(-50,-100).$ Then at time $t$, they end up at points $(-50+t,100)$ and $(-50+3t,-100).$ The equation of the line connecting these points and the equation of the circle are\begin{align}y&=-\frac{100}{t}x+200-\frac{5000}{t}\\50^2&=x^2+y^2\end{align}.When they see each other again, the line connecting the two points will be tangent to the circle at the point $(x,y).$ Since the radius is perpendicular to the tangent we get\[-\frac{x}{y}=-\frac{100}{t}\]or $xt=100y.$ Now substitute\[y= \frac{xt}{100}\]into $(2)$ and get\[x=\frac{5000}{\sqrt{100^2+t^2}}.\]Now substitute this and\[y=\frac{xt}{100}\]into $(1)$ and solve for $t$ to get\[t=\frac{160}{3}.\]Finally, the sum of the numerator and denominator is $160+3=\boxed{163}.$

From the Pythagorean Theorem, $AH^2+CH^2=1994^2$, and $(1995-AH)^2+CH^2=1993^2$.
Subtracting those two equations yields $AH^2-(1995-AH)^2=3987$.
After simplification, we see that $2*1995AH-1995^2=3987$, or $AH=\frac{1995}{2}+\frac{3987}{2*1995}$.
Note that $AH+BH=1995$.
Therefore we have that $BH=\frac{1995}{2}-\frac{3987}{2*1995}$.
Therefore $AH-BH=\frac{3987}{1995}$.
Now note that $RS=|HR-HS|$, $RH=\frac{AH+CH-AC}{2}$, and $HS=\frac{CH+BH-BC}{2}$.
Therefore we have $RS=\left| \frac{AH+CH-AC-CH-BH+BC}{2} \right|=\frac{|AH-BH-1994+1993|}{2}$.
Plugging in $AH-BH$ and simplifying, we have $RS=\frac{1992}{1995*2}=\frac{332}{665} \rightarrow 332+665=\boxed{997}$.
Since $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle CBD$, we have $\frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{29^3}{BC} \Longrightarrow BC^2 = 29^3 AB$
It follows that $29^2 | BC$ and $29 | AB$, so $BC$ and $AB$ are in the form $29^2 x$ and $29 x^2$, respectively, where x is an integer.
By the Pythagorean Theorem, we find that $AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2 \Longrightarrow (29^2x)^2 + AC^2 = (29 x^2)^2$, so $29x | AC$
Letting $y = AC / 29x$, we obtain after dividing through by $(29x)^2$, $29^2 = x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)$
As $x,y \in \mathbb{Z}$, the pairs of factors of $29^2$ are $(1,29^2)(29,29)$; clearly $y = \frac{AC}{29x} \neq 0$, so $x-y = 1, x+y= 29^2$
Then, $x = \frac{1+29^2}{2} = 421$.
Thus, $\cos B = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{29^2 x}{29x^2} = \frac{29}{421}$, and $m+n = \boxed{450}$.
Suppose there are $n$ squares in every column of the grid, so there are $\frac{52}{24}n = \frac {13}6n$ squares in every row
Then $6|n$, and our goal is to maximize the value of $n$.
Each vertical fence has length $24$, and there are $\frac{13}{6}n - 1$ vertical fences; each horizontal fence has length $52$, and there are $n-1$ such fences
Then the total length of the internal fencing is $24\left(\frac{13n}{6}-1\right) + 52(n-1) = 104n - 76 \le 1994 \Longrightarrow n \le \frac{1035}{52} \approx 19.9$, so $n \le 19$
The largest multiple of $6$ that is $\le 19$ is $n = 18$, which we can easily verify works, and the answer is $\frac{13}{6}n^2 = \boxed{702}$.
Let $O_{AB}$ be the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors (in other words, the intersections of the creases) of $\overline{PA}$ and $\overline{PB}$, and so forth
Then $O_{AB}, O_{BC}, O_{CA}$ are, respectively, the circumcenters of $\triangle PAB, PBC, PCA$
According to the problem statement, the circumcenters of the triangles cannot lie within the interior of the respective triangles, since they are not on the paper
It follows that $\angle APB, \angle BPC, \angle CPA > 90^{\circ}$; the locus of each of the respective conditions for $P$ is the region inside the (semi)circles with diameters $\overline{AB}, \overline{BC}, \overline{CA}$.
We note that the circle with diameter $AC$ covers the entire triangle because it is the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$, so it suffices to take the intersection of the circles about $AB, BC$
We note that their intersection lies entirely within $\triangle ABC$ (the chord connecting the endpoints of the region is in fact the altitude of $\triangle ABC$ from $B$)
Thus, the area of the locus of $P$ (shaded region below) is simply the sum of two segments of the circles
If we construct the midpoints of $M_1, M_2 = \overline{AB}, \overline{BC}$ and note that $\triangle M_1BM_2 \sim \triangle ABC$, we see that thse segments respectively cut a $120^{\circ}$ arc in the circle with radius $18$ and $60^{\circ}$ arc in the circle with radius $18\sqrt{3}$.

The area of the locus is the sum of two segments of two circles; these segments cut out $120^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}$ angles by simple similarity relations and angle-chasing.
Hence, the answer is, using the $\frac 12 ab\sin C$ definition of triangle area, $\left[\frac{\pi}{3} \cdot 18^2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 18^2 \sin \frac{2\pi}{3} \right] + \left[\frac{\pi}{6} \cdot \left(18\sqrt{3}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot (18\sqrt{3})^2 \sin \frac{\pi}{3}\right] = 270\pi - 324\sqrt{3}$, and $q+r+s = \boxed{597}$.
We note that the lines partition the hexagon of the six extremal lines into disjoint unit regular triangles, and forms a series of unit regular triangles along the edge of the hexagon.

Solving the above equations for $k=\pm 10$, we see that the hexagon in question is regular, with side length $\frac{20}{\sqrt{3}}$
Then, the number of triangles within the hexagon is simply the ratio of the area of the hexagon to the area of a regular triangle
Since the ratio of the area of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their side lengths, we see that the ratio of the area of one of the six equilateral triangles composing the regular hexagon to the area of a unit regular triangle is just $\left(\frac{20/\sqrt{3}}{2/\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = 100$
Thus, the total number of unit triangles is $6 \times 100 = 600$.
There are $6 \cdot 10$ equilateral triangles formed by lines on the edges of the hexagon
Thus, our answer is $600+60 = \boxed{660}$.
Consider the points on the complex plane
The point $b+37i$ is then a rotation of $60$ degrees of $a+11i$ about the origin, so:
\[(a+11i)\left(\mathrm{cis}\,60^{\circ}\right) = (a+11i)\left(\frac 12+\frac{\sqrt{3}i}2\right)=b+37i.\]
Equating the real and imaginary parts, we have:
\begin{align*}b&=\frac{a}{2}-\frac{11\sqrt{3}}{2}\\37&=\frac{11}{2}+\frac{a\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{align*}
Solving this system, we find that $a=21\sqrt{3}, b=5\sqrt{3}$
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{315}$.
Note: There is another solution where the point $b+37i$ is a rotation of $-60$ degrees of $a+11i$; however, this triangle is just a reflection of the first triangle by the $y$-axis, and the signs of $a$ and $b$ are flipped
However, the product $ab$ is unchanged.

The angle $\theta$ is the angle formed by two perpendiculars drawn to $BO$, one on the plane determined by $OAB$ and the other by $OBC$
Let the perpendiculars from $A$ and $C$ to $\overline{OB}$ meet $\overline{OB}$ at $P.$ Without loss of generality, let $AP = 1.$ It follows that $\triangle OPA$ is a $45-45-90$ right triangle, so $OP = AP = 1,$ $OB = OA = \sqrt {2},$ and $AB = \sqrt {4 - 2\sqrt {2}}.$ Therefore, $AC = \sqrt {8 - 4\sqrt {2}}.$
From the Law of Cosines, $AC^{2} = AP^{2} + PC^{2} - 2(AP)(PC)\cos \theta,$ so
\[8 - 4\sqrt {2} = 1 + 1 - 2\cos \theta \Longrightarrow \cos \theta = - 3 + 2\sqrt {2} = - 3 + \sqrt{8}.\]
Thus $m + n = \boxed{5}$.
Let the center of the circle be $O$, and the two chords be $\overline{AB}, \overline{CD}$ and intersecting at $E$, such that $AE = CE < BE = DE$

By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OF = \sqrt{OB^2 - BF^2} = \sqrt{42^2 - 39^2} = 9\sqrt{3}$, and $EF = \sqrt{OE^2 - OF^2} = 9$
Then $OEF$ is a $30-60-90$ right triangle, so $\angle OEB = \angle OED = 60^{\circ}$
Thus $\angle BEC = 60^{\circ}$, and by the Law of Cosines,
$BC^2 = BE^2 + CE^2 - 2 \cdot BE \cdot CE \cos 60^{\circ} = 42^2.$
It follows that $\triangle BCO$ is an equilateral triangle, so $\angle BOC = 60^{\circ}$
The desired area can be broken up into two regions, $\triangle BCE$ and the region bounded by $\overline{BC}$ and minor arc $\stackrel{\frown}{BC}$
The former can be found by Heron's formula to be $[BCE] = \sqrt{60(60-48)(60-42)(60-30)} = 360\sqrt{3}$
The latter is the difference between the area of sector $BOC$ and the equilateral $\triangle BOC$, or $\frac{1}{6}\pi (42)^2 - \frac{42^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = 294\pi - 441\sqrt{3}$.
Thus, the desired area is $360\sqrt{3} + 294\pi - 441\sqrt{3} = 294\pi - 81\sqrt{3}$, and $m+n+d = \boxed{378}$.
We label the points as following: the centers of the circles of radii $3,6,9$ are $O_3,O_6,O_9$ respectively, and the endpoints of the chord are $P,Q$
Let $A_3,A_6,A_9$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $O_3,O_6,O_9$ to $\overline{PQ}$ (so $A_3,A_6$ are the points of tangency)
Then we note that $\overline{O_3A_3} \parallel \overline{O_6A_6} \parallel \overline{O_9A_9}$, and $O_6O_9 : O_9O_3 = 3:6 = 1:2$
Thus, $O_9A_9 = \frac{2 \cdot O_6A_6 + 1 \cdot O_3A_3}{3} = 5$ (consider similar triangles)
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $\triangle O_9A_9P$, we find that\[PQ^2 = 4(A_9P)^2 = 4[(O_9P)^2-(O_9A_9)^2] = 4[9^2-5^2] = \boxed{224}\]

[/asy] We look at triangle $\triangle BDE$, where $\overline{BE}$ is the space diagonal
$\overline{DE}$ is a side length of the cube with length $s$
$\overline{BD}$ is the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with legs length $s$, so its length is $\sqrt{s^2+s^2}=s\sqrt{2}$
So we have \[BE=\sqrt{DE^2+BD^2}=\sqrt{s^2+(s\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{3s^2} = s\sqrt{3}.\]Thus, the space diagonal of a cube with side length $s$ has length $s\sqrt{3}$
The sphere has diameter 9, which is equal to the space diagonal of the cube, so we have \[9 = s\sqrt{3} \quad\Rightarrow \quad s = \frac{9}{\sqrt{3}}.\]Finally, the volume of the cube is $s^3 = \left(\frac{9}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^3 = \boxed{81\sqrt{3}}$.
Since $\angle{BAD}=90$ and $\angle{EAF}=60$, it follows that $\angle{DAF}+\angle{BAE}=90-60=30$
Rotate triangle $ADF$ $60$ degrees clockwise
Note that the image of $AF$ is $AE$
Let the image of $D$ be $D'$
Since angles are preserved under rotation, $\angle{DAF}=\angle{D'AE}$
It follows that $\angle{D'AE}+\angle{BAE}=\angle{D'AB}=30$
Since $\angle{ADF}=\angle{ABE}=90$, it follows that quadrilateral $ABED'$ is cyclic with circumdiameter $AE=s$ and thus circumradius $\frac{s}{2}$
Let $O$ be its circumcenter
By Inscribed Angles, $\angle{BOD'}=2\angle{BAD}=60$
By the definition of circle, $OB=OD'$
It follows that triangle $OBD'$ is equilateral
Therefore, $BD'=r=\frac{s}{2}$
Applying the Law of Cosines to triangle $ABD'$, $\frac{s}{2}=\sqrt{10^2+11^2-(2)(10)(11)(\cos{30})}$
Squaring and multiplying by $\sqrt{3}$ yields $\frac{s^2\sqrt{3}}{4}=221\sqrt{3}-330\implies{p+q+r=221+3+330=\boxed{554}}$
We set up a coordinate system, with the starting point of the car at the origin
At time $t$, the car is at $\left(\frac 23t,0\right)$ and the center of the storm is at $\left(\frac{t}{2}, 110 - \frac{t}{2}\right)$
Using the distance formula,
\begin{eqnarray*} \sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{3}t - \frac 12t\right)^2 + \left(110-\frac{t}{2}\right)^2} &\le& 51\\ \frac{t^2}{36} + \frac{t^2}{4} - 110t + 110^2 &\le& 51^2\\ \frac{5}{18}t^2 - 110t + 110^2 - 51^2 &\le& 0\\ \end{eqnarray*}
Noting that $\frac 12(t_1+t_2)$ is at the maximum point of the parabola, we can use $-\frac{b}{2a} = \frac{110}{2 \cdot \frac{5}{18}} = \boxed{198}$.

This approach uses analytical geometry
Let $A$ be at the origin, $B$ at $(20,0,0)$, $C$ at $(20,0,20)$, and $D$ at $(20,20,20)$
Thus, $P$ is at $(5,0,0)$, $Q$ is at $(20,0,15)$, and $R$ is at $(20,10,20)$.
Let the plane $PQR$ have the equation $ax + by + cz = d$
Using point $P$, we get that $5a = d$
Using point $Q$, we get $20a + 15c = d \Longrightarrow 4d + 15c = d \Longrightarrow d = -5c$
Using point $R$, we get $20a + 10b + 20c = d \Longrightarrow 4d + 10b - 4d = d \Longrightarrow d = 10b$
Thus plane $PQR$’s equation reduces to $\frac{d}{5}x + \frac{d}{10}y - \frac{d}{5}z = d \Longrightarrow 2x + y - 2z = 10$.
We know need to find the intersection of this plane with that of $z = 0$, $z = 20$, $x = 0$, and $y = 20$
After doing a little bit of algebra, the intersections are the lines $y = -2x + 10$, $y = -2x + 50$, $y = 2z + 10$, and $z = x + 5$
Thus, there are three more vertices on the polygon, which are at $(0,10,0)(0,20,5)(15,20,20)$.
We can find the lengths of the sides of the polygons now
There are 4 right triangles with legs of length 5 and 10, so their hypotenuses are $5\sqrt{5}$
The other two are of $45-45-90 \triangle$s with legs of length 15, so their hypotenuses are $15\sqrt{2}$
So we have a hexagon with sides $15\sqrt{2},5\sqrt{5}, 5\sqrt{5},15\sqrt{2}, 5\sqrt{5},5\sqrt{5}$ By symmetry, we know that opposite angles of the polygon are congruent
We can also calculate the length of the long diagonal by noting that it is of the same length of a face diagonal, making it $20\sqrt{2}$.

The height of the triangles at the top/bottom is $\frac{20\sqrt{2} - 15\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{5}{2}\sqrt{2}$
The Pythagorean Theorem gives that half of the base of the triangles is $\frac{15}{\sqrt{2}}$
We find that the middle rectangle is actually a square, so the total area is $(15\sqrt{2})^2 + 4\left(\frac 12\right)\left(\frac 52\sqrt{2}\right)\left(\frac{15}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \boxed{525}$.

Let $Q$ be the tangency point on $\overline{AC}$, and $R$ on $\overline{BC}$
By the Two Tangent Theorem, $AP = AQ = 23$, $BP = BR = 27$, and $CQ = CR = x$
Using $rs = A$, where $s = \frac{27 \cdot 2 + 23 \cdot 2 + x \cdot 2}{2} = 50 + x$, we get $(21)(50 + x) = A$
By Heron's formula, $A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{(50+x)(x)(23)(27)}$
Equating and squaring both sides,
\begin{eqnarray*}  [21(50+x)]^2 &=& (50+x)(x)(621)\\ 441(50+x) &=& 621x\\ 180x = 441 \cdot 50 &\Longrightarrow & x = \frac{245}{2}   \end{eqnarray*}
We want the perimeter, which is $2s = 2\left(50 + \frac{245}{2}\right) = \boxed{345}$.

As shown in the image above, let $D$, $E$, and $F$ be the midpoints of $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{CA}$, and $\overline{AB}$, respectively
Suppose $P$ is the apex of the tetrahedron, and let $O$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to $\triangle ABC$
The crux of this problem is the following lemma.
Lemma: The point $O$ is the orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$.
Observe that\[OF^2 - OE^2 = PF^2 - PE^2 = AF^2 - AE^2;\]the first equality follows by the Pythagorean Theorem, while the second follows from $AF = FP$ and $AE = EP$
Thus, by the Perpendicularity Lemma, $AO$ is perpendicular to $FE$ and hence $BC$
Analogously, $O$ lies on the $B$-altitude and $C$-altitude of $\triangle ABC$, and so $O$ is, indeed, the orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$.
To find the coordinates of $O$, we need to find the intersection point of altitudes $BE$ and $AD$
The equation of $BE$ is simply $x=16$
$AD$ is perpendicular to line $BC$, so the slope of $AD$ is equal to the negative reciprocal of the slope of $BC$
$BC$ has slope $\frac{24-0}{16-34}=-\frac{4}{3}$, therefore $y=\frac{3}{4} x$
These two lines intersect at $(16,12)$, so that's the base of the height of the tetrahedron.
Let $S$ be the foot of altitude $BS$ in $\triangle BPQ$
From the Pythagorean Theorem, $h=\sqrt{BS^2-SO^2}$
However, since $S$ and $O$ are, by coincidence, the same point, $SO=0$ and $h=12$.
The area of the base is $102$, so the volume is $\frac{102*12}{3}=\boxed{408}$.
Let the first point on the line $x=10$ be $(10,45+a)$ where a is the height above $(10,45)$
Let the second point on the line $x=28$ be $(28, 153-a)$
For two given points, the line will pass the origin if the coordinates are proportional (such that $\frac{y_1}{x_1} = \frac{y_2}{x_2}$)
Then, we can write that $\frac{45 + a}{10} = \frac{153 - a}{28}$
Solving for $a$ yields that $1530 - 10a = 1260 + 28a$, so $a=\frac{270}{38}=\frac{135}{19}$
The slope of the line (since it passes through the origin) is $\frac{45 + \frac{135}{19}}{10} = \frac{99}{19}$, and the solution is $m + n = \boxed{118}$.
Triangles $AOB$, $BOC$, $COD$, etc
are congruent by symmetry (you can prove it rigorously by using the power of a point to argue that exactly two chords of length $1$ in the circumcircle of the squares pass through $B$, etc.), and each area is $\frac{\frac{43}{99}\cdot\frac{1}{2}}{2}$
Since the area of a triangle is $bh/2$, the area of all $8$ of them is $\frac{86}{99}$ and the answer is $\boxed{185}$.
Let the intersection of the highways be at the origin $O$, and let the highways be the x and y axes
We consider the case where the truck moves in the positive x direction.
After going $x$ miles, $t=\frac{d}{r}=\frac{x}{50}$ hours has passed
If the truck leaves the highway it can travel for at most $t=\frac{1}{10}-\frac{x}{50}$ hours, or $d=rt=14t=1.4-\frac{7x}{25}$ miles
It can end up anywhere off the highway in a circle with this radius centered at $(x,0)$
All these circles are homothetic with respect to a center at $(5,0)$.

Now consider the circle at $(0,0)$
Draw a line tangent to it at $A$ and passing through $B (5,0)$
By the Pythagorean Theorem $AB^2+AO^2=OB^2 \Longrightarrow AB=\sqrt{OB^2-AO^2}=\sqrt{5^2-1.4^2}=\frac{24}{5}$
Then $\tan(\angle ABO)=\frac{OA}{AB}=\frac{7}{24}$, so the slope of line $AB$ is $\frac{-7}{24}$
Since it passes through $(5,0)$ its equation is $y=\frac{-7}{24}(x-5)$.
This line and the x and y axis bound the region the truck can go if it moves in the positive x direction
Similarly, the line $y=5-\frac{24}{7}x$ bounds the region the truck can go if it moves in positive y direction
The intersection of these two lines is $\left(\frac{35}{31},\frac{35}{31}\right)$
The bounded region in Quadrant I is made up of a square and two triangles
$A=x^2+x(5-x)=5x$
By symmetry, the regions in the other quadrants are the same, so the area of the whole region is $20x=\frac{700}{31}$ so the answer is $700+31=\boxed{731}$.
The measure of each exterior angle in a regular $n$-gon is $360/n$ degrees
Setting this expression equal to 15, we find $n=\boxed{24}$.
[asy] pointpen = black; pathpen = linewidth(0.7) + black; size(180); pair A=(11,10), B=(10,11), C=(-10, 11), D=(-10, -11), E=(10, -11); D(D(MP("A\ (u,v)",A,(1,0)))--D(MP("B",B,N))--D(MP("C",C,N))--D(MP("D",D))--D(MP("E",E))--cycle); D((-15,0)--(15,0),linewidth(0.6),Arrows(5)); D((0,-15)--(0,15),linewidth(0.6),Arrows(5)); D((-15,-15)--(15,15),linewidth(0.6),Arrows(5)); [/asy]
Since $A = (u,v)$, we can find the coordinates of the other points: $B = (v,u)$, $C = (-v,u)$, $D = (-v,-u)$, $E = (v,-u)$
If we graph those points, we notice that since the latter four points are all reflected across the x/y-axis, they form a rectangle, and $ABE$ is a triangle
The area of $BCDE$ is $(2u)(2v) = 4uv$ and the area of $ABE$ is $\frac{1}{2}(2u)(u-v) = u^2 - uv$
Adding these together, we get $u^2 + 3uv = u(u+3v) = 451 = 11 \cdot 41$
Since $u,v$ are positive, $u+3v>u$, and by matching factors we get either $(u,v) = (1,150)$ or $(11,10)$
Since $v < u$ the latter case is the answer, and $u+v = \boxed{21}$.
Call the squares' side lengths from smallest to largest $a_1,\ldots,a_9$, and let $l,w$ represent the dimensions of the rectangle.
The picture shows that\begin{align*} a_1+a_2 &= a_3\\ a_1 + a_3 &= a_4\\ a_3 + a_4 &= a_5\\ a_4 + a_5 &= a_6\\ a_2 + a_3 + a_5 &= a_7\\ a_2 + a_7 &= a_8\\ a_1 + a_4 + a_6 &= a_9\\ a_6 + a_9 &= a_7 + a_8.\end{align*}
Expressing all terms 3 to 9 in terms of $a_1$ and $a_2$ and substituting their expanded forms into the previous equation will give the expression $5a_1 = 2a_2$.
We can guess that $a_1 = 2$
(If we started with $a_1$ odd, the resulting sides would not be integers and we would need to scale up by a factor of $2$ to make them integers; if we started with $a_1 > 2$ even, the resulting dimensions would not be relatively prime and we would need to scale down.) Then solving gives $a_9 = 36$, $a_6=25$, $a_8 = 33$, which gives us $l=61,w=69$
These numbers are relatively prime, as desired
The perimeter is $2(61)+2(69)=\boxed{260}$.
Call the center of the circle $O$
By drawing the lines from $O$ tangent to the sides and from $O$ to the vertices of the quadrilateral, four pairs of congruent right triangles are formed.
Thus, $\angle{AOP}+\angle{POB}+\angle{COQ}+\angle{QOD}=180$, or $(\arctan(\tfrac{19}{r})+\arctan(\tfrac{26}{r}))+(\arctan(\tfrac{37}{r})+\arctan(\tfrac{23}{r}))=180$.
Take the $\tan$ of both sides and use the identity for $\tan(A+B)$ to get\[\tan(\arctan(\tfrac{19}{r})+\arctan(\tfrac{26}{r}))+\tan(\arctan(\tfrac{37}{r})+\arctan(\tfrac{23}{r}))=n\cdot0=0.\]
Use the identity for $\tan(A+B)$ again to get\[\frac{\tfrac{45}{r}}{1-19\cdot\tfrac{26}{r^2}}+\frac{\tfrac{60}{r}}{1-37\cdot\tfrac{23}{r^2}}=0.\]
Solving gives $r^2=\boxed{647}$.
For simplicity, we translate the points so that $A$ is on the origin and $D = (1,7)$
Suppose $B$ has integer coordinates; then $\overrightarrow{AB}$ is a vector with integer parameters (vector knowledge is not necessary for this solution)
We construct the perpendicular from $A$ to $\overline{CD}$, and let $D' = (a,b)$ be the reflection of $D$ across that perpendicular
Then $ABCD'$ is a parallelogram, and $\overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{D'C}$
Thus, for $C$ to have integer coordinates, it suffices to let $D'$ have integer coordinates.[1]
[asy] pathpen = linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0), D=(1,7), Da = MP("D'",D((-7,1)),N), B=(-8,-6), C=B+Da, F=foot(A,C,D); D(MP("A",A)--MP("B",B)--MP("C",C,N)--MP("D",D,N)--cycle); D(F--A--Da,linetype("4 4"));  [/asy]
Let the slope of the perpendicular be $m$
Then the midpoint of $\overline{DD'}$ lies on the line $y=mx$, so $\frac{b+7}{2} = m \cdot \frac{a+1}{2}$
Also, $AD = AD'$ implies that $a^2 + b^2 = 1^2 + 7^2 = 50$
Combining these two equations yields
\[a^2 + \left(7 - (a+1)m\right)^2 = 50\]
Since $a$ is an integer, then $7-(a+1)m$ must be an integer
There are $12$ pairs of integers whose squares sum up to $50,$ namely $( \pm 1, \pm 7), (\pm 7, \pm 1), (\pm 5, \pm 5)$
We exclude the cases $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$ because they lead to degenerate trapezoids (rectangle, line segment, vertical and horizontal sides)
Thus we have
\[7 - 8m = \pm 1, \quad 7 + 6m = \pm 1, \quad 7 - 6m = \pm 5, 7 + 4m = \pm 5\]
These yield $m = 1, \frac 34, -1, -\frac 43, 2, \frac 13, -3, - \frac 12$, and the sum of their absolute values is $\frac{119}{12}$
The answer is $m+n= \boxed{131}$.
Let $D$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $O$ to the plane of $ABC$
By the Pythagorean Theorem on triangles $\triangle OAD$, $\triangle OBD$ and $\triangle OCD$ we get:
\[DA^2=DB^2=DC^2=20^2-OD^2\]
It follows that $DA=DB=DC$, so $D$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$.
By Heron's Formula the area of $\triangle ABC$ is (alternatively, a $13-14-15$ triangle may be split into $9-12-15$ and $5-12-13$ right triangles):
\[K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{21(21-15)(21-14)(21-13)} = 84\]
From $R = \frac{abc}{4K}$, we know that the circumradius of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\[R = \frac{abc}{4K} = \frac{(13)(14)(15)}{4(84)} = \frac{65}{8}\]
Thus by the Pythagorean Theorem again,
\[OD = \sqrt{20^2-R^2} = \sqrt{20^2-\frac{65^2}{8^2}} = \frac{15\sqrt{95}}{8}.\]
So the final answer is $15+95+8=\boxed{118}$.
Let the shorter base have length $b$ (so the longer has length $b+100$), and let the height be $h$
The length of the midline of the trapezoid is the average of its bases, which is $\frac{b+b+100}{2} = b+50$
The two regions which the midline divides the trapezoid into are two smaller trapezoids, both with height $h/2$
[asy]pathpen = linewidth(0.7); pen d = linetype("4 4") + linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(175,0),C=(105,100),D=(30,100); D(A--B--C--D--cycle); D((A+D)/2 -- (B+C)/2, d); MP("b",(C+D)/2,N);MP("b+100",(A+B)/2);  [/asy]
\[\frac{\frac 12 (h/2) (b + b+50)}{\frac 12 (h/2) (b + 50 + b + 100)} = \frac{2}{3} \Longrightarrow \frac{b + 75}{b + 25} = \frac 32 \Longrightarrow b = 75\]
We now construct the line which divides the rectangle into two regions of equal area
Suppose this line is a distance of $h_1$ from the shorter base
By similar triangles, we have $\frac{x - 75}{100} = \frac{h_1}{h}$
Indeed, construct the perpendiculars from the vertices of the shorter base to the longer base
This splits the trapezoid into a rectangle and two triangles; it also splits the desired line segment into three partitions with lengths $x_1, 75, x_2$
By similar triangles, we easily find that $\frac{x - 75}{100} = \frac{x_1+x_2}{100} = \frac{h_1}{h}$, as desired.
[asy]pathpen = linewidth(0.7); pen d = linetype("4 4") + linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(175,0),C=(105,100),D=(30,100),E=D*(1.75-(18125)^.5/100),F=IP(B--C,E--(175,E.y)); D(A--B--C--D--cycle); MP("75",(C+D)/2,N);MP("175",(A+B)/2); D(C--(C.x,0),d);D(D--(D.x,0),d); D(E--F,d); D((-20,100)--(-20,0)); MP("h",(-20,50),(-1,0));MP("h_1",(C.x,(C.y+E.y)/2),(-1,0)); MP("x_1",((E.x+D.x)/2,E.y));MP("x_2",((F.x+C.x)/2,E.y)); [/asy]
The area of the region including the shorter base must be half of the area of the entire trapezoid, so
\[2 \cdot \frac 12 h_1 (75 + x) = \frac 12 h (75 + 175) \Longrightarrow x = 125 \cdot \frac{h}{h_1} - 75\]
Substituting our expression for $\frac h{h_1}$ from above, we find that
\[x = \frac{12500}{x-75} - 75 \Longrightarrow x^2 - 75x = 5625 + 12500 - 75x \Longrightarrow x^2 = 18125\]
The answer is $\left\lfloor\frac{x^2}{100}\right\rfloor = \boxed{181}$.
Let $x = BC$ be the height of the trapezoid, and let $y = CD$
Since $AC \perp BD$, it follows that $\triangle BAC \sim \triangle CBD$, so $\frac{x}{\sqrt{11}} = \frac{y}{x} \Longrightarrow x^2 = y\sqrt{11}$.
Let $E$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $\overline{CD}$
Then $AE = x$, and $ADE$ is a right triangle
By the Pythagorean Theorem,
\[x^2 + \left(y-\sqrt{11}\right)^2 = 1001 \Longrightarrow x^4 - 11x^2 - 11^2 \cdot 9 \cdot 10 = 0\]
The positive solution to this quadratic equation is $x^2 = \boxed{110}$.

Denote the vertices of the triangle $A,B,$ and $C,$ where $B$ is in quadrant 4 and $C$ is in quadrant $3.$
Note that the slope of $\overline{AC}$ is $\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt {3}.$ Hence, the equation of the line containing $\overline{AC}$ is\[y = x\sqrt {3} + 1.\]This will intersect the ellipse when\begin{eqnarray*}4 = x^{2} + 4y^{2} & = & x^{2} + 4(x\sqrt {3} + 1)^{2} \\ & = & x^{2} + 4(3x^{2} + 2x\sqrt {3} + 1) \implies x(13x+8\sqrt 3)=0\implies x = \frac { - 8\sqrt {3}}{13}
\end{eqnarray*}We ignore the $x=0$ solution because it is not in quadrant 3.
Since the triangle is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, the coordinates of $B$ and $C$ are now $\left(\frac {8\sqrt {3}}{13},y_{0}\right)$ and $\left(\frac { - 8\sqrt {3}}{13},y_{0}\right),$ respectively, for some value of $y_{0}.$
It is clear that the value of $y_{0}$ is irrelevant to the length of $BC$
Our answer is\[BC = 2*\frac {8\sqrt {3}}{13}=\sqrt {4\left(\frac {8\sqrt {3}}{13}\right)^{2}} = \sqrt {\frac {768}{169}}\implies m + n = \boxed{937}.\]
The triangle below the line has height 2, and base 3, making for a total area of 3, which is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the total area, meaning that $\frac{2}{3}$ of the area is above the line
You can also do this by visually dividing the square into 3 equal-area horizontal rectangles, noticing that the triangle covers half the area of the bottom two, thereby leaving $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$ of the square above the line.

Let $I$ be the incenter of $\triangle ABC$, so that $BI$ and $CI$ are angle bisectors of $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ACB$ respectively
Then, $\angle BID = \angle CBI = \angle DBI,$ so $\triangle BDI$ is isosceles, and similarly $\triangle CEI$ is isosceles
It follows that $DE = DB + EC$, so the perimeter of $\triangle ADE$ is $AD + AE + DE = AB + AC = 43$
Hence, the ratio of the perimeters of $\triangle ADE$ and $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{43}{63}$, which is the scale factor between the two similar triangles, and thus $DE = \frac{43}{63} \times 20 = \frac{860}{63}$
Thus, $m + n = \boxed{923}$.

We let $[\ldots]$ denote area; then the desired value is
$\frac mn = \frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = \frac{[ABC] - [ADF] - [BDE] - [CEF]}{[ABC]}$
Using the formula for the area of a triangle $\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C$, we find that
$\frac{[ADF]}{[ABC]} = \frac{\frac 12 \cdot p \cdot AB \cdot (1-r) \cdot AC \cdot \sin \angle CAB}{\frac 12 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin \angle CAB} = p(1-r)$
and similarly that $\frac{[BDE]}{[ABC]} = q(1-p)$ and $\frac{[CEF]}{[ABC]} = r(1-q)$
Thus, we wish to find\begin{align*}\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} &= 1 - \frac{[ADF]}{[ABC]} - \frac{[BDE]}{[ABC]} - \frac{[CEF]}{[ABC]}  \\ &= 1 - p(1-r) - q(1-p) - r(1-q)\\ &= (pq + qr + rp) - (p + q + r) + 1 \end{align*}We know that $p + q + r = \frac 23$, and also that $(p+q+r)^2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2(pq + qr + rp) \Longleftrightarrow pq + qr + rp = \frac{\left(\frac 23\right)^2 - \frac 25}{2} = \frac{1}{45}$
Substituting, the answer is $\frac 1{45} - \frac 23 + 1 = \frac{16}{45}$, and $m+n = \boxed{61}$.
On the first construction, $P_1$, four new tetrahedra will be constructed with side lengths $\frac 12$ of the original one
Since the ratio of the volume of similar polygons is the cube of the ratio of their corresponding lengths, it follows that each of these new tetrahedra will have volume $\left(\frac 12\right)^3 = \frac 18$
The total volume added here is then $\Delta P_1 = 4 \cdot \frac 18 = \frac 12$.
We now note that for each midpoint triangle we construct in step $P_{i}$, there are now $6$ places to construct new midpoint triangles for step $P_{i+1}$
The outward tetrahedron for the midpoint triangle provides $3$ of the faces, while the three equilateral triangles surrounding the midpoint triangle provide the other $3$
This is because if you read this question carefully, it asks to add new tetrahedra to each face of $P_{i}$ which also includes the ones that were left over when we did the previous addition of tetrahedra
However, the volume of the tetrahedra being constructed decrease by a factor of $\frac 18$
Thus we have the recursion $\Delta P_{i+1} = \frac{6}{8} \Delta P_i$, and so $\Delta P_i = \frac 12 \cdot \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{i-1} P_1$.
The volume of $P_3 = P_0 + \Delta P_1 + \Delta P_2 + \Delta P_3 = 1 + \frac 12 + \frac 38 + \frac 9{32} = \frac{69}{32}$, and $m+n=\boxed{101}$
Note that the summation was in fact a geometric series.
Extend $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BC}$ to meet at $E$
Then, since $\angle BAD = \angle ADC$ and $\angle ABD = \angle DCE$, we know that $\triangle ABD \sim \triangle DCE$
Hence $\angle ADB = \angle DEC$, and $\triangle BDE$ is isosceles
Then $BD = BE = 10$.

Using the similarity, we have:
\[\frac{AB}{BD} = \frac 8{10} = \frac{CD}{CE} = \frac{CD}{16} \Longrightarrow CD = \frac{64}5\]
The answer is $m+n = \boxed{69}$.

Set the coordinate system so that vertex $E$, where the drilling starts, is at $(8,8,8)$
Using a little visualization (involving some similar triangles, because we have parallel lines) shows that the tunnel meets the bottom face (the xy plane one) in the line segments joining $(1,0,0)$ to $(2,2,0)$, and $(0,1,0)$ to $(2,2,0)$, and similarly for the other three faces meeting at the origin (by symmetry)
So one face of the tunnel is the polygon with vertices (in that order), $S(1,0,0), T(2,0,2), U(8,6,8), V(8,8,6), W(2,2,0)$, and the other two faces of the tunnel are congruent to this shape.
Observe that this shape is made up of two congruent trapezoids each with height $\sqrt {2}$ and bases $7\sqrt {3}$ and $6\sqrt {3}$
Together they make up an area of $\sqrt {2}(7\sqrt {3} + 6\sqrt {3}) = 13\sqrt {6}$
The total area of the tunnel is then $3\cdot13\sqrt {6} = 39\sqrt {6}$
Around the corner $E$ we're missing an area of $6$, the same goes for the corner opposite $E$
So the outside area is $6\cdot 64 - 2\cdot 6 = 372$
Thus the the total surface area is $372 + 39\sqrt {6}$, and the answer is $372 + 39 + 6 = \boxed{417}$.

The coordinates of $P$ can be written as $\left(a, \frac{15a}8\right)$ and the coordinates of point $Q$ can be written as $\left(b,\frac{3b}{10}\right)$
By the midpoint formula, we have $\frac{a+b}2=8$ and $\frac{15a}{16}+\frac{3b}{20}=6$
Solving for $b$ gives $b= \frac{80}{7}$, so the point $Q$ is $\left(\frac{80}7, \frac{24}7\right)$
The answer is twice the distance from $Q$ to $(8,6)$, which by the distance formula is $\frac{60}{7}$
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{67}$.
Let $O$ be the center of the circle, and $2a$ be the side length of $ABCD$, $2b$ be the side length of $EFGH$
By the Pythagorean Theorem, the radius of $\odot O = OC = a\sqrt{2}$.

Now consider right triangle $OGI$, where $I$ is the midpoint of $\overline{GH}$
Then, by the Pythagorean Theorem,
\begin{align*} OG^2 = 2a^2 &= OI^2 + GI^2 = (a+2b)^2 + b^2 \\ 0 &= a^2 - 4ab - 5b^2 = (a - 5b)(a + b) \end{align*}
Thus $a = 5b$ (since lengths are positive, we discard the other root)
The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths, so $\frac{[EFGH]}{[ABCD]} = \left(\frac 15\right)^2 = \frac{1}{25}$, and the answer is $10n + m = \boxed{251}$.
Another way to proceed from $0 = a^2 - 4ab - 5b^2$ is to note that $\frac{b}{a}$ is the quantity we need; thus, we divide by $a^2$ to get
\[0 = 1 - 4\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) - 5\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2\]This is a quadratic in $\frac{b}{a}$, and solving it gives $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{1}{5},-1$
The negative solution is extraneous, and so the ratio of the areas is $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{25}$ and the answer is $10\cdot 25 + 1 = \boxed{251}$.

Let $P = (0,0)$ be at the origin
Using the formula $A = rs$ on $\triangle PQR$, where $r_{1}$ is the inradius (similarly define $r_2, r_3$ to be the radii of $C_2, C_3$), $s = \frac{PQ + QR + RP}{2} = 180$ is the semiperimeter, and $A = \frac 12 bh = 5400$ is the area, we find $r_{1} = \frac As = 30$
Or, the inradius could be directly by using the formula $\frac{a+b-c}{2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the legs of the right triangle and $c$ is the hypotenuse
(This formula should be used only for right triangles.) Thus $ST, UV$ lie respectively on the lines $y = 60, x = 60$, and so $RS = 60, UQ = 30$.
Note that $\triangle PQR \sim \triangle STR \sim \triangle UQV$
Since the ratio of corresponding lengths of similar figures are the same, we have
\[\frac{r_{1}}{PR} = \frac{r_{2}}{RS} \Longrightarrow r_{2} = 15\ \text{and} \ \frac{r_{1}}{PQ} = \frac{r_{3}}{UQ} \Longrightarrow r_{3} = 10.\]
Let the centers of $\odot C_2, C_3$ be $O_2 = (0 + r_{2}, 60 + r_{2}) = (15, 75), O_3 = (60 + r_{3}, 0 + r_{3}) = (70,10)$, respectively; then by the distance formula we have $O_2O_3 = \sqrt{55^2 + 65^2} = \sqrt{10 \cdot 725}$
Therefore, the answer is $n = \boxed{725}$.
When a light beam reflects off a surface, the path is like that of a ball bouncing
Picture that, and also imagine X, Y, and Z coordinates for the cube vertices
The coordinates will all involve 0's and 12's only, so that means that the X, Y, and Z distance traveled by the light must all be divisible by 12
Since the light's Y changes by 5 and the X changes by 7 (the Z changes by 12, don't worry about that), and 5 and 7 are relatively prime to 12, the light must make 12 reflections onto the XY plane or the face parallel to the XY plane.
In each reflection, the distance traveled by the light is $\sqrt{ (12^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) }$ = $\sqrt{218}$
This happens 12 times, so the total distance is $12\sqrt{218}$
$m=12$ and $n=218$, so therefore, the answer is $m+n=\boxed{230}$.

Applying Stewart's Theorem to medians $AD, CE$, we have:
\begin{align*} BC^2 + 4 \cdot 18^2 &= 2\left(24^2 + AC^2\right) \\ 24^2 + 4 \cdot 27^2 &= 2\left(AC^2 + BC^2\right)  \end{align*}
Substituting the first equation into the second and simplification yields $24^2 = 2\left(3AC^2 + 2 \cdot 24^2 - 4 \cdot 18^2\right)- 4 \cdot 27^2$ $\Longrightarrow AC = \sqrt{2^5 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 3^5 + 2^4 \cdot 3^3 - 2^7 \cdot 3} = 3\sqrt{70}$.
By the Power of a Point Theorem on $E$, we get $EF = \frac{12^2}{27} = \frac{16}{3}$
The Law of Cosines on $\triangle ACE$ gives
\begin{align*} \cos \angle AEC = \left(\frac{12^2 + 27^2 - 9 \cdot 70}{2 \cdot 12 \cdot 27}\right) = \frac{3}{8} \end{align*}
Hence $\sin \angle AEC = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \angle AEC} = \frac{\sqrt{55}}{8}$
Because $\triangle AEF, BEF$ have the same height and equal bases, they have the same area, and $[ABF] = 2[AEF] = 2 \cdot \frac 12 \cdot AE \cdot EF \sin \angle AEF = 12 \cdot \frac{16}{3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{55}}{8} = 8\sqrt{55}$, and the answer is $8 + 55 = \boxed{63}$.

Then $x + y = AB = 13$, $x + z = AC = 15$, and $y + z = BC = 14$
Adding all these equations, we get $2x + 2y + 2z = 42$, so $x + y + z = 21$
Subtracting the equation $x + z = 15$, we get $y = 6$.
By Heron's formula, the area of triangle $ABC$ is \[K = \sqrt{21(21 - 14)(21 - 15)(21 - 13)} = 84,\]so the inradius is $r = K/s = 84/21 = 4$.
Hence, by Pythagoras on right triangle $BDI$, \[BI = \sqrt{BD^2 + DI^2} = \sqrt{y^2 + r^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{52} = \boxed{2 \sqrt{13}}.\]
Let the circle intersect $\overline{PM}$ at $B$
Then note $\triangle OPB$ and $\triangle MPA$ are similar
Also note that $AM = BM$ by power of a point
Using the fact that the ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal to the ratio of their perimeters, we have\[\frac{19}{AM} = \frac{152-2AM-19+19}{152} = \frac{152-2AM}{152}\]Solving, $AM = 38$
So the ratio of the side lengths of the triangles is 2
Therefore,\[\frac{PB+38}{OP}= 2 \text{ and } \frac{OP+19}{PB} = 2\]so $2OP = PB+38$ and $2PB = OP+19.$ Substituting for $PB$, we see that $4OP-76 = OP+19$, so $OP = \frac{95}3$ and the answer is $\boxed{98}$.
Let the smaller angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$ be $\theta$
Note that the centers of the two circles lie on the angle bisector of the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$
Also note that if $(x,y)$ is on said angle bisector, we have that $\frac{y}{x}=\tan{\frac{\theta}{2}}$
Let $\tan{\frac{\theta}{2}}=m_1$, for convenience
Therefore if $(x,y)$ is on the angle bisector, then $x=\frac{y}{m_1}$
Now let the centers of the two relevant circles be $(a/m_1 , a)$ and $(b/m_1 , b)$ for some positive reals $a$ and $b$
These two circles are tangent to the $x$-axis, so the radii of the circles are $a$ and $b$ respectively
We know that the point $(9,6)$ is a point on both circles, so we have that
\[(9-\frac{a}{m_1})^2+(6-a)^2=a^2\]
\[(9-\frac{b}{m_1})^2+(6-b)^2=b^2\]
Expanding these and manipulating terms gives
\[\frac{1}{m_1^2}a^2-[(18/m_1)+12]a+117=0\]
\[\frac{1}{m_1^2}b^2-[(18/m_1)+12]b+117=0\]
It follows that $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic
\[\frac{1}{m_1^2}x^2-[(18/m_1)+12]x+117=0\]
It follows from Vieta's Formulas that the product of the roots of this quadratic is $117m_1^2$, but we were also given that the product of the radii was 68
Therefore $68=117m_1^2$, or $m_1^2=\frac{68}{117}$
Note that the half-angle formula for tangents is
\[\tan{\frac{\theta}{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{1-\cos{\theta}}{1+\cos{\theta}}}\]
Therefore
\[\frac{68}{117}=\frac{1-\cos{\theta}}{1+\cos{\theta}}\]
Solving for $\cos{\theta}$ gives that $\cos{\theta}=\frac{49}{185}$
It then follows that $\sin{\theta}=\sqrt{1-\cos^2{\theta}}=\frac{12\sqrt{221}}{185}$.
It then follows that $m=\tan{\theta}=\frac{12\sqrt{221}}{49}$
Therefore $a=12$, $b=221$, and $c=49$
The desired answer is then $12+221+49=\boxed{282}$.
$PQ=\sqrt{(8-7)^2+(8-12)^2+(1-10)^2}=\sqrt{98}$
$PR=\sqrt{(11-7)^2+(3-12)^2+(9-10)^2}=\sqrt{98}$
$QR=\sqrt{(11-8)^2+(3-8)^2+(9-1)^2}=\sqrt{98}$
So, $PQR$ is an equilateral triangle
Let the side of the cube be $a$.
$a\sqrt{2}=\sqrt{98}$
So, $a=7$, and hence the surface area is $6a^2=\boxed{294}$.

Take point $N$ inside $\triangle ABC$ such that $\angle CBN = 7^\circ$ and $\angle BCN = 23^\circ$.
$\angle MCN = 106^\circ - 2\cdot 23^\circ = 60^\circ$
Also, since $\triangle AMC$ and $\triangle BNC$ are congruent (by ASA), $CM = CN$
Hence $\triangle CMN$ is an equilateral triangle, so $\angle CNM = 60^\circ$.
Then $\angle MNB = 360^\circ - \angle CNM - \angle CNB = 360^\circ - 60^\circ - 150^\circ = 150^\circ$
We now see that $\triangle MNB$ and $\triangle CNB$ are congruent

The set can be broken into several parts: the big $3\times 4 \times 5$ parallelepiped, $6$ external parallelepipeds that each share a face with the large parallelepiped and have a height of $1$, the $1/8$ spheres (one centered at each vertex of the large parallelepiped), and the $1/4$ cylinders connecting each adjacent pair of spheres.
The volume of the parallelepiped is $3 \times 4 \times 5 = 60$ cubic units.
The volume of the external parallelepipeds is $2(3 \times 4 \times 1)+2(3 \times 5 \times 1 )+2(4 \times 5 \times 1)=94$.
There are $8$ of the $1/8$ spheres, each of radius $1$
Together, their volume is $\frac{4}{3}\pi$.
There are $12$ of the $1/4$ cylinders, so $3$ complete cylinders can be formed
Their volumes are $3\pi$, $4\pi$, and $5\pi$, adding up to $12\pi$.
The combined volume of these parts is $60+94+\frac{4}{3}\pi+12\pi = \frac{462+40\pi}{3}$

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find that $h^2 = y^2 - 6^2$ and $h^2 = x^2 - 15^2$
Thus, $y^2 - 36 = x^2 - 225 \Longrightarrow x^2 - y^2 = 189$
The LHS is difference of squares, so $(x + y)(x - y) = 189$
As both $x,\ y$ are integers, $x+y,\ x-y$ must be integral divisors of $189$.
The pairs of divisors of $189$ are $(1,189)\ (3,63)\ (7,27)\ (9,21)$
This yields the four potential sets for $(x,y)$ as $(95,94)\ (33,30)\ (17,10)\ (15,6)$
The last is not a possibility since it simply degenerates into a line
The sum of the three possible perimeters of $\triangle ACD$ is equal to $3(AC) + 2(x_1 + x_2 + x_3) = 90 + 2(95 + 33 + 17) = \boxed{380}$.
We use the Pythagorean Theorem on $ABC$ to determine that $AB=25.$
Let $N$ be the orthogonal projection from $C$ to $AB.$ Thus, $[CDM]=\frac{(DM)(MN)} {2}$, $MN=AM-AN$, and $[ABC]=\frac{24 \cdot 7} {2} =\frac{25 \cdot (CN)} {2}.$
From the third equation, we get $CN=\frac{168} {25}.$
By the Pythagorean Theorem in $\Delta ACN,$ we have
$AN=\sqrt{\left(\frac{24 \cdot 25} {25}\right)^2-\left(\frac{24 \cdot 7} {25}\right)^2}=\frac{24} {25}\sqrt{25^2-7^2}=\frac{576} {25}.$
Thus, $MN=\frac{576} {25}-\frac{25} {2}=\frac{527} {50}.$
In $\Delta ADM$, we use the Pythagorean Theorem to get $DM=\sqrt{15^2-\left(\frac{25} {2}\right)^2}=\frac{5} {2} \sqrt{11}.$
Thus, $[CDM]=\frac{527 \cdot 5\sqrt{11}} {50 \cdot 2 \cdot 2}= \frac{527\sqrt{11}} {40}.$
Hence, the answer is $527+11+40=\boxed{578}.$
The y-coordinate of $F$ must be $4$
All other cases yield non-convex and/or degenerate hexagons, which violate the problem statement.
Letting $F = (f,4)$, and knowing that $\angle FAB = 120^\circ$, we can use rewrite $F$ using complex numbers: $f + 4 i = (b + 2 i)\left(e^{i(2 \pi / 3)}\right) = (b + 2 i)\left(-1/2 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i\right) = -\frac{b}{2}-\sqrt{3}+\left(\frac{b\sqrt{3}}{2}-1\right)i$
We solve for $b$ and $f$ and find that $F = \left(-\frac{8}{\sqrt{3}}, 4\right)$ and that $B = \left(\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}, 2\right)$.
The area of the hexagon can then be found as the sum of the areas of two congruent triangles ($EFA$ and $BCD$, with height $8$ and base $\frac{8}{\sqrt{3}}$) and a parallelogram ($ABDE$, with height $8$ and base $\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}$).
$A = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times \frac{8}{\sqrt{3}} + 8 \times \frac{10}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{144}{\sqrt{3}} = 48\sqrt{3}$.
Thus, $m+n = \boxed{51}$.
Embed the tetrahedron in 4-space to make calculations easier
Its vertices are $(1,0,0,0)$, $(0,1,0,0)$, $(0,0,1,0)$, $(0,0,0,1)$.
To get the center of any face, we take the average of the three coordinates of that face
The vertices of the center of the faces are: $(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0)$,$(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3},0, \frac{1}{3})$,$(\frac{1}{3},0, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3})$,$(0,\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3})$.
The side length of the large tetrahedron is $\sqrt{2}$ by the distance formula
The side length of the smaller tetrahedron is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}$ by the distance formula.
Their ratio is $1:3$, so the ratio of their volumes is $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{27}$.
$m+n = 1 + 27 = \boxed{28}$.
Let $T_1, T_2$, and $T_3$ denote the points of tangency of $AB, AC,$ and $BC$ with $\omega$, respectively.

Then $7 = BC=BT_3+T_3C = BT_1 + CT_2$
By Pythagoras, $AT_1 = AT_2 = \sqrt{13^2-5^2}=12$
Now note that $24 = AT_1 + AT_2 = AB + BT_1 + AC + CT_2 = AB+AC+7$, which gives $AB + AC = \boxed{17}$.
The volume of the wedge is half the volume of a cylinder with height $12$ and radius $6$
(Imagine taking another identical wedge and sticking it to the existing one)
Thus, $V=\dfrac{6^2\cdot 12\pi}{2}=216\pi$, so $n=\boxed{216}$.
Since a $13-14-15$ triangle is a $5-12-13$ triangle and a $9-12-15$ triangle "glued" together on the $12$ side, $[ABC]=\frac{1}{2}\cdot12\cdot14=84$.
There are six points of intersection between $\Delta ABC$ and $\Delta A'B'C'$

There are $12$ smaller congruent triangles which make up the desired area
Also, $\Delta ABC$ is made up of $9$ of such triangles
Therefore, $\left[\Delta ABC \bigcup \Delta A'B'C'\right] = \frac{12}{9}[\Delta ABC]= \frac{4}{3}\cdot84=\boxed{112}$.
The diagonals of the rhombus perpendicularly bisect each other
Call half of diagonal BD $a$ and half of diagonal AC $b$
The length of the four sides of the rhombus is $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.
The area of any triangle can be expressed as $\frac{a\cdot b\cdot c}{4R}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides and $R$ is the circumradius
Thus, the area of $\triangle ABD$ is $ab=2a(a^2+b^2)/(4\cdot12.5)$
Also, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $ab=2b(a^2+b^2)/(4\cdot25)$
Setting these two expressions equal to each other and simplifying gives $b=2a$
Substitution yields $a=10$ and $b=20$, so the area of the rhombus is $20\cdot40/2=\boxed{400}$.
Our original solid has volume equal to $V = \frac13 \pi r^2 h = \frac13 \pi 3^2\cdot 4 = 12 \pi$ and has surface area $A = \pi r^2 + \pi r \ell$, where $\ell$ is the slant height of the cone
Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we get $\ell = 5$ and $A = 24\pi$.
Let $x$ denote the radius of the small cone
Let $A_c$ and $A_f$ denote the area of the painted surface on cone $C$ and frustum $F$, respectively, and let $V_c$ and $V_f$ denote the volume of cone $C$ and frustum $F$, respectively
Because the plane cut is parallel to the base of our solid, $C$ is similar to the uncut solid and so the height and slant height of cone $C$ are $\frac{4}{3}x$ and $\frac{5}{3}x$, respectively
Using the formula for lateral surface area of a cone, we find that $A_c=\frac{1}{2}c\cdot \ell=\frac{1}{2}(2\pi x)\left(\frac{5}{3}x\right)=\frac{5}{3}\pi x^2$
By subtracting $A_c$ from the surface area of the original solid, we find that $A_f=24\pi - \frac{5}{3}\pi x^2$.
Next, we can calculate $V_c=\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h=\frac{1}{3}\pi x^2 \left(\frac{4}{3}x\right)=\frac{4}{9}\pi x^3$
Finally, we subtract $V_c$ from the volume of the original cone to find that $V_f=12\pi - \frac{4}{9}\pi x^3$
We know that $\frac{A_c}{A_f}=\frac{V_c}{V_f}=k.$ Plugging in our values for $A_c$, $A_f$, $V_c$, and $V_f$, we obtain the equation $\frac{\frac{5}{3}\pi x^2}{24\pi - \frac{5}{3}\pi x^2}=\frac{\frac{4}{9}\pi x^3}{12\pi - \frac{4}{9}\pi x^3}$
We can take reciprocals of both sides to simplify this equation to $\frac{72}{5x^2} - 1 = \frac{27}{x^3} - 1$ and so $x = \frac{15}{8}$
Then $k = \frac{\frac{5}{3}\pi x^2}{24\pi - \frac{5}{3}\pi x^2}= \frac{125}{387} = \frac mn$ so the answer is $m+n=125+387=\boxed{512}$.

Looking from an overhead view, call the center of the circle $O$, the tether point to the unicorn $A$ and the last point where the rope touches the tower $B$
$\triangle OAB$ is a right triangle because $OB$ is a radius and $BA$ is a tangent line at point $B$
We use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the horizontal component of $AB$ has length $4\sqrt{5}$.

Now look at a side view and "unroll" the cylinder to be a flat surface
Let $C$ be the bottom tether of the rope, let $D$ be the point on the ground below $A$, and let $E$ be the point directly below $B$
Triangles $\triangle CDA$ and $\triangle CEB$ are similar right triangles
By the Pythagorean Theorem $CD=8\cdot\sqrt{6}$.
Let $x$ be the length of $CB$.\[\frac{CA}{CD}=\frac{CB}{CE}\implies \frac{20}{8\sqrt{6}}=\frac{x}{8\sqrt{6}-4\sqrt{5}}\implies x=\frac{60-\sqrt{750}}{3}\]
Therefore $a=60, b=750, c=3, a+b+c=\boxed{813}$.
Every pair of vertices of the polyhedron determines either an edge, a face diagonal or a space diagonal
We have ${26 \choose 2} = \frac{26\cdot25}2 = 325$ total line segments determined by the vertices
Of these, $60$ are edges
Each triangular face has $0$ face diagonals and each quadrilateral face has $2$, so there are $2 \cdot 12 = 24$ face diagonals
This leaves $325 - 60 - 24 = \boxed{241}$ segments to be the space diagonals.
Without loss of generality, let $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$ be the vertices of the square
Suppose the endpoints of the segment lie on the two sides of the square determined by the vertex $(0,0)$
Let the two endpoints of the segment have coordinates $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$
Because the segment has length 2, $x^2+y^2=4$
Using the midpoint formula, we find that the midpoint of the segment has coordinates $\left(\frac{x}{2},\frac{y}{2}\right)$
Let $d$ be the distance from $(0,0)$ to $\left(\frac{x}{2},\frac{y}{2}\right)$
Using the distance formula we see that $d=\sqrt{\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2+\left(\frac{y}{2}\right)^2}= \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}\left(x^2+y^2\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}(4)}=1$
Thus the midpoints lying on the sides determined by vertex $(0,0)$ form a quarter-circle with radius 1.

The set of all midpoints forms a quarter circle at each corner of the square
The area enclosed by all of the midpoints is $4-4\cdot \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)=4-\pi \approx .86$ to the nearest hundredth
Thus $100\cdot k=\boxed{86}$.
The easiest way is to unwrap the cone into a circular sector
Center the sector at the origin with one radius on the positive $x$-axis and the angle $\theta$ going counterclockwise
The circumference of the base is $C=1200\pi$
The sector's radius (cone's sweep) is $R=\sqrt{r^2+h^2}=\sqrt{600^2+(200\sqrt{7})^2}=\sqrt{360000+280000}=\sqrt{640000}=800$
Setting $\theta R=C\implies 800\theta=1200\pi\implies\theta=\frac{3\pi}{2}$.
If the starting point $A$ is on the positive $x$-axis at $(125,0)$ then we can take the end point $B$ on $\theta$'s bisector at $\frac{3\pi}{4}$ radians along the $y=-x$ line in the second quadrant
Using the distance from the vertex puts $B$ at $(-375,375)$
Thus the shortest distance for the fly to travel is along segment $AB$ in the sector, which gives a distance $\sqrt{(-375-125)^2+(375-0)^2}=125\sqrt{4^2+3^2}=\boxed{625}$.
Let the radius of the center circle be $r$ and its center be denoted as $O$.

Clearly line $AO$ passes through the point of tangency of circle $A$ and circle $O$
Let $y$ be the height from the base of the trapezoid to $O$
From the Pythagorean Theorem,\[3^2 + y^2 = (r + 3)^2 \Longrightarrow y = \sqrt {r^2 + 6r}.\]
We use a similar argument with the line $DO$, and find the height from the top of the trapezoid to $O$, $z$, to be $z = \sqrt {r^2 + 4r}$.
Now $y + z$ is simply the height of the trapezoid
Let $D'$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ to $AB$; then $AD' = 3 - 2 = 1$
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $(AD')^2 + (DD')^2 = (AD)^2 \Longrightarrow DD' = \sqrt{24}$ so we need to solve the equation $\sqrt {r^2 + 4r} + \sqrt {r^2 + 6r} = \sqrt {24}$
We can solve this by moving one radical to the other side, and squaring the equation twice to end with a quadratic equation.
Solving this, we get $r = \frac { - 60 + 48\sqrt {3}}{23}$, and the answer is $k + m + n + p = 60 + 48 + 3 + 23 = \boxed{134}$.
Let the intersection of $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{CE}$ be $F$
Since $AB \parallel CE, BC \parallel AD,$ it follows that $ABCF$ is a parallelogram, and so $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle CFA$

By the Law of Cosines, $AC^2 = 3^2 + 5^2 - 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cos 120^{\circ} = 49 \Longrightarrow AC = 7$
Thus the length similarity ratio between $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle EFD$ is $\frac{AC}{ED} = \frac{7}{15}$.
Let $h_{ABC}$ and $h_{BDE}$ be the lengths of the altitudes in $\triangle ABC, \triangle BDE$ to $AC, DE$ respectively
Then, the ratio of the areas $\frac{[ABC]}{[BDE]} = \frac{\frac 12 \cdot h_{ABC} \cdot AC}{\frac 12 \cdot h_{BDE} \cdot DE} = \frac{7}{15} \cdot \frac{h_{ABC}}{h_{BDE}}$.
However, $h_{BDE} = h_{ABC} + h_{CAF} + h_{EFD}$, with all three heights oriented in the same direction
Since $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle CFA$, it follows that $h_{ABC} = h_{CAF}$, and from the similarity ratio, $h_{EFD} = \frac{15}{7}h_{ABC}$
Hence $\frac{h_{ABC}}{h_{BDE}} = \frac{h_{ABC}}{2h_{ABC} + \frac {15}7h_{ABC}} = \frac{7}{29}$, and the ratio of the areas is $\frac{7}{15} \cdot \frac 7{29} = \frac{49}{435}$
The answer is $m+n = \boxed{484}$.

Since $EF$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{BB'}$, it follows that $BE = B'E$ (by SAS)
By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $AB' = 15$
Similarly, from $BF = B'F$, we have\begin{align*} BC^2 + CF^2 = B'D^2 + DF^2 &\Longrightarrow BC^2 + 9 = (BC - 15)^2 + 484 \\ BC  &= \frac{70}{3} \end{align*}Thus the perimeter of $ABCD$ is $2\left(25 + \frac{70}{3}\right) = \frac{290}{3}$, and the answer is $m+n=\boxed{293}$.
The midpoint $M$ of line segment $\overline{BC}$ is $\left(\frac{35}{2}, \frac{39}{2}\right)$
The equation of the median can be found by $-5 = \frac{q - \frac{39}{2}}{p - \frac{35}{2}}$
Cross multiply and simplify to yield that $-5p + \frac{35 \cdot 5}{2} = q - \frac{39}{2}$, so $q = -5p + 107$.
Use determinants to find that the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2} \begin{vmatrix}p & 12 & 23 \\  q & 19 & 20 \\ 1 & 1 & 1\end{vmatrix} = 70$ (note that there is a missing absolute value; we will assume that the other solution for the triangle will give a smaller value of $p+q$, which is provable by following these steps over again)
We can calculate this determinant to become $140 = \begin{vmatrix} 12 & 23 \\ 19 & 20 \end{vmatrix} - \begin{vmatrix} p & q \\ 23 & 20 \end{vmatrix} + \begin{vmatrix} p & q \\ 12 & 19 \end{vmatrix}$ $\Longrightarrow 140 = 240 - 437 - 20p + 23q + 19p - 12q$ $= -197 - p + 11q$
Thus, $q = \frac{1}{11}p - \frac{337}{11}$.
Setting this equation equal to the equation of the median, we get that $\frac{1}{11}p - \frac{337}{11} = -5p + 107$, so $\frac{56}{11}p = \frac{107 \cdot 11 + 337}{11}$
Solving produces that $p = 15$
Substituting backwards yields that $q = 32$; the solution is $p + q = \boxed{47}$.

Then by two applications of the Power of a Point Theorem, $DE^2 = 2m \cdot m = AF^2$, so $DE = AF$
Now, $CE$ and $CF$ are two tangents to a circle from the same point, so by the Two Tangent Theorem $CE = CF = c$ and thus $AC = AF + CF = DE + CE = CD = 10$
Then $DE = AF = AG = 10 - c$ so $BG = BE = BD + DE = 20 - c$ and thus $AB = AG + BG = 30 - 2c$.
Now, by Stewart's Theorem in triangle $\triangle ABC$ with cevian $\overline{AD}$, we have
\[(3m)^2\cdot 20 + 20\cdot10\cdot10 = 10^2\cdot10 + (30 - 2c)^2\cdot 10.\]
Our earlier result from Power of a Point was that $2m^2 = (10 - c)^2$, so we combine these two results to solve for $c$ and we get
\[9(10 - c)^2 + 200 = 100 + (30 - 2c)^2 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad c^2 - 12c + 20 = 0.\]
Thus $c = 2$ or $= 10$
We discard the value $c = 10$ as extraneous (it gives us a line) and are left with $c = 2$, so our triangle has area $\sqrt{28 \cdot 18 \cdot 8 \cdot 2} = 24\sqrt{14}$ and so the answer is $24 + 14 = \boxed{38}$.

Draw line segment $DE$ such that line $DE$ is concurrent with line $BC$
Then, $ABED$ is an isosceles trapezoid so $AD=BE=10$, and $BC=8$ and $EC=2$
We are given that $DC=12$
Since $\angle CED = 120^{\circ}$, using Law of Cosines on $\bigtriangleup CED$ gives\[12^2=DE^2+4-2(2)(DE)(\cos 120^{\circ})\]which gives\[144-4=DE^2+2DE\]
Adding $1$ to both sides gives $141=(DE+1)^2$, so $DE=\sqrt{141}-1$
$\bigtriangleup DAP$ and $\bigtriangleup EBQ$ are both $30-60-90$, so $AP=5$ and $BQ=5$
$PQ=DE$, and therefore $AB=AP+PQ+BQ=5+\sqrt{141}-1+5=9+\sqrt{141} \rightarrow (p,q)=(9,141) \rightarrow \boxed{150}$.

Let the side of the octahedron be of length $s$
Let the vertices of the octahedron be $A, B, C, D, E, F$ so that $A$ and $F$ are opposite each other and $AF = s\sqrt2$
The height of the square pyramid $ABCDE$ is $\frac{AF}2 = \frac s{\sqrt2}$ and so it has volume $\frac 13 s^2 \cdot \frac s{\sqrt2} = \frac {s^3}{3\sqrt2}$ and the whole octahedron has volume $\frac {s^3\sqrt2}3$.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$, $N$ be the midpoint of $DE$, $G$ be the centroid of $\triangle ABC$ and $H$ be the centroid of $\triangle ADE$
Then $\triangle AMN \sim \triangle AGH$ and the symmetry ratio is $\frac 23$ (because the medians of a triangle are trisected by the centroid), so $GH = \frac{2}{3}MN = \frac{2s}3$
$GH$ is also a diagonal of the cube, so the cube has side-length $\frac{s\sqrt2}3$ and volume $\frac{2s^3\sqrt2}{27}$
The ratio of the volumes is then $\frac{\left(\frac{2s^3\sqrt2}{27}\right)}{\left(\frac{s^3\sqrt2}{3}\right)} = \frac29$ and so the answer is $\boxed{11}$.

Let $G$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $O$ to $AB$
Denote $x = EG$ and $y = FG$, and $x > y$ (since $AE < BF$ and $AG = BG$)
Then $\tan \angle EOG = \frac{x}{450}$, and $\tan \angle FOG = \frac{y}{450}$.
By the tangent addition rule $\left( \tan (a + b) = \frac{\tan a + \tan b}{1 - \tan a \tan b} \right)$, we see that\[\tan 45 = \tan (EOG + FOG) = \frac{\frac{x}{450} + \frac{y}{450}}{1 - \frac{x}{450} \cdot \frac{y}{450}}.\]Since $\tan 45 = 1$, this simplifies to $1 - \frac{xy}{450^2} = \frac{x + y}{450}$
We know that $x + y = 400$, so we can substitute this to find that $1 - \frac{xy}{450^2} = \frac 89 \Longrightarrow xy = 150^2$.
Substituting $x = 400 - y$ again, we know have $xy = (400 - y)y = 150^2$
This is a quadratic with roots $200 \pm 50\sqrt{7}$
Since $y < x$, use the smaller root, $200 - 50\sqrt{7}$.
Now, $BF = BG - FG = 450 - (200 - 50\sqrt{7}) = 250 + 50\sqrt{7}$
The answer is $250 + 50 + 7 = \boxed{307}$.
Rewrite the given equations as $(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 256$ and $(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 16$.
Let $w_3$ have center $(x,y)$ and radius $r$
Now, if two circles with radii $r_1$ and $r_2$ are externally tangent, then the distance between their centers is $r_1 + r_2$, and if they are internally tangent, it is $|r_1 - r_2|$
So we have
\begin{align*} r + 4 &= \sqrt{(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\ 16 - r &= \sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \end{align*}
Solving for $r$ in both equations and setting them equal, then simplifying, yields
\begin{align*} 20 - \sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} &= \sqrt{(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\ 20+x &= 2\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \end{align*}
Squaring again and canceling yields $1 = \frac{x^2}{100} + \frac{(y-12)^2}{75}.$
So the locus of points that can be the center of the circle with the desired properties is an ellipse.

Since the center lies on the line $y = ax$, we substitute for $y$ and expand:\[1 = \frac{x^2}{100} + \frac{(ax-12)^2}{75} \Longrightarrow (3+4a^2)x^2 - 96ax + 276 = 0.\]
We want the value of $a$ that makes the line $y=ax$ tangent to the ellipse, which will mean that for that choice of $a$ there is only one solution to the most recent equation
But a quadratic has one solution iff its discriminant is $0$, so $(-96a)^2 - 4(3+4a^2)(276) = 0$.
Solving yields $a^2 = \frac{69}{100}$, so the answer is $\boxed{169}$.

Let $O_1, O_2, O_3$ be the centers and $r_1 = 4, r_2 = 10,r_3 = 14$ the radii of the circles $C_1, C_2, C_3$
Let $T_1, T_2$ be the points of tangency from the common external tangent of $C_1, C_2$, respectively, and let the extension of $\overline{T_1T_2}$ intersect the extension of $\overline{O_1O_2}$ at a point $H$
Let the endpoints of the chord/tangent be $A,B$, and the foot of the perpendicular from $O_3$ to $\overline{AB}$ be $T$
From the similar right triangles $\triangle HO_1T_1 \sim \triangle HO_2T_2 \sim \triangle HO_3T$,
\[\frac{HO_1}{4} = \frac{HO_1+14}{10} = \frac{HO_1+10}{O_3T}.\]
It follows that $HO_1 = \frac{28}{3}$, and that $O_3T = \frac{58}{7}$
By the Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle ATO_3$, we find that
\[AB = 2AT = 2\left(\sqrt{r_3^2 - O_3T^2}\right) = 2\sqrt{14^2 - \frac{58^2}{7^2}} = \frac{8\sqrt{390}}{7}\]
and the answer is $m+n+p=\boxed{405}$.
From the problem statement, we construct the following diagram:

Using the Pythagorean Theorem:
$(AD)^2 = (AC)^2 + (CD)^2$
$(AC)^2 = (AB)^2 + (BC)^2$
Substituting $(AB)^2 + (BC)^2$ for $(AC)^2$:
$(AD)^2 = (AB)^2 + (BC)^2 + (CD)^2$
Plugging in the given information:
$(AD)^2 = (18)^2 + (21)^2 + (14)^2$
$(AD)^2 = 961$
$(AD)= 31$
So the perimeter is $18+21+14+31=84$, and the answer is $\boxed{84}$.
If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular box, we look for the volume $lwh$
We arbitrarily set $lw=24$, $wh=16$, and $lh=6$
Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=24\cdot16\cdot6=2^3\cdot3\cdot2^4\cdot2\cdot3=2^8\cdot3^2$
To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^4\cdot3=\boxed{48}$ cubic inches.

The line passing through the tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right and through the tangency of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it is the line we are looking for: a line passing through the tangency of two circles cuts congruent areas, so our line cuts through the four aforementioned circles splitting into congruent areas, and there are an additional two circles on each side
The line passes through $\left(1,\frac 12\right)$ and $\left(\frac 32,2\right)$, which can be easily solved to be $6x = 2y + 5$
Thus, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = \boxed{65}$.

We will use $[...]$ to denote volume (four letters), area (three letters) or length (two letters).
Let $T$ be the top of the tripod, $A,B,C$ are end points of three legs
Let $S$ be the point on $TA$ such that $[TS] = 4$ and $[SA] = 1$
Let $O$ be the center of the base equilateral triangle $ABC$
Let $M$ be the midpoint of segment $BC$
Let $h$ be the distance from $T$ to the triangle $SBC$ ($h$ is what we want to find).
We have the volume ratio $\frac {[TSBC]}{[TABC]} = \frac {[TS]}{[TA]} = \frac {4}{5}$.
So $\frac {h\cdot [SBC]}{[TO]\cdot [ABC]} = \frac {4}{5}$.
We also have the area ratio $\frac {[SBC]}{[ABC]} = \frac {[SM]}{[AM]}$.
The triangle $TOA$ is a $3-4-5$ right triangle so $[AM] = \frac {3}{2}\cdot[AO] = \frac {9}{2}$ and $\cos{\angle{TAO}} = \frac {3}{5}$.
Applying Law of Cosines to the triangle $SAM$ with $[SA] = 1$, $[AM] = \frac {9}{2}$ and $\cos{\angle{SAM}} = \frac {3}{5}$, we find:
$[SM] = \frac {\sqrt {5\cdot317}}{10}.$
Putting it all together, we find $h = \frac {144}{\sqrt {5\cdot317}}$.
$\lfloor 144+\sqrt{5 \cdot 317}\rfloor =144+ \lfloor \sqrt{5 \cdot 317}\rfloor =144+\lfloor \sqrt{1585} \rfloor =144+39=\boxed{183}$.

Since the sides are parallel, by corresponding angles and AA~ we know that triangles $AA'D'$ and $D'C'E$ are similar
Thus, the sides are proportional: $\frac{AA'}{A'D'} = \frac{D'C'}{C'E} \Longrightarrow \frac{1 - s}{s} = \frac{s}{1 - s - CE}$
Simplifying, we get that $s^2 = (1 - s)(1 - s - CE)$.
$\angle EAF$ is $60$ degrees, so $\angle BAE = \frac{90 - 60}{2} = 15$
Thus, $\cos 15 = \cos (45 - 30) = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4} = \frac{1}{AE}$, so $AE = \frac{4}{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}$
Since $\triangle AEF$ is equilateral, $EF = AE = \sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}$
$\triangle CEF$ is a $45-45-90 \triangle$, so $CE = \frac{AE}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{3} - 1$
Substituting back into the equation from the beginning, we get $s^2 = (1 - s)(2 - \sqrt{3} - s)$, so $(3 - \sqrt{3})s = 2 - \sqrt{3}$
Therefore, $s = \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{3 - \sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{3 + \sqrt{3}} = \frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{6}$, and $a + b + c = 3 + 3 + 6 = \boxed{12}$.
Let $\angle FCD = \alpha$, so that $FB = \sqrt{12^2 + 13^2 + 2\cdot12\cdot13\sin(\alpha)} = \sqrt{433}$
By the diagonal, $DB = 13\sqrt{2}, DB^2 = 338$.
The sum of the squares of the sides of a parallelogram is the sum of the squares of the diagonals.\[EF^2 = 2\cdot(5^2 + 433) - 338 = \boxed{578}.\]
There are $223 \cdot 9 = 2007$ squares in total formed by the rectangle with edges on the x and y axes and with vertices on the intercepts of the equation, since the intercepts of the lines are $(223,0),\ (0,9)$.
Count the number of squares that the diagonal of the rectangle passes through
Since the two diagonals of a rectangle are congruent, we can consider instead the diagonal $y = \frac{223}{9}x$
This passes through 8 horizontal lines ($y = 1 \ldots 8$) and 222 vertical lines ($x = 1 \ldots 222$)
At every time we cross a line, we enter a new square
Since 9 and 223 are relatively prime, we don’t have to worry about crossing an intersection of a horizontal and vertical line at one time
We must also account for the first square
This means that it passes through $222 + 8 + 1 = 231$ squares.
The number of non-diagonal squares is $2007 - 231 = 1776$
Divide this in 2 to get the number of squares in one of the triangles, with the answer being $\frac{1776}2 = \boxed{888}$.

Assuming that $ADE$ is a triangle and applying the triangle inequality, we see that $AD > 20\sqrt {7}$
However, if $AD$ is strictly greater than $20\sqrt {7}$, then the circle with radius $10\sqrt {21}$ and center $A$ does not touch $DC$, which implies that $AC > 10\sqrt {21}$, a contradiction
As a result, A, D, and E are collinear
Therefore, $AD = 20\sqrt {7}$.
Thus, $ADC$ and $ACF$ are $30-60-90$ triangles
Hence $AF = 15\sqrt {7}$, and
$EF = EA + AF = 10\sqrt {7} + 15\sqrt {7} = 25\sqrt {7}$
Finally, the answer is $25+7=\boxed{32}$.

Let $x = OC$
Since $OT, AP \perp TC$, it follows easily that $\triangle APC \sim \triangle OTC$
Thus $\frac{AP}{OT} = \frac{CA}{CO} \Longrightarrow AP = \frac{9(x-9)}{x}$

Thus,\[BP^2 \le 405 + 729 \cdot \frac{1}{27} = \boxed{432}\]Equality holds when $x = 27$.

The length of the perpendicular from $P$ to $MN$ in $\triangle{MNP}$ is $\frac{\sqrt{17}}{\sqrt{2}}$, and the length of the perpendicular from $R$ to $MN$ in $\triangle{MNR}$ is $\frac{\sqrt{51}}{\sqrt{2}}$
Adding those two lengths, $PR=\frac{\sqrt{17}+\sqrt{51}}{\sqrt{2}}$
(Alternatively, we could have used that $\sin 75^{\circ} = \sin (30+45) = \frac{\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2}}{4}$.)
Drop a perpendicular from $R$ to the side of the square containing $M$ and let the intersection be $G$.
\begin{align*}PG&=\frac{PR}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{17}+\sqrt{51}}{2}\\ MG=PG-PM&=\frac{\sqrt{17}+\sqrt{51}}{2}-\sqrt{17}=\frac{\sqrt{51}-\sqrt{17}}{2}\end{align*}

Let $ABCD$ be the smaller square base of the tray and let $A'B'C'D'$ be the larger square, such that $AA'$, etc, are edges
Let $F$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to plane $A'B'C'D'$.
We know $AA'=MR=\sqrt{34}$ and $A'F=MG\sqrt{2}=\frac{\sqrt{51}-\sqrt{17}}{\sqrt{2}}$
Now, use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $AFA'$ to find $AF$:
\begin{align*}\left(\frac{\sqrt{51}-\sqrt{17}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2+AF^2&=\left(\sqrt{34}\right)^2\\ \frac{51-34\sqrt{3}+17}{2}+AF^2&=34\\AF&=\sqrt{34-\frac{68-34\sqrt{3}}{2}}\\AF&=\sqrt{\frac{34\sqrt{3}}{2}}\\AF&=\sqrt[4]{867}\end{align*}
The answer is $867 + 4 = \boxed{871}$.
The path is a circle with radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which is $\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$
Thus, the length of the path is $2\pi\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$.
Also, the length of the path is 17 times the circumference of the base, which is $34r\pi$
Setting these equal gives $\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}} = 17r$, or $h^{2} = 288r^{2}$
Thus, $\dfrac{h^{2}}{r^{2}} = 288$, and $\dfrac{h}{r} = 12\sqrt {2}$, giving an answer of $12 + 2 = \boxed{14}$.
Let $X$ and $Y$ be the points where the folded portion of the triangle crosses $AB,$ and $Z$ be the location of the original vertex $C$ after folding.

We are told that the area of $\triangle XYZ$ is $16\%$ that of the area of $\triangle ABC.$
Now $\triangle ACB$ is similar to $\triangle XZY,$ since $\angle XZY$ is the folded over version of $\angle ACB$ and since $$\angle XYZ=\angle EYB =\angle DEY = \angle CED = \angle CBA$$by parallel lines and folds
Since $\triangle XZY$ is similar to $\triangle ACB$ and its area is $0.16=(0.4)^2$ that of $\triangle ACB,$ the sides of $\triangle XZY$ are $0.4$ times as long as the sides of $\triangle ACB.$
Draw the altitude of $\triangle ACB$ from $C$ down to $P$ on $AB$ (crossing $DE$ at $Q$) and extend it through to $Z.$

Now $CP=CQ+QP=ZQ+QP=ZP+2PQ.$
Since the sides of $\triangle XZY$ are $0.4$ times as long as the sides of $\triangle ACB,$ then $ZP=0.4CP.$
Since $CP=ZP+2PQ,$ we have $PQ=0.3CP,$ and so $CQ=CP-PQ=0.7CP.$
Since $CQ$ is $0.7$ times the length of $CP,$ then $DE$ is $0.7$ times the length of $AB,$ again by similar triangles, so $DE=0.7(12)=\boxed{8.4}\text{ cm}.$

Let $X$ and $Y$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $P$ and $Q$ to $BC$, respectively
Let the radius of $\odot Q$ be $r$
We know that $PQ = r + 16$
From $Q$ draw segment $\overline{QM} \parallel \overline{BC}$ such that $M$ is on $PX$
Clearly, $QM = XY$ and $PM = 16-r$
Also, we know $QPM$ is a right triangle.
To find $XC$, consider the right triangle $PCX$
Since $\odot P$ is tangent to $\overline{AC},\overline{BC}$, then $PC$ bisects $\angle ACB$
Let $\angle ACB = 2\theta$; then $\angle PCX = \angle QBX = \theta$
Dropping the altitude from $A$ to $BC$, we recognize the $7 - 24 - 25$ right triangle, except scaled by $4$.
So we get that $\tan(2\theta) = 24/7$
From the half-angle identity, we find that $\tan(\theta) = \frac {3}{4}$
Therefore, $XC = \frac {64}{3}$
By similar reasoning in triangle $QBY$, we see that $BY = \frac {4r}{3}$.
We conclude that $XY = 56 - \frac {4r + 64}{3} = \frac {104 - 4r}{3}$.
So our right triangle $QPM$ has sides $r + 16$, $r - 16$, and $\frac {104 - 4r}{3}$.
By the Pythagorean Theorem, simplification, and the quadratic formula, we can get $r = 44 - 6\sqrt {35}$, for a final answer of $\boxed{254}$.
Extend $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ to meet at a point $E$
Then $\angle AED = 180 - 53 - 37 = 90^{\circ}$.

As $\angle AED = 90^{\circ}$, note that the midpoint of $\overline{AD}$, $N$, is the center of the circumcircle of $\triangle AED$
We can do the same with the circumcircle about $\triangle BEC$ and $M$ (or we could apply the homothety to find $ME$ in terms of $NE$)
It follows that
\[NE = ND = \frac {AD}{2} = 1004, \quad ME = MC = \frac {BC}{2} = 500.\]
Thus $MN = NE - ME = \boxed{504}$.
For purposes of rigor we will show that $E,M,N$ are collinear
Since $\overline{BC} \parallel \overline{AD}$, then $BC$ and $AD$ are homothetic with respect to point $E$ by a ratio of $\frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{125}{251}$
Since the homothety carries the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$, $M$, to the midpoint of $\overline{AD}$, which is $N$, then $E,M,N$ are collinear.
Let the two points $P$ and $Q$ be defined with coordinates; $P=(x_1,y_1)$ and $Q=(x_2,y_2)$
We can calculate the area of the parallelogram with the determinant of the matrix of the coordinates of the two points(shoelace theorem).
$\det \left(\begin{array}{c} P \\ Q\end{array}\right)=\det \left(\begin{array}{cc}x_1 &y_1\\x_2&y_2\end{array}\right).$
Since the triangle has half the area of the parallelogram, we just need the determinant to be even.
The determinant is
\[(x_1)(y_2)-(x_2)(y_1)=(x_1)(2009-41(x_2))-(x_2)(2009-41(x_1))=2009(x_1)-41(x_1)(x_2)-2009(x_2)+41(x_1)(x_2)=2009((x_1)-(x_2))\]
Since $2009$ is not even, $((x_1)-(x_2))$ must be even, thus the two $x$'s must be of the same parity
Also note that the maximum value for $x$ is $49$ and the minimum is $0$
There are $25$ even and $25$ odd numbers available for use as coordinates and thus there are $(_{25}C_2)+(_{25}C_2)=\boxed{600}$ such triangles.
Let $O$ be center of the circle and $P$,$Q$ be the two points of tangent such that $P$ is on $BI$ and $Q$ is on $AI$
We know that $AD:CD = CD:BD = 12:35$.
Since the ratios between corresponding lengths of two similar diagrams are equal, we can let $AD = 144, CD = 420$ and $BD = 1225$
Hence $AQ = 144, BP = 1225, AB = 1369$ and the radius $r = OD = 210$.
Since we have $\tan OAB = \frac {35}{24}$ and $\tan OBA = \frac{6}{35}$ , we have $\sin {(OAB + OBA)} = \frac {1369}{\sqrt {(1801*1261)}},$$\cos {(OAB + OBA)} = \frac {630}{\sqrt {(1801*1261)}}$.
Hence $\sin I = \sin {(2OAB + 2OBA)} = \frac {2*1369*630}{1801*1261}$
let $IP = IQ = x$ , then we have Area$(IBC)$ = $(2x + 1225*2 + 144*2)*\frac {210}{2}$ = $(x + 144)(x + 1225)* \sin {\frac {I}{2}}$
Then we get $x + 1369 = \frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261}$.
Now the equation looks very complex but we can take a guess here
Assume that $x$ is a rational number (If it's not then the answer to the problem would be irrational which can't be in the form of $\frac {m}{n}$) that can be expressed as $\frac {a}{b}$ such that $(a,b) = 1$
Look at both sides; we can know that $a$ has to be a multiple of $1369$ and not of $3$ and it's reasonable to think that $b$ is divisible by $3$ so that we can cancel out the $3$ on the right side of the equation.
Let's see if $x = \frac {1369}{3}$ fits
Since $\frac {1369}{3} + 1369 = \frac {4*1369}{3}$, and $\frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261} = \frac {3*1369* \frac {1801}{3} * \frac {1261*4}{3}} {1801*1261} = \frac {4*1369}{3}$
Amazingly it fits!
Since we know that $3*1369*144*1225 - 1369*1801*1261 < 0$, the other solution of this equation is negative which can be ignored
Hence $x = 1369/3$.
Hence the perimeter is $1225*2 + 144*2 + \frac {1369}{3} *2 = 1369* \frac {8}{3}$, and $BC$ is $1369$
Hence $\frac {m}{n} = \frac {8}{3}$, $m + n = \boxed{11}$.
First, by the Law of Cosines, we have\[\cos BAC = \frac {16^2 + 10^2 - 14^2}{2\cdot 10 \cdot 16} = \frac {256+100-196}{320} = \frac {1}{2},\]so $\angle BAC = 60^\circ$.
Let $O_1$ and $O_2$ be the circumcenters of triangles $BI_BD$ and $CI_CD$, respectively
We first compute\[\angle BO_1D = \angle BO_1I_B + \angle I_BO_1D = 2\angle BDI_B + 2\angle I_BBD.\]Because $\angle BDI_B$ and $\angle I_BBD$ are half of $\angle BDA$ and $\angle ABD$, respectively, the above expression can be simplified to\[\angle BO_1D = \angle BO_1I_B + \angle I_BO_1D = 2\angle BDI_B + 2\angle I_BBD = \angle ABD + \angle BDA.\]Similarly, $\angle CO_2D = \angle ACD + \angle CDA$
As a result\begin{align*}\angle CPB &= \angle CPD + \angle BPD \\&= \frac {1}{2} \cdot \angle CO_2D + \frac {1}{2} \cdot \angle BO_1D \\&= \frac {1}{2}(\angle ABD + \angle BDA + \angle ACD + \angle CDA) \\&= \frac {1}{2} (2 \cdot 180^\circ - \angle BAC) \\&= \frac {1}{2} \cdot 300^\circ = 150^\circ.\end{align*}
Therefore $\angle CPB$ is constant ($150^\circ$)
Also, $P$ is $B$ or $C$ when $D$ is $B$ or $C$
Let point $L$ be on the same side of $\overline{BC}$ as $A$ with $LC = LB = BC = 14$; $P$ is on the circle with $L$ as the center and $\overline{LC}$ as the radius, which is $14$
The shortest distance from $L$ to $\overline{BC}$ is $7\sqrt {3}$.
When the area of $\triangle BPC$ is the maximum, the distance from $P$ to $\overline{BC}$ has to be the greatest
In this case, it's $14 - 7\sqrt {3}$
The maximum area of $\triangle BPC$ is\[\frac {1}{2} \cdot 14 \cdot (14 - 7\sqrt {3}) = 98 - 49 \sqrt {3}\]and the requested answer is $98 + 49 + 3 = \boxed{150}$.
One of the ways to solve this problem is to make this parallelogram a straight line
So the whole length of the line is $APC$($AMC$ or $ANC$), and $ABC$ is $1000x+2009x=3009x.$
$AP$($AM$ or $AN$) is $17x.$
So the answer is $3009x/17x = \boxed{177}$

Since $K$ is the midpoint of $\overline{PM}$ and $\overline{AC}$, quadrilateral $AMCP$ is a parallelogram, which implies $AM||LP$ and $\bigtriangleup{AMB}$ is similar to $\bigtriangleup{LPB}$
\[\frac {AM}{LP}=\frac {AB}{LB}=\frac {AL+LB}{LB}=\frac {AL}{LB}+1\]
Now let's apply the angle bisector theorem.
\[\frac {AL}{LB}=\frac {AC}{BC}=\frac {450}{300}=\frac {3}{2}\]
\[\frac {AM}{LP}=\frac {AL}{LB}+1=\frac {5}{2}\]
\[\frac {180}{LP}=\frac {5}{2}\]
\[LP=\boxed{072}\].
Let $V = \overline{NM} \cap \overline{AC}$ and $W = \overline{NM} \cap \overline{BC}$
Further more let $\angle NMC = \alpha$ and $\angle MNC = 90^\circ - \alpha$
Angle chasing reveals $\angle NBC = \angle NAC = \alpha$ and $\angle MBC = \angle MAC = 90^\circ - \alpha$
Additionally $NB = \frac{4}{5}$ and $AN = AM$ by the Pythagorean Theorem.
By the Angle Bisector Formula,\[\frac{NV}{MV} = \frac{\sin (\alpha)}{\sin (90^\circ - \alpha)} = \tan (\alpha)\]\[\frac{MW}{NW} = \frac{3\sin (90^\circ - \alpha)}{4\sin (\alpha)} = \frac{3}{4} \cot (\alpha)\]
As $NV + MV =MW + NW = 1$ we compute $NW = \frac{1}{1+\frac{3}{4}\cot(\alpha)}$ and $MV = \frac{1}{1+\tan (\alpha)}$, and finally $VW = NW + MV - 1 =  \frac{1}{1+\frac{3}{4}\cot(\alpha)} + \frac{1}{1+\tan (\alpha)} - 1$
Taking the derivative of $VW$ with respect to $\alpha$, we arrive at\[VW' = \frac{7\cos^2 (\alpha) - 4}{(\sin(\alpha) + \cos(\alpha))^2(4\sin(\alpha)+3\cos(\alpha))^2}\]Clearly the maximum occurs when $\alpha = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}\right)$
Plugging this back in, using the fact that $\tan(\cos^{-1}(x)) = \frac{\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}$ and $\cot(\cos^{-1}(x)) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$, we get
$VW = 7 - 4\sqrt{3}$ with $7 + 4 + 3 = \boxed{14}$

From the problem, $AB=100$ and triangle $FBA$ is a right triangle
As $ABCD$ is a rectangle, triangles $BCA$, and $ABE$ are also right triangles
By $AA$, $\triangle FBA \sim \triangle BCA$, and $\triangle FBA \sim \triangle ABE$, so $\triangle ABE \sim \triangle BCA$
This gives $\frac {AE}{AB}= \frac {AB}{BC}$
$AE=\frac{AD}{2}$ and $BC=AD$, so $\frac {AD}{2AB}= \frac {AB}{AD}$, or $(AD)^2=2(AB)^2$, so $AD=AB \sqrt{2}$, or $100 \sqrt{2}$, so the answer is $\boxed{141}$.
Let $X$ be the intersection of the circles with centers $B$ and $E$, and $Y$ be the intersection of the circles with centers $C$ and $E$
Since the radius of $B$ is $3$, $AX =4$
Assume $AE$ = $p$
Then $EX$ and $EY$ are radii of circle $E$ and have length $4+p$
$AC = 8$, and angle $CAE = 60$ degrees because we are given that triangle $T$ is equilateral
Using the Law of Cosines on triangle $CAE$, we obtain
$(6+p)^2 =p^2 + 64 - 2(8)(p) \cos 60$.
The $2$ and the $\cos 60$ terms cancel out:
$p^2 + 12p +36 = p^2 + 64 - 8p$
$12p+ 36 = 64 - 8p$
$p =\frac {28}{20} = \frac {7}{5}$
The radius of circle $E$ is $4 + \frac {7}{5} = \frac {27}{5}$, so the answer is $27 + 5 = \boxed{32}$.
Since all edges of pyramid $SPQR$ have length $18$ or $41$, each triangular face must be isosceles: either $18$-$18$-$41$ or $18$-$41$-$41$
But the first of these two sets of side lengths violates the triangle inequality, since $18+18<41$
Therefore, every face of $SPQR$ must have sides of lengths $18,$ $41,$ and $41$.
To find the area of each face, we draw an $18$-$41$-$41$ triangle with altitude $h$: [asy]
size(4cm);
pair a=(0,40); pair b=(-9,0); pair c=(9,0); pair o=(0,0);
dot(a); dot(b); dot(c); draw(a--b--c--a); draw(a--o,dashed); draw(rightanglemark(a,o,c,60));
label("$h$",(a+2*o)/3,SE);
label("$41$",(a+c)/2,E);
label("$9$",(o+c)/2,N);
label("$41$",(a+b)/2,W);
label("$9$",(o+b)/2,N);
[/asy] Since the triangle is isosceles, we know the altitude bisects the base (as marked above)
By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $9^2+h^2=41^2$ and thus $h=40$
So, the triangle has area $\frac 12\cdot 18\cdot 40 = 360$.
The surface area of pyramid $SPQR$ is made up of four such triangles, so it amounts to $4\cdot 360 = \boxed{1440}$.
${\bf Remark.}$  One might wonder whether a pyramid with the properties enumerated in the problem actually exists
The answer is yes! To form such a pyramid, imagine attaching two $18$-$41$-$41$ triangles (like that in the diagram) along their short edges, so that the triangles are free to rotate around that hinge: [asy]
import three;
triple a=(9,0,0); triple b=-a; triple c=(0,sqrt(1519),-9); triple d=(0,sqrt(1519),9);
dot(a); dot(b); dot(c); dot(d);
draw(surface(a--b--c--cycle),orange,nolight);
draw(b--c--a);
draw(surface(a--b--d--cycle),yellow,nolight);
draw(b--d--a--b);
draw(c--d,dashed);
[/asy] Now you can adjust the distance between the two "free" vertices (the dotted line in the diagram above) so that it is $18$
Adding that edge to the diagram and filling in, we have a pyramid with the desired properties.
[asy]size(280); import graph; real min = 2, max = 12; pen dark = linewidth(1);   real P(real x) { return x/3 + 5; } real Q(real x) { return 10 - abs(x - 8); } path p = (2,P(2))--(8,P(8))--(12,P(12)), q = (2,Q(2))--(12,Q(12)); pair A = (8,10), B = (4.5,6.5), C= (9.75,8.25), F=foot(A,B,C), G=2*F-A; fill(A--B--C--cycle,rgb(0.9,0.9,0.9));  draw(graph(P,min,max),dark); draw(graph(Q,min,max),dark); draw(Arc((8,7.67),A,G,CW),dark,EndArrow(8)); draw(B--C--G--cycle,linetype("4 4"));  label("$y \ge x/3 + 5$",(max,P(max)),E,fontsize(10)); label("$y \le 10 - |x-8|$",(max,Q(max)),E,fontsize(10)); label("$\mathcal{R}$",(6,Q(6)),NW);   /* axes */ Label f; f.p=fontsize(8); xaxis(0, max, Ticks(f, 6, 1)); yaxis(0, 10, Ticks(f, 5, 1));  [/asy]
The inequalities are equivalent to $y \ge x/3 + 5, y \le 10 - |x - 8|$
We can set them equal to find the two points of intersection, $x/3 + 5 = 10 - |x - 8| \Longrightarrow |x - 8| = 5 - x/3$
This implies that one of $x - 8, 8 - x = 5 - x/3$, from which we find that $(x,y) = \left(\frac 92, \frac {13}2\right), \left(\frac{39}{4}, \frac{33}{4}\right)$
The region $\mathcal{R}$ is a triangle, as shown above
When revolved about the line $y = x/3+5$, the resulting solid is the union of two right cones that share the same base and axis.
[asy]size(200); import three; currentprojection = perspective(0,0,10); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)); pen dark=linewidth(1.3); pair Fxy = foot((8,10),(4.5,6.5),(9.75,8.25)); triple A = (8,10,0), B = (4.5,6.5,0), C= (9.75,8.25,0), F=(Fxy.x,Fxy.y,0), G=2*F-A, H=(F.x,F.y,abs(F-A)),I=(F.x,F.y,-abs(F-A)); real theta1 = 1.2, theta2 = -1.7,theta3= abs(F-A),theta4=-2.2;  triple J=F+theta1*unit(A-F)+(0,0,((abs(F-A))^2-(theta1)^2)^.5 ),K=F+theta2*unit(A-F)+(0,0,((abs(F-A))^2-(theta2)^2)^.5 ),L=F+theta3*unit(A-F)+(0,0,((abs(F-A))^2-(theta3)^2)^.5 ),M=F+theta4*unit(A-F)-(0,0,((abs(F-A))^2-(theta4)^2)^.5 ); draw(C--A--B--G--cycle,linetype("4 4")+dark); draw(A..H..G..I..A); draw(C--B^^A--G,linetype("4 4")); draw(J--C--K); draw(L--B--M); dot(B);dot(C);dot(F);  label("$h_1$",(B+F)/2,SE,fontsize(10)); label("$h_2$",(C+F)/2,S,fontsize(10)); label("$r$",(A+F)/2,E,fontsize(10)); [/asy]
Let $h_1,h_2$ denote the height of the left and right cones, respectively (so $h_1 > h_2$), and let $r$ denote their common radius
The volume of a cone is given by $\frac 13 Bh$; since both cones share the same base, then the desired volume is $\frac 13 \cdot \pi r^2 \cdot (h_1 + h_2)$
The distance from the point $(8,10)$ to the line $x - 3y + 15 = 0$ is given by $\left|\frac{(8) - 3(10) + 15}{\sqrt{1^2 + (-3)^2}}\right| = \frac{7}{\sqrt{10}}$
The distance between $\left(\frac 92, \frac {13}2\right)$ and $\left(\frac{39}{4}, \frac{33}{4}\right)$ is given by $h_1 + h_2 = \sqrt{\left(\frac{18}{4} - \frac{39}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{26}{4} - \frac{33}{4}\right)^2} = \frac{7\sqrt{10}}{4}$
Thus, the answer is $\frac{343\sqrt{10}\pi}{120} = \frac{343\pi}{12\sqrt{10}} \Longrightarrow 343 + 12 + 10 = \boxed{365}$.
The center of the semicircle is also the midpoint of $AB$
Let this point be O
Let $h$ be the length of $AD$.
Rescale everything by 42, so $AU = 2, AN = 3, UB = 4$
Then $AB = 6$ so $OA = OB = 3$.
Since $ON$ is a radius of the semicircle, $ON = 3$
Thus $OAN$ is an equilateral triangle.
Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be the areas of triangle $OUN$, sector $ONB$, and trapezoid $UBCT$ respectively.
$X = \frac {1}{2}(UO)(NO)\sin{O} = \frac {1}{2}(1)(3)\sin{60^\circ} = \frac {3}{4}\sqrt {3}$
$Y = \frac {1}{3}\pi(3)^2 = 3\pi$
To find $Z$ we have to find the length of $TC$
Project $T$ and $N$ onto $AB$ to get points $T'$ and $N'$
Notice that $UNN'$ and $TUT'$ are similar
$\frac {TT'}{UT'} = \frac {UN'}{NN'} \implies \frac {TT'}{h} = \frac {1/2}{3\sqrt {3}/2} \implies TT' = \frac {\sqrt {3}}{9}h$.
Then $TC = T'C - T'T = UB - TT' = 4 - \frac {\sqrt {3}}{9}h$
$Z = \frac {1}{2}(BU + TC)(CB) = \frac {1}{2}\left(8 - \frac {\sqrt {3}}{9}h\right)h = 4h - \frac {\sqrt {3}}{18}h^2$
Let $L$ be the area of the side of line $l$ containing regions $X, Y, Z$
$L = X + Y + Z = \frac {3}{4}\sqrt {3} + 3\pi + 4h - \frac {\sqrt {3}}{18}h^2$
Obviously, the $L$ is greater than the area on the other side of line $l$
This other area is equal to the total area minus $L$
$\frac {2}{1} = \frac {L}{6h + \frac {9}{2}{\pi} - L} \implies 12h + 9\pi = 3L$.
Now just solve for $h$.
\begin{align*} 12h + 9\pi & = \frac {9}{4}\sqrt {3} + 9\pi + 12h - \frac {\sqrt {3}}{6}h^2 \\ 0 & = \frac {9}{4}\sqrt {3} - \frac {\sqrt {3}}{6}h^2 \\ h^2 & = \frac {9}{4}(6) \\ h & = \frac {3}{2}\sqrt {6} \end{align*}
Don't forget to un-rescale at the end to get $AD = \frac {3}{2}\sqrt {6} \cdot 42 = 63\sqrt {6}$.
Finally, the answer is $63 + 6 = \boxed{69}$.

Let $AM = x$, then $CM = 15 - x$
Also let $BM = d$ Clearly, $\frac {[ABM]}{[CBM]} = \frac {x}{15 - x}$
We can also express each area by the rs formula
Then $\frac {[ABM]}{[CBM]} = \frac {p(ABM)}{p(CBM)} = \frac {12 + d + x}{28 + d - x}$
Equating and cross-multiplying yields $25x + 2dx = 15d + 180$ or $d = \frac {25x - 180}{15 - 2x}.$ Note that for $d$ to be positive, we must have $7.2 < x < 7.5$.
By Stewart's Theorem, we have $12^2(15 - x) + 13^2x = d^215 + 15x(15 - x)$ or $432 = 3d^2 + 40x - 3x^2.$ Brute forcing by plugging in our previous result for $d$, we have $432 = \frac {3(25x - 180)^2}{(15 - 2x)^2} + 40x - 3x^2.$ Clearing the fraction and gathering like terms, we get $0 = 12x^4 - 340x^3 + 2928x^2 - 7920x.$
Aside: Since $x$ must be rational in order for our answer to be in the desired form, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to reveal that $12x$ is an integer
The only such $x$ in the above-stated range is $\frac {22}3$.
Legitimately solving that quartic, note that $x = 0$ and $x = 15$ should clearly be solutions, corresponding to the sides of the triangle and thus degenerate cevians
Factoring those out, we get $0 = 4x(x - 15)(3x^2 - 40x + 132) = x(x - 15)(x - 6)(3x - 22).$ The only solution in the desired range is thus $\frac {22}3$
Then $CM = \frac {23}3$, and our desired ratio $\frac {AM}{CM} = \frac {22}{23}$, giving us an answer of $\boxed{45}$.
Let the first triangle have side lengths $a$, $a$, $14c$, and the second triangle have side lengths $b$, $b$, $16c$, where $a, b, 2c \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Equal perimeter:
$\begin{array}{ccc} 2a+14c&=&2b+16c\\ a+7c&=&b+8c\\ c&=&a-b\\ \end{array}$
Equal Area:
$\begin{array}{cccl} 7c(\sqrt{a^2-(7c)^2})&=&8c(\sqrt{b^2-(8c)^2})&{}\\ 7(\sqrt{(a+7c)(a-7c)})&=&8(\sqrt{(b+8c)(b-8c)})&{}\\ 7(\sqrt{(a-7c)})&=&8(\sqrt{(b-8c)})&\text{(Note that } a+7c=b+8c)\\ 49a-343c&=&64b-512c&{}\\ 49a+169c&=&64b&{}\\ 49a+169(a-b)&=&64b&\text{(Note that } c=a-b)\\ 218a&=&233b&{}\\ \end{array}$
Since $a$ and $b$ are integer, the minimum occurs when $a=233$, $b=218$, and $c=15$
Hence, the perimeter is $2a+14c=2(233)+14(15)=\boxed{676}$.
Let $O$ be the circumcenter of $ABC$ and let the intersection of $CP$ with the circumcircle be $D$
It now follows that $\angle{DOA} = 2\angle ACP = \angle{APC} = \angle{DPB}$
Hence $ODP$ is isosceles and $OD = DP = 2$.
Denote $E$ the projection of $O$ onto $CD$
Now $CD = CP + DP = 3$
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OE = \sqrt {2^2 - \frac {3^2}{2^2}} = \sqrt {\frac {7}{4}}$
Now note that $EP = \frac {1}{2}$
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OP = \sqrt {\frac {7}{4} + \frac {1^2}{2^2}} = \sqrt {2}$
Hence it now follows that,
\[\frac {AP}{BP} = \frac {AO + OP}{BO - OP} = \frac {2 + \sqrt {2}}{2 - \sqrt {2}} = 3 + 2\sqrt {2}\]
This gives that the answer is $\boxed{7}$.

Let $M$ be the intersection of $\overline{AH}$ and $\overline{BI}$
and $N$ be the intersection of $\overline{BI}$ and $\overline{CJ}$.
Let $O$ be the center.
Let $BC=2$ (without loss of generality).
Note that $\angle BMH$ is the vertical angle to an angle of regular hexagon, and so has degree $120^\circ$.
Because $\triangle ABH$ and $\triangle BCI$ are rotational images of one another, we get that $\angle{MBH}=\angle{HAB}$ and hence $\triangle ABH \sim \triangle BMH \sim \triangle BCI$.
Using a similar argument, $NI=MH$, and
\[MN=BI-NI-BM=BI-(BM+MH).\]
Applying the Law of cosines on $\triangle BCI$, $BI=\sqrt{2^2+1^2-2(2)(1)(\cos(120^\circ))}=\sqrt{7}$
\begin{align*}\frac{BC+CI}{BI}&=\frac{3}{\sqrt{7}}=\frac{BM+MH}{BH} \\ BM+MH&=\frac{3BH}{\sqrt{7}}=\frac{3}{\sqrt{7}} \\ MN&=BI-(BM+MH)=\sqrt{7}-\frac{3}{\sqrt{7}}=\frac{4}{\sqrt{7}} \\ \frac{\text{Area of smaller hexagon}}{\text{Area of bigger hexagon}}&=\left(\frac{MN}{BC}\right)^2=\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}\right)^2=\frac{4}{7}\end{align*}
Thus, the answer is $4 + 7 = \boxed{11}$.
Extend ${CM}$ and ${CN}$ such that they intersect line ${AB}$ at points $P$ and $Q$, respectively
Since ${BM}$ is the angle bisector of angle $B$, and ${CM}$ is perpendicular to ${BM}$, so $BP=BC=120$, and $M$ is the midpoint of ${CP}$
For the same reason, $AQ=AC=117$, and $N$ is the midpoint of ${CQ}$
Hence $MN=\frac{PQ}{2}$
$PQ=BP+AQ-AB=120+117-125=112$, so $MN=\boxed{56}$.
Note that the area is given by Heron's formula and it is $20\sqrt{221}$
Let $h_i$ denote the length of the altitude dropped from vertex i
It follows that $h_b = \frac{40\sqrt{221}}{27}, h_c  = \frac{40\sqrt{221}}{30}, h_a = \frac{40\sqrt{221}}{23}$
From similar triangles we can see that $\frac{27h}{h_a}+\frac{27h}{h_c} \le 27 \rightarrow h \le \frac{h_ah_c}{h_a+h_c}$
We can see this is true for any combination of a,b,c and thus the minimum of the upper bounds for h yields $h = \frac{40\sqrt{221}}{57} \rightarrow \boxed{318}$.
Let $E$ and $F$ be the midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$, respectively, such that $\overline{BE}$ intersects $\overline{CF}$.
Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints, $BE = 15$ and $CF = 7$.
$B$ and $C$ are located on the circumference of the circle, so $OB = OC = 25$.
The line through the midpoint of a chord of a circle and the center of that circle is perpendicular to that chord, so $\triangle OEB$ and $\triangle OFC$ are right triangles (with $\angle OEB$ and $\angle OFC$ being the right angles)
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OE = \sqrt{25^2 - 15^2} = 20$, and $OF = \sqrt{25^2 - 7^2} = 24$.
Let $x$, $a$, and $b$ be lengths $OP$, $EP$, and $FP$, respectively
OEP and OFP are also right triangles, so $x^2 = a^2 + 20^2 \to a^2 = x^2 - 400$, and $x^2 = b^2 + 24^2 \to b^2 = x^2 - 576$
We are given that $EF$ has length 12, so, using the Law of Cosines with $\triangle EPF$:
$12^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos (\angle EPF) = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos (\angle EPO + \angle FPO)$
Substituting for $a$ and $b$, and applying the Cosine of Sum formula:
$144 = (x^2 - 400) + (x^2 - 576) - 2 \sqrt{x^2 - 400} \sqrt{x^2 - 576} \left( \cos \angle EPO \cos \angle FPO - \sin \angle EPO \sin \angle FPO \right)$
$\angle EPO$ and $\angle FPO$ are acute angles in right triangles, so substitute opposite/hypotenuse for sines and adjacent/hypotenuse for cosines:
$144 = 2x^2 - 976 - 2 \sqrt{(x^2 - 400)(x^2 - 576)} \left(\frac{\sqrt{x^2 - 400}}{x} \frac{\sqrt{x^2 - 576}}{x} - \frac{20}{x} \frac{24}{x} \right)$
Combine terms and multiply both sides by $x^2$: $144 x^2 = 2 x^4 - 976 x^2 - 2 (x^2 - 400) (x^2 - 576) + 960  \sqrt{(x^2 - 400)(x^2 - 576)}$
Combine terms again, and divide both sides by 64: $13 x^2 = 7200 - 15 \sqrt{x^4 - 976 x^2 + 230400}$
Square both sides: $169 x^4 - 187000 x^2 + 51,840,000 = 225 x^4 - 219600 x^2 + 51,840,000$
This reduces to $x^2 = \frac{4050}{7} = (OP)^2$; $4050 + 7 \equiv \boxed{57} \pmod{1000}$.
The circumference of the front wheel is $2\pi \cdot 2.5=5\pi$ feet
In 100 revolutions, the front wheel travels $5\pi \cdot 100 = 500\pi$ feet
The back wheel must travel the same distance because they are both attached to the same bike
The circumference of the back wheel is $2\pi \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}\pi$ feet (note that 4 inches is equal to $\frac{1}{3}$ feet)
Thus, the number of revolutions of the back wheel is $\frac{500\pi}{\frac{2}{3}\pi}=\boxed{750}$.
Denote the midpoint of $\overline{DC}$ be $E$ and the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ be $F$
Because they are the circumcenters, both Os lie on the perpendicular bisectors of $AB$ and $CD$ and these bisectors go through $E$ and $F$.
It is given that $\angle O_{1}PO_{2}=120^{\circ}$
Because $O_{1}P$ and $O_{1}B$ are radii of the same circle, the have the same length
This is also true of $O_{2}P$ and $O_{2}D$
Because $m\angle CAB=m\angle ACD=45^{\circ}$, $m\stackrel{\frown}{PD}=m\stackrel{\frown}{PB}=2(45^{\circ})=90^{\circ}$
Thus, $O_{1}PB$ and $O_{2}PD$ are isosceles right triangles
Using the given information above and symmetry, $m\angle DPB = 120^{\circ}$
Because ABP and ADP share one side, have one side with the same length, and one equal angle, they are congruent by SAS
This is also true for triangle CPB and CPD
Because angles APB and APD are equal and they sum to 120 degrees, they are each 60 degrees
Likewise, both angles CPB and CPD have measures of 120 degrees.
Because the interior angles of a triangle add to 180 degrees, angle ABP has measure 75 degrees and angle PDC has measure 15 degrees
Subtracting, it is found that both angles $O_{1}BF$ and $O_{2}DE$ have measures of 30 degrees
Thus, both triangles $O_{1}BF$ and $O_{2}DE$ are 30-60-90 right triangles
Because F and E are the midpoints of AB and CD respectively, both FB and DE have lengths of 6
Thus, $DO_{2}=BO_{1}=4\sqrt{3}$
Because of 45-45-90 right triangles, $PB=PD=4\sqrt{6}$.
Now, letting $x = AP$ and using Law of Cosines on $\triangle ABP$, we have
\[96=144+x^{2}-24x\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\]\[0=x^{2}-12x\sqrt{2}+48\]
Using the quadratic formula, we arrive at
\[x = \sqrt{72} \pm \sqrt{24}\]
Taking the positive root, $AP=\sqrt{72}+ \sqrt{24}$ and the answer is thus $\boxed{96}$.

Therefore, ($x$ being the side length), $\sqrt{x^2+(x/3)^2}=30$, or $x^2+(x/3)^2=900$
Solving for $x$, we get $x=9\sqrt{10}$, and $x^2=810.$
Area of the square is $\boxed{810}$.
The average angle in an 18-gon is $160^\circ$
In an arithmetic sequence the average is the same as the median, so the middle two terms of the sequence average to $160^\circ$
Thus for some positive (the sequence is increasing and thus non-constant) integer $d$, the middle two terms are $(160-d)^\circ$ and $(160+d)^\circ$
Since the step is $2d$ the last term of the sequence is $(160 + 17d)^\circ$, which must be less than $180^\circ$, since the polygon is convex
This gives $17d < 20$, so the only suitable positive integer $d$ is 1
The first term is then $(160-17)^\circ = \boxed{143}.$

It follows that $\triangle BPC \sim \triangle DD'C$, so\[\frac{PC}{D'C} = 1 + \frac{BD}{DC} = 1 + \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{31}{11}\]by the Angle Bisector Theorem
Similarly, we see by the Midline Theorem that $AP = PD'$
Thus,\[\frac{CP}{PA} = \frac{1}{\frac{PD'}{PC}} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{D'C}{PC}} = \frac{31}{20},\]and $m+n = \boxed{51}$.
Use the angle bisector theorem to find $CD=\frac{21}{8}$, $BD=\frac{35}{8}$, and use Stewart's Theorem to find $AD=\frac{15}{8}$
Use Power of the Point to find $DE=\frac{49}{8}$, and so $AE=8$
Use law of cosines to find $\angle CAD = \frac{\pi} {3}$, hence $\angle BAD = \frac{\pi}{3}$ as well, and $\triangle BCE$ is equilateral, so $BC=CE=BE=7$.
I'm sure there is a more elegant solution from here, but instead we'll do some hairy law of cosines:
$AE^2 = AF^2 + EF^2 - 2 \cdot AF \cdot EF \cdot \cos \angle AFE.$ (1)
$AF^2 = AE^2 + EF^2 - 2 \cdot AE \cdot EF \cdot \cos \angle AEF.$ Adding these two and simplifying we get:
$EF = AF \cdot \cos \angle AFE + AE \cdot \cos \angle AEF$ (2)
Ah, but $\angle AFE = \angle ACE$ (since $F$ lies on $\omega$), and we can find $cos \angle ACE$ using the law of cosines:
$AE^2 = AC^2 + CE^2 - 2 \cdot AC \cdot CE \cdot \cos \angle ACE$, and plugging in $AE = 8, AC = 3, BE = BC = 7,$ we get $\cos \angle ACE = -1/7 = \cos \angle AFE$.
Also, $\angle AEF = \angle DEF$, and $\angle DFE = \pi/2$ (since $F$ is on the circle $\gamma$ with diameter $DE$), so $\cos \angle AEF = EF/DE = 8 \cdot EF/49$.
Plugging in all our values into equation (2), we get:
$EF = -\frac{AF}{7} + 8 \cdot \frac{8EF}{49}$, or $EF = \frac{7}{15} \cdot AF$.
Finally, we plug this into equation (1), yielding:
$8^2 = AF^2 + \frac{49}{225} \cdot AF^2 - 2 \cdot AF \cdot \frac{7AF}{15} \cdot \frac{-1}{7}$
$64 = \frac{AF^2}{225} \cdot (225+49+30),$ or $AF^2 = \frac{900}{19}.$ The answer is $\boxed{919}$.
Let the height of the box be $x$.
After using the Pythagorean Theorem three times, we can quickly see that the sides of the triangle are 10, $\sqrt{\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 + 64}$, and $\sqrt{\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 + 36}$
Since the area of the triangle is $30$, the altitude of the triangle from the base with length $10$ is $6$.
Considering the two triangles created by the altitude, we use the Pythagorean theorem twice to find the lengths of the two line segments that make up the base of $10$.
We find:\[10 = \sqrt{\left(28+x^2/4\right)}+x/2\]
Solving for $x$ gives us $x=\frac{36}{5}$
Since this fraction is simplified:\[m+n=\boxed{41}\]
Let $P$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $\overline{CR}$, so $\overline{AP}\parallel\overline{EM}$
Since triangle $ARC$ is isosceles, $P$ is the midpoint of $\overline{CR}$, and $\overline{PM}\parallel\overline{CD}$
Thus, $APME$ is a parallelogram and $AE = PM = \frac{CD}{2}$
We can then use coordinates
Let $O$ be the foot of altitude $RO$ and set $O$ as the origin
Now we notice special right triangles! In particular, $DO = \frac{1}{2}$ and $EO = RO = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $D\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)$, $E\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, 0\right)$, and $R\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right).$ $M =$ midpoint$(D, R) = \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)$ and the slope of $ME = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}}{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{1 + 2\sqrt{3}}$, so the slope of $RC = -\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}.$ Instead of finding the equation of the line, we use the definition of slope: for every $CO = x$ to the left, we go $\frac{x(1 + 2\sqrt{3})}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ up
Thus, $x = \frac{\frac{3}{2}}{1 + 2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3}{4\sqrt{3} + 2} = \frac{3(4\sqrt{3} - 2)}{44} = \frac{6\sqrt{3} - 3}{22}.$ $DC = \frac{1}{2} - x = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{6\sqrt{3} - 3}{22} = \frac{14 - 6\sqrt{3}}{22}$, and $AE = \frac{7 - \sqrt{27}}{22}$, so the answer is $\boxed{56}$.

Let us just drop the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$ and label the point of intersection $O$
We will use this point later in the problem
As we can see,
$M$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and $N$ is the midpoint of $HM$
$AHC$ is a $45-45-90$ triangle, so $\angle{HAB}=15^\circ$.
$AHD$ is $30-60-90$ triangle.
$AH$ and $PN$ are parallel lines so $PND$ is $30-60-90$ triangle also.
Then if we use those informations we get $AD=2HD$ and
$PD=2ND$ and $AP=AD-PD=2HD-2ND=2HN$ or $AP=2HN=HM$
Now we know that $HM=AP$, we can find for $HM$ which is simpler to find.
We can use point $B$ to split it up as $HM=HB+BM$,
We can chase those lengths and we would get
$AB=10$, so $OB=5$, so $BC=5\sqrt{2}$, so $BM=\dfrac{1}{2} \cdot BC=\dfrac{5\sqrt{2}}{2}$
We can also use Law of Sines:
\[\frac{BC}{AB}=\frac{\sin\angle A}{\sin\angle C}\]\[\frac{BC}{10}=\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}\implies BC=5\sqrt{2}\]
Then using right triangle $AHB$, we have $HB=10 \sin 15^\circ$
So $HB=10 \sin 15^\circ=\dfrac{5(\sqrt{6}-\sqrt{2})}{2}$.
And we know that $AP = HM = HB + BM = \frac{5(\sqrt6-\sqrt2)}{2} + \frac{5\sqrt2}{2} = \frac{5\sqrt6}{2}$.
Finally if we calculate $(AP)^2$.
$(AP)^2=\dfrac{150}{4}=\dfrac{75}{2}$
So our final answer is $75+2=77$.
$m+n=\boxed{77}$.
First of all, suppose $X, P, Q, Y$ lie in that order

[/asy] Let $PX = x$ and $QY = y$
By power of a point from $P$, $x\cdot(27+y) = 30$, and by power of a point from $Q$, $y\cdot(27+x) = 84$
Subtracting the first from the second, $27\cdot(y-x) = 54$, so $y = x+2$
Now, $x\cdot(29+x) = 30$, and we find $x = 1, -30$
Since $-30$ makes no sense, we take $x = 1$ and obtain $XY = 1 + 27 + 3 = \boxed{31}.$

Using the diagram above, let the radius of $D$ be $3r$, and the radius of $E$ be $r$
Then, $EF=r$, and $CE=2-r$, so the Pythagorean theorem in $\triangle CEF$ gives $CF=\sqrt{4-4r}$
Also, $CD=CA-AD=2-3r$, so\[DF=DC+CF=2-3r+\sqrt{4-4r}.\]Noting that $DE=4r$, we can now use the Pythagorean theorem in $\triangle DEF$ to get\[(2-3r+\sqrt{4-4r})^2+r^2=16r^2.\]
Solving this quadratic is somewhat tedious, but the constant terms cancel, so the computation isn't terrible
Solving gives $3r=\sqrt{240}-14$ for a final answer of $\boxed{254}$.
Notice that C, E and the point of tangency to circle C for circle E will be concurrent because C and E intersect the tangent line at a right angle, implying they must be on the same line.
Let $D$ be the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$
Then by SAS Congruence, $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle ACD$, so $\angle ADB = \angle ADC = 90^o$.
Now let $BD=y$, $AB=x$, and $\angle IBD = \dfrac{\angle ABD}{2} = \theta$.
Then $\mathrm{cos}{(\theta)} = \dfrac{y}{8}$
and $\mathrm{cos}{(2\theta)} = \dfrac{y}{x} = 2\mathrm{cos^2}{(\theta)} - 1 = \dfrac{y^2-32}{32}$.
Cross-multiplying yields $32y = x(y^2-32)$.
Since $x,y>0$, $y^2-32$ must be positive, so $y > 5.5$.
Additionally, since $\triangle IBD$ has hypotenuse $\overline{IB}$ of length $8$, $BD=y < 8$.
Therefore, given that $BC=2y$ is an integer, the only possible values for $y$ are $6$, $6.5$, $7$, and $7.5$.
However, only one of these values, $y=6$, yields an integral value for $AB=x$, so we conclude that $y=6$ and $x=\dfrac{32(6)}{(6)^2-32}=48$.
Thus the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ must be $2(x+y) = \boxed{108}$.
Let $x = \cos 1^\circ + i \sin 1^\circ$
Then from the identity\[\sin 1 = \frac{x - \frac{1}{x}}{2i} = \frac{x^2 - 1}{2 i x},\]we deduce that (taking absolute values and noticing $|x| = 1$)\[|2\sin 1| = |x^2 - 1|.\]But because $\csc$ is the reciprocal of $\sin$ and because $\sin z = \sin (180^\circ - z)$, if we let our product be $M$ then\[\frac{1}{M} = \sin 1^\circ \sin 3^\circ \sin 5^\circ \dots \sin 177^\circ \sin 179^\circ\]\[= \frac{1}{2^{90}} |x^2 - 1| |x^6 - 1| |x^{10} - 1| \dots |x^{354} - 1| |x^{358} - 1|\]because $\sin$ is positive in the first and second quadrants
Now, notice that $x^2, x^6, x^{10}, \dots, x^{358}$ are the roots of $z^{90} + 1 = 0.$ Hence, we can write $(z - x^2)(z - x^6)\dots (z - x^{358}) = z^{90} + 1$, and so\[\frac{1}{M} = \dfrac{1}{2^{90}}|1 - x^2| |1 - x^6| \dots |1 - x^{358}| = \dfrac{1}{2^{90}} |1^{90} + 1| = \dfrac{1}{2^{89}}.\]It is easy to see that $M = 2^{89}$ and that our answer is $2 + 89 = \boxed{91}$.
Label the points where the plane intersects the top face of the cylinder as $C$ and $D$, and the center of the cylinder as $O$, such that $C,O,$ and $A$ are collinear
Let $T$ be the center of the bottom face, and $M$ the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$
Then $OT=4$, $TM=3$ (because of the 120 degree angle), and so $OM=5$.
Project $C$ and $D$ onto the bottom face to get $X$ and $Y$, respectively
Then the section $ABCD$ (whose area we need to find), is a stretching of the section $ABXY$ on the bottom face
The ratio of stretching is $\frac{OM}{TM}=\frac{5}{3}$, and we do not square this value when finding the area because it is only stretching in one direction
Using 30-60-90 triangles and circular sectors, we find that the area of the section $ABXY$ is $18\sqrt{3}\ + 12 \pi$
Thus, the area of section $ABCD$ is $20\pi + 30\sqrt{3}$, and so our answer is $20+30+3=\boxed{53}$.
If $\omega = 25$, the area of rectangle $PQRS$ is $0$, so
\[\alpha\omega - \beta\omega^2 = 25\alpha - 625\beta = 0\]
and $\alpha = 25\beta$
If $\omega = \frac{25}{2}$, we can reflect $APQ$ over $PQ$, $PBS$ over $PS$, and $QCR$ over $QR$ to completely cover rectangle $PQRS$, so the area of $PQRS$ is half the area of the triangle
Using Heron's formula, since $s = \frac{12 + 17 + 25}{2} = 27$,
\[[ABC] = \sqrt{27 \cdot 15 \cdot 10 \cdot 2} = 90\]
\[45 = \alpha\omega - \beta\omega^2 = \frac{625}{2} \beta - \beta\frac{625}{4} = \beta\frac{625}{4}\]
\[\beta = \frac{180}{625} = \frac{36}{125}\]
so the answer is $m + n = 36 + 125 = \boxed{161}$.
Our aim is to find the volume of the part of the cube submerged in the cylinder
In the problem, since three edges emanate from each vertex, the boundary of the cylinder touches the cube at three points
Because the space diagonal of the cube is vertical, by the symmetry of the cube, the three points form an equilateral triangle
Because the radius of the circle is $4$, by the Law of Cosines, the side length s of the equilateral triangle is
\[s^2 = 2\cdot(4^2) - 2l\cdot(4^2)\cos(120^{\circ}) = 3(4^2)\]
so $s = 4\sqrt{3}$.* Again by the symmetry of the cube, the volume we want to find is the volume of a tetrahedron with right angles on all faces at the submerged vertex, so since the lengths of the legs of the tetrahedron are $\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}} = 2\sqrt{6}$ (the three triangular faces touching the submerged vertex are all $45-45-90$ triangles) so
\[v = \frac{1}{3}(2\sqrt{6})\left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot (2\sqrt{6})^2\right) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 48\sqrt{6} = 8\sqrt{6}\]
\[v^2 = 64 \cdot 6 = \boxed{384}.\]
In this case, our base was one of the isosceles triangles (not the larger equilateral one)
To calculate volume using the latter, note that the height would be $2\sqrt{2}$.
Note that in a 30-30-120 triangle, side length ratios are $1:1:\sqrt{3}$.
Or, note that the altitude and the centroid of an equilateral triangle are the same point, so since the centroid is 4 units from the vertex (which is $\frac{2}{3}$ the length of the median), the altitude is 6, which gives a hypotenuse of $\frac{12}{\sqrt{3}}=4\sqrt{3}$ by $1:\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}:\frac{1}{2}$ relationship for 30-60-90 triangles.
First note that $1001 = 143 \cdot 7$ and $429 = 143 \cdot 3$ so every point of the form $(7k, 3k)$ is on the line
Then consider the line $l$ from $(7k, 3k)$ to $(7(k + 1), 3(k + 1))$
Translate the line $l$ so that $(7k, 3k)$ is now the origin
There is one square and one circle that intersect the line around $(0,0)$
Then the points on $l$ with an integral $x$-coordinate are, since $l$ has the equation $y = \frac{3x}{7}$:
\[(0,0), \left(1, \frac{3}{7}\right), \left(2, \frac{6}{7}\right), \left(3, 1 + \frac{2}{7}\right), \left(4, 1 + \frac{5}{7}\right), \left(5, 2 + \frac{1}{7}\right), \left(6, 2 + \frac{4}{7}\right), (7,3).\]
We claim that the lower right vertex of the square centered at $(2,1)$ lies on $l$
Since the square has side length $\frac{1}{5}$, the lower right vertex of this square has coordinates $\left(2 + \frac{1}{10},  1 - \frac{1}{10}\right) = \left(\frac{21}{10}, \frac{9}{10}\right)$
Because $\frac{9}{10} = \frac{3}{7} \cdot \frac{21}{10}$, $\left(\frac{21}{10}, \frac{9}{10}\right)$ lies on $l$
Since the circle centered at $(2,1)$ is contained inside the square, this circle does not intersect $l$
Similarly the upper left vertex of the square centered at $(5,2)$ is on $l$
Since every other point listed above is farther away from a lattice point (excluding (0,0) and (7,3)) and there are two squares with centers strictly between $(0,0)$ and $(7,3)$ that intersect $l$
Since there are $\frac{1001}{7} = \frac{429}{3} = 143$ segments from $(7k, 3k)$ to $(7(k + 1), 3(k + 1))$, the above count is yields $143 \cdot 2 = 286$ squares
Since every lattice point on $l$ is of the form $(3k, 7k)$ where $0 \le k \le 143$, there are $144$ lattice points on $l$
Centered at each lattice point, there is one square and one circle, hence this counts $288$ squares and circles
Thus $m + n = 286 + 288 = \boxed{574}$.
The inradius of $\triangle ABC$ is $100\sqrt 3$ and the circumradius is $200 \sqrt 3$
Now, consider the line perpendicular to plane $ABC$ through the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$
Note that $P,Q,O$ must lie on that line to be equidistant from each of the triangle's vertices
Also, note that since $P, Q, O$ are collinear, and $OP=OQ$, we must have $O$ is the midpoint of $PQ$
Now, Let $K$ be the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$, and $L$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$
We must have $\tan(\angle KLP+ \angle QLK)= \tan(120^{\circ})$
Setting $KP=x$ and $KQ=y$, assuming WLOG $x>y$, we must have $\tan(120^{\circ})=-\sqrt{3}=\dfrac{\dfrac{x+y}{100 \sqrt{3}}}{\dfrac{30000-xy}{30000}}$
Therefore, we must have $100(x+y)=xy-30000$
Also, we must have $\left(\dfrac{x+y}{2}\right)^{2}=\left(\dfrac{x-y}{2}\right)^{2}+120000$ by the Pythagorean theorem, so we have $xy=120000$, so substituting into the other equation we have $90000=100(x+y)$, or $x+y=900$
Since we want $\dfrac{x+y}{2}$, the desired answer is $\boxed{450}$.
Let $M$ and $N$ be midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$
The given conditions imply that $\triangle ABD\cong\triangle BAC$ and $\triangle CDA\cong\triangle DCB$, and therefore $MC=MD$ and $NA=NB$
It follows that $M$ and $N$ both lie on the common perpendicular bisector of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$, and thus line $MN$ is that common perpendicular bisector
Points $B$ and $C$ are symmetric to $A$ and $D$ with respect to line $MN$
If $X$ is a point in space and $X'$ is the point symmetric to $X$ with respect to line $MN$, then $BX=AX'$ and $CX=DX'$, so $f(X) = AX+AX'+DX+DX'$.
Let $Q$ be the intersection of $\overline{XX'}$ and $\overline{MN}$
Then $AX+AX'\geq 2AQ$, from which it follows that $f(X) \geq 2(AQ+DQ) = f(Q)$
It remains to minimize $f(Q)$ as $Q$ moves along $\overline{MN}$.
Allow $D$ to rotate about $\overline{MN}$ to point $D'$ in the plane $AMN$ on the side of $\overline{MN}$ opposite $A$
Because $\angle DNM$ is a right angle, $D'N=DN$
It then follows that $f(Q) = 2(AQ+D'Q)\geq 2AD'$, and equality occurs when $Q$ is the intersection of $\overline{AD'}$ and $\overline{MN}$
Thus $\min f(Q) = 2AD'$
Because $\overline{MD}$ is the median of $\triangle ADB$, the Length of Median Formula shows that $4MD^2 = 2AD^2 + 2BD^2 - AB^2 = 2\cdot 28^2 + 2 \cdot 44^2 - 52^2$ and $MD^2 = 684$
By the Pythagorean Theorem $MN^2 = MD^2 - ND^2 = 8$.
Because $\angle AMN$ and $\angle D'NM$ are right angles,\[(AD')^2 = (AM+D'N)^2 + MN^2 = (2AM)^2 + MN^2 = 52^2 + 8 = 4\cdot 678.\]It follows that $\min f(Q) = 2AD' = 4\sqrt{678}$
The requested sum is $4+678=\boxed{682}$.
First note that\[\angle I_1AI_2 = \angle I_1AX + \angle XAI_2 = \frac{\angle BAX}2 + \frac{\angle CAX}2 = \frac{\angle A}2\]is a constant not depending on $X$, so by $[AI_1I_2] = \tfrac12(AI_1)(AI_2)\sin\angle I_1AI_2$ it suffices to minimize $(AI_1)(AI_2)$
Let $a = BC$, $b = AC$, $c = AB$, and $\alpha = \angle AXB$
Remark that\[\angle AI_1B = 180^\circ - (\angle I_1AB + \angle I_1BA) = 180^\circ - \tfrac12(180^\circ - \alpha) = 90^\circ + \tfrac\alpha 2.\]Applying the Law of Sines to $\triangle ABI_1$ gives\[\frac{AI_1}{AB} = \frac{\sin\angle ABI_1}{\sin\angle AI_1B}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad AI_1 = \frac{c\sin\frac B2}{\cos\frac\alpha 2}.\]Analogously one can derive $AI_2 = \tfrac{b\sin\frac C2}{\sin\frac\alpha 2}$, and so\[[AI_1I_2] = \frac{bc\sin\frac A2 \sin\frac B2\sin\frac C2}{2\cos\frac\alpha 2\sin\frac\alpha 2} = \frac{bc\sin\frac A2 \sin\frac B2\sin\frac C2}{\sin\alpha}\geq bc\sin\frac A2 \sin\frac B2\sin\frac C2,\]with equality when $\alpha = 90^\circ$, that is, when $X$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $\overline{BC}$
In this case the desired area is $bc\sin\tfrac A2\sin\tfrac B2\sin\tfrac C2$
To make this feasible to compute, note that\[\sin\frac A2=\sqrt{\frac{1-\cos A}2}=\sqrt{\frac{1-\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}}2} = \sqrt{\dfrac{(a-b+c)(a+b-c)}{4bc}}.\]Applying similar logic to $\sin \tfrac B2$ and $\sin\tfrac C2$ and simplifying yields a final answer of\begin{align*}bc\sin\frac A2\sin\frac B2\sin\frac C2&=bc\cdot\dfrac{(a-b+c)(b-c+a)(c-a+b)}{8abc}\\&=\dfrac{(30-32+34)(32-34+30)(34-30+32)}{8\cdot 32}=\boxed{126}.\end{align*}
Let the tangent circle be $\omega$
Some notation first: let $BC=a$, $AB=b$, $s$ be the semiperimeter, $\theta=\angle ABC$, and $r$ be the inradius
Intuition tells us that the radius of $\omega$ is $r+\frac{2rs}{s-a}$ (using the exradius formula)
However, the sum of the radius of $\omega$ and $\frac{rs}{s-b}$ is equivalent to the distance between the incenter and the the $B/C$ excenter
Denote the B excenter as $I_B$ and the incenter as $I$
Lemma: $I_BI=\frac{2b*IB}{a}$ We draw the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$
Let the angle bisector of $\angle ABC$ hit the circumcircle at a second point $M$
By the incenter-excenter lemma, $AM=CM=IM$
Let this distance be $\alpha$
Ptolemy's theorem on $ABCM$ gives us\[a\alpha+b\alpha=b(\alpha+IB)\to \alpha=\frac{b*IB}{a}\]Again, by the incenter-excenter lemma, $II_B=2IM$ so $II_b=\frac{2b*IB}{a}$ as desired
Using this gives us the following equation:\[\frac{2b*IB}{a}=r+\frac{2rs}{s-a}+\frac{rs}{s-b}\]Motivated by the $s-a$ and $s-b$, we make the following substitution: $x=s-a, y=s-b$ This changes things quite a bit
Here's what we can get from it:\[a=2y, b=x+y, s=x+2y\]It is known (easily proved with Heron's and a=rs) that\[r=\sqrt{\frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-b)}{s}}=\sqrt{\frac{xy^2}{x+2y}}\]Using this, we can also find $IB$: let the midpoint of $BC$ be $N$
Using Pythagorean's Theorem on $\triangle INB$,\[IB^2=r^2+(\frac{a}{2})^2=\frac{xy^2}{x+2y}+y^2=\frac{2xy^2+2y^3}{x+2y}=\frac{2y^2(x+y)}{x+2y}\]We now look at the RHS of the main equation:\[r+\frac{2rs}{s-a}+\frac{rs}{s-b}=r(1+\frac{2(x+2y)}{x}+\frac{x+2y}{y})=r(\frac{x^2+5xy+4y^2}{xy})=\frac{r(x+4y)(x+y)}{xy}=\frac{2(x+y)IB}{2y}\]Cancelling some terms, we have\[\frac{r(x+4y)}{x}=IB\]Squaring,\[\frac{2y^2(x+y)}{x+2y}=\frac{(x+4y)^2*xy^2}{x^2(x+2y)}\to \frac{(x+4y)^2}{x}=2(x+y)\]Expanding and moving terms around gives\[(x-8y)(x+2y)=0\to x=8y\]Reverse substituting,\[s-a=8s-8b\to b=\frac{9}{2}a\]Clearly the smallest solution is $a=2$ and $b=9$, so our answer is $2+9+9=\boxed{20}$.

Notice that\[\angle DFE=\angle CFE-\angle CFD=\angle CBE-\angle CAD=180-B-A=C.\]By the Law of Cosines,\[\cos C=\frac{AC^2+BC^2-AB^2}{2\cdot AC\cdot BC}=\frac34.\]Then,\[DE^2=DF^2+EF^2-2\cdot DF\cdot EF\cos C=32\implies DE=4\sqrt2.\]Let $X=\overline{AB}\cap\overline{CF}$, $a=XB$, and $b=XD$
Then,\[XA\cdot XD=XC\cdot XF=XB\cdot XE\implies b(a+4)=a(b+4\sqrt2)\implies b=a\sqrt2.\]However, since $\triangle XFD\sim\triangle XAC$, $XF=\tfrac{4+a}3$, but since $\triangle XFE\sim\triangle XBC$,\[\frac75=\frac{4+a}{3a}\implies a=\frac54\implies BE=a+a\sqrt2+4\sqrt2=\frac{5+21\sqrt2}4,\]and the requested sum is $5+21+2+4=\boxed{32}$.
Let $\angle MKN=\alpha$ and $\angle LNK=\beta$
Note $\angle KLP=\beta$.
Then, $KP=28\sin\beta=8\cos\alpha$
Furthermore, $KN=\frac{65}{\sin\alpha}=\frac{28}{\sin\beta} \Rightarrow 65\sin\beta=28\sin\alpha$.
Dividing the equations gives\[\frac{65}{28}=\frac{28\sin\alpha}{8\cos\alpha}=\frac{7}{2}\tan\alpha\Rightarrow \tan\alpha=\frac{65}{98}\]
Thus, $MK=\frac{MN}{\tan\alpha}=98$, so $MO=MK-KO=\boxed{90}$.
[asy] unitsize(10); pair A = (0,0); pair B = (9,0); pair C = (15,8); pair D = (-6,8); pair E = (-6,0); draw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(B--D--A); label("$A$",A,dir(-120)); label("$B$",B,dir(-60)); label("$C$",C,dir(60)); label("$D$",D,dir(120)); label("$E$",E,dir(-135)); label("$9$",(A+B)/2,dir(-90)); label("$10$",(D+A)/2,dir(-150)); label("$10$",(C+B)/2,dir(-30)); label("$17$",(D+B)/2,dir(60)); label("$17$",(A+C)/2,dir(120));  draw(D--E--A,dotted); label("$8$",(D+E)/2,dir(180)); label("$6$",(A+E)/2,dir(-90)); [/asy]
Extend $AB$ to form a right triangle with legs $6$ and $8$ such that $AD$ is the hypotenuse and connect the points $CD$ so that you have a rectangle
(We know that $\triangle ADE$ is a $6-8-10$, since $\triangle DEB$ is an $8-15-17$.) The base $CD$ of the rectangle will be $9+6+6=21$
Now, let $E$ be the intersection of $BD$ and $AC$
This means that $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle DCE$ are with ratio $\frac{21}{9}=\frac73$
Set up a proportion, knowing that the two heights add up to 8
We will let $y$ be the height from $E$ to $DC$, and $x$ be the height of $\triangle ABE$.\[\frac{7}{3}=\frac{y}{x}\]\[\frac{7}{3}=\frac{8-x}{x}\]\[7x=24-3x\]\[10x=24\]\[x=\frac{12}{5}\]
This means that the area is $A=\tfrac{1}{2}(9)(\tfrac{12}{5})=\tfrac{54}{5}$
This gets us $54+5=\boxed{59}.$
[asy] unitsize(20); pair B = (0,0); pair A = (2,sqrt(45)); pair C = (8,0); draw(circumcircle(A,B,(-17/8,0)),rgb(.7,.7,.7)); draw(circumcircle(A,C,(49/8,0)),rgb(.7,.7,.7)); draw(B--A--C--cycle); label("$A$",A,dir(105)); label("$B$",B,dir(-135)); label("$C$",C,dir(-75)); dot((2.68,2.25)); label("$K$",(2.68,2.25),dir(-150)); label("$\omega_1$",(-6,1)); label("$\omega_2$",(14,6)); label("$7$",(A+B)/2,dir(140)); label("$8$",(B+C)/2,dir(-90)); label("$9$",(A+C)/2,dir(60)); [/asy]
Note that from the tangency condition that the supplement of $\angle CAB$ with respects to lines $AB$ and $AC$ are equal to $\angle AKB$ and $\angle AKC$, respectively, so from tangent-chord,\[\angle AKC=\angle AKB=180^{\circ}-\angle BAC\]Also note that $\angle ABK=\angle KAC$, so $\triangle AKB\sim \triangle CKA$
Using similarity ratios, we can easily find\[AK^2=BK*KC\]However, since $AB=7$ and $CA=9$, we can use similarity ratios to get\[BK=\frac{7}{9}AK, CK=\frac{9}{7}AK\]Now we use Law of Cosines on $\triangle AKB$: From reverse Law of Cosines, $\cos{\angle BAC}=\frac{11}{21}\implies \cos{(180^{\circ}-\angle BAC)}=-\frac{11}{21}$
This gives us\[AK^2+\frac{49}{81}AK^2+\frac{22}{27}AK^2=49\]\[\implies \frac{196}{81}AK^2=49\]\[AK=\frac{9}{2}\]so our answer is $9+2=\boxed{11}$.
The actual size of the diagram doesn't matter
To make calculation easier, we discard the original area of the circle, $1$, and assume the side length of the octagon is $2$
Let $r$ denote the radius of the circle, $O$ be the center of the circle
Then $r^2= 1^2 + (\sqrt{2}+1)^2= 4+2\sqrt{2}$
Now, we need to find the "D"shape, the small area enclosed by one side of the octagon and 1/8 of the circumference of the circle:\[D= \frac{1}{8} \pi r^2 - [A_1 A_2 O]=\frac{1}{8} \pi (4+2\sqrt{2})- (\sqrt{2}+1)\]
Let $PU$ be the height of $\triangle A_1 A_2 P$, $PV$ be the height of $\triangle A_3 A_4 P$, $PW$ be the height of $\triangle A_6 A_7 P$
From the $1/7$ and $1/9$ condition we have\[\triangle P A_1 A_2= \frac{\pi r^2}{7} - D= \frac{1}{7} \pi (4+2\sqrt{2})-(\frac{1}{8} \pi (4+2\sqrt{2})- (\sqrt{2}+1))\]
\[\triangle P A_3 A_4= \frac{\pi r^2}{9} - D= \frac{1}{9} \pi (4+2\sqrt{2})-(\frac{1}{8} \pi (4+2\sqrt{2})- (\sqrt{2}+1))\]which gives $PU= (\frac{1}{7}-\frac{1}{8}) \pi (4+ 2\sqrt{2}) + \sqrt{2}+1$ and $PV= (\frac{1}{9}-\frac{1}{8}) \pi (4+ 2\sqrt{2}) + \sqrt{2}+1$
Now, let $A_1 A_2$ intersects $A_3 A_4$ at $X$, $A_1 A_2$ intersects $A_6 A_7$ at $Y$,$A_6 A_7$ intersects $A_3 A_4$ at $Z$
Clearly, $\triangle XYZ$ is an isosceles right triangle, with right angle at $X$ and the height with regard to which shall be $3+2\sqrt2$
Now $\frac{PU}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{PV}{\sqrt{2}} + PW = 3+2\sqrt2$ which gives $PW= 3+2\sqrt2-\frac{PU}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{PV}{\sqrt{2}}$
$=3+2\sqrt{2}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\frac{1}{7}-\frac{1}{8}) \pi (4+ 2\sqrt{2}) + \sqrt{2}+1+(\frac{1}{9}-\frac{1}{8}) \pi (4+ 2\sqrt{2}) + \sqrt{2}+1))$
$=1+\sqrt{2}- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{9}-\frac{1}{4})\pi(4+2\sqrt{2})$
Now, we have the area for $D$ and the area for $\triangle P A_6 A_7$, so we add them together:
$\text{Target Area} = \frac{1}{8} \pi (4+2\sqrt{2})- (\sqrt{2}+1) + (1+\sqrt{2})- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{9}-\frac{1}{4})\pi(4+2\sqrt{2})$
$=(\frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{9}-\frac{1}{4}))\text{Total Area}$
The answer should therefore be $\frac{1}{8}- \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(\frac{16}{63}-\frac{16}{64})=\frac{1}{8}- \frac{\sqrt{2}}{504}$
The answer is $\boxed{504}$.
Let $AP=a, AQ=b, \cos\angle A = k$
Therefore $AB= \frac{b}{k} , AC= \frac{a}{k}$
By power of point, we have $AP\cdot BP=XP\cdot YP , AQ\cdot CQ=YQ\cdot XQ$ Which are simplified to
$400= \frac{ab}{k} - a^2$
$525= \frac{ab}{k} - b^2$
$a^2= \frac{ab}{k} - 400$
$b^2= \frac{ab}{k} - 525$
$k= \frac{ab}{a^2+400} = \frac{ab}{b^2+525}$
Let $u=a^2+400=b^2+525$ Then, $a=\sqrt{u-400},b=\sqrt{u-525},k=\frac{\sqrt{(u-400)(u-525)}}{u}$
In triangle $APQ$, by law of cosine
$25^2= a^2 + b^2 - 2abk$
Pluging (1)
$625=  \frac{ab}{k} - 400 + \frac{ab}{k} - 525 -2abk$
$\frac{ab}{k} - abk =775$
Substitute everything by $u$
$u- \frac{(u-400)(u-525)}{u} =775$
The quadratic term is cancelled out after simplified
Which gives $u=1400$
Plug back in, $a= \sqrt{1000} , b=\sqrt{875}$
$AB\cdot AC= \frac{a}{k} \frac{b}{k} = \frac{ab}{\frac{ab}{u} \cdot\frac{ab}{u} } = \frac{u^2}{ab} = \frac{1400 \cdot 1400}{ \sqrt{ 1000\cdot 875 }} = 560 \sqrt{14}$
So the final answer is $560 + 14 = \boxed{574}$
Let the points of intersection of $\ell_a, \ell_b,\ell_c$ with $\triangle ABC$ divide the sides into consecutive segments $BD,DE,EC,CF,FG,GA,AH,HI,IB$
Furthermore, let the desired triangle be $\triangle XYZ$, with $X$ closest to side $BC$, $Y$ closest to side $AC$, and $Z$ closest to side $AB$
Hence, the desired perimeter is $XE+EF+FY+YG+GH+HZ+ZI+ID+DX=(DX+XE)+(FY+YG)+(HZ+ZI)+115$ since $HG=55$, $EF=15$, and $ID=45$.
Note that $\triangle AHG\sim \triangle BID\sim \triangle EFC\sim \triangle ABC$, so using similar triangle ratios, we find that $BI=HA=30$, $BD=HG=55$, $FC=\frac{45}{2}$, and $EC=\frac{55}{2}$.
We also notice that $\triangle EFC\sim \triangle YFG\sim \triangle EXD$ and $\triangle BID\sim \triangle HIZ$
Using similar triangles, we get that\[FY+YG=\frac{GF}{FC}\cdot \left(EF+EC\right)=\frac{225}{45}\cdot \left(15+\frac{55}{2}\right)=\frac{425}{2}\]\[DX+XE=\frac{DE}{EC}\cdot \left(EF+FC\right)=\frac{275}{55}\cdot \left(15+\frac{45}{2}\right)=\frac{375}{2}\]\[HZ+ZI=\frac{IH}{BI}\cdot \left(ID+BD\right)=2\cdot \left(45+55\right)=200\]Hence, the desired perimeter is $200+\frac{425+375}{2}+115=600+115=\boxed{715}$.
Assume the incircle touches $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, $DE$, $EA$ at $P,Q,R,S,T$ respectively
Then let $PB=x=BQ=RD=SD$, $ET=y=ES=CR=CQ$, $AP=AT=z$
So we have $x+y=6$, $x+z=5$ and $y+z$=7, solve it we have $x=2$, $z=3$, $y=4$
Let the center of the incircle be $I$, by SAS we can proof triangle $BIQ$ is congruent to triangle $DIS$, and triangle $CIR$ is congruent to triangle $SIE$
Then we have $\angle AED=\angle BCD$, $\angle ABC=\angle CDE$
Extend $CD$, cross ray $AB$ at $M$, ray $AE$ at $N$, then by AAS we have triangle $END$ is congruent to triangle $BMC$
Thus $\angle M=\angle N$
Let $EN=MC=a$, then $BM=DN=a+2$
So by law of cosine in triangle $END$ and triangle $ANM$ we can obtain\[\frac{2a+8}{2(a+7)}=\cos N=\frac{a^2+(a+2)^2-36}{2a(a+2)}\], solved it gives us $a=8$, which yield triangle $ANM$ to be a triangle with side length 15, 15, 24, draw a height from $A$ to $NM$ divides it into two triangles with side lengths 9, 12, 15, so the area of triangle $ANM$ is 108
Triangle $END$ is a triangle with side lengths 6, 8, 10, so the area of two of them is 48, so the area of pentagon is $108-48=\boxed{60}$.
If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units
Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units
Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\text{ units} = \boxed{21\text{ units}}.$
Assume $O$ to be the center of triangle $ABC$, $OT$ cross $BC$ at $M$, link $XM$, $YM$
Let $P$ be the middle point of $BT$ and $Q$ be the middle point of $CT$, so we have $MT=3\sqrt{15}$
Since $\angle A=\angle CBT=\angle BCT$, we have $\cos A=\frac{11}{16}$
Notice that $\angle XTY=180^{\circ}-A$, so $\cos XYT=-\cos A$, and this gives us $1143-2XY^2=\frac{-11}{8}XT\cdot YT$
Since $TM$ is perpendicular to $BC$, $BXTM$ and $CYTM$ cocycle (respectively), so $\theta_1=\angle ABC=\angle MTX$ and $\theta_2=\angle ACB=\angle YTM$
So $\angle XPM=2\theta_1$, so\[\frac{\frac{XM}{2}}{XP}=\sin \theta_1\], which yields $XM=2XP\sin \theta_1=BT(=CT)\sin \theta_1=TY.$ So same we have $YM=XT$
Apply Ptolemy theorem in $BXTM$ we have $16TY=11TX+3\sqrt{15}BX$, and use Pythagoras theorem we have $BX^2+XT^2=16^2$
Same in $YTMC$ and triangle $CYT$ we have $16TX=11TY+3\sqrt{15}CY$ and $CY^2+YT^2=16^2$
Solve this for $XT$ and $TY$ and submit into the equation about $\cos XYT$, we can obtain the result $XY^2=\boxed{717}$.
The areas bounded by the unit square and alternately bounded by the lines through $\left(\frac{5}{8},\frac{3}{8}\right)$ that are vertical or have a slope of $1/2$ show where $P$ can be placed to satisfy the condition
One of the areas is a trapezoid with bases $1/16$ and $3/8$ and height $5/8$
The other area is a trapezoid with bases $7/16$ and $5/8$ and height $3/8$
Then,\[\frac{\frac{1}{16}+\frac{3}{8}}{2}\cdot\frac{5}{8}+\frac{\frac{7}{16}+\frac{5}{8}}{2}\cdot\frac{3}{8}=\frac{86}{256}=\frac{43}{128}\implies43+128=\boxed{171}\]
After sketching, it is clear a $90^{\circ}$ rotation is done about $(x,y)$
Looking between $A$ and $A'$, $x+y=18$ and $x-y=24$
Solving gives $(x,y)\implies(21,-3)$
Thus $90+21-3=\boxed{108}$.
Consider the cross section of the cones and sphere by a plane that contains the two axes of symmetry of the cones as shown below
The sphere with maximum radius will be tangent to the sides of each of the cones
The center of that sphere must be on the axis of symmetry of each of the cones and thus must be at the intersection of their axes of symmetry
Let $A$ be the point in the cross section where the bases of the cones meet, and let $C$ be the center of the sphere
Let the axis of symmetry of one of the cones extend from its vertex, $B$, to the center of its base, $D$
Let the sphere be tangent to $\overline{AB}$ at $E$
The right triangles $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle CBE$ are similar, implying that the radius of the sphere is\[CE = AD \cdot\frac{BC}{AB} = AD \cdot\frac{BD-CD}{AB} =3\cdot\frac5{\sqrt{8^2+3^2}} = \frac{15}{\sqrt{73}}=\sqrt{\frac{225}{73}}.\]The requested sum is $225+73=\boxed{298}$.[asy] unitsize(0.6cm); pair A = (0,0);  pair TriangleOneLeft = (-6,0);  pair TriangleOneDown = (-3,-8);  pair TriangleOneMid = (-3,0);  pair D = (0,-3);  pair TriangleTwoDown = (0,-6);  pair B = (-8,-3);  pair C = IP(TriangleOneMid -- TriangleOneDown, B--D); pair EE = foot(C, A, B);  real radius = arclength(C--EE);  path circ = Circle(C, radius);    draw(A--B--TriangleTwoDown--cycle); draw(B--D);  draw(A--TriangleOneLeft--TriangleOneDown--cycle);  draw(circ);  draw(C--EE);  draw(TriangleOneMid -- TriangleOneDown, gray);  dot("$B$", B, W);  dot("$E$", EE, NW);  dot("$A$", A, NE);  dot("$D$", D, E);  dot("$C$", C, SE); [/asy]
Since the total area is $4$, the side length of square $ABCD$ is $2$
We see that since triangle $HAE$ is a right isosceles triangle with area 1, we can determine sides $HA$ and $AE$ both to be $\sqrt{2}$
Now, consider extending $FB$ and $IE$ until they intersect
Let the point of intersection be $K$
We note that $EBK$ is also a right isosceles triangle with side $2-\sqrt{2}$ and find it's area to be $3-2\sqrt{2}$
Now, we notice that $FIK$ is also a right isosceles triangle and find it's area to be $\frac{1}{2}$$FI^2$
This is also equal to $1+3-2\sqrt{2}$ or $4-2\sqrt{2}$
Since we are looking for $FI^2$, we want two times this
That gives $\boxed{8-4\sqrt{2}}$.
Draw the Median connecting C to the center O of the circle
Note that the centroid is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the distance from O to C
Thus, as C traces a circle of radius 12, the Centroid will trace a circle of radius $\frac{12}{3}=4$.
The area of this circle is $\pi\cdot4^2=16\pi \approx \boxed{50}$.
Let $O_i$ be the center of circle $\omega_i$ for $i=1,2,3$, and let $K$ be the intersection of lines $O_1P_1$ and $O_2P_2$
Because $\angle P_1P_2P_3 = 60^\circ$, it follows that $\triangle P_2KP_1$ is a $30-60-90^\circ$ triangle
Let $d=P_1K$; then $P_2K = 2d$ and $P_1P_2 = \sqrt 3d$
The Law of Cosines in $\triangle O_1KO_2$ gives\[8^2 = (d+4)^2 + (2d-4)^2 - 2(d+4)(2d-4)\cos 60^\circ,\]which simplifies to $3d^2 - 12d - 16 = 0$
The positive solution is $d = 2 + \tfrac23\sqrt{21}$
Then $P_1P_2 = \sqrt 3 d = 2\sqrt 3 + 2\sqrt 7$, and the required area is\[\frac{\sqrt 3}4\cdot\left(2\sqrt 3 + 2\sqrt 7\right)^2 = 10\sqrt 3 + 6\sqrt 7 = \sqrt{300} + \sqrt{252}.\]The requested sum is $300 + 252 = \boxed{552}$.
Let the triangle have coordinates $(0,0),(12,0),(0,5).$ Then the coordinates of the incenter and circumcenter are $(2,2)$ and $(6,2.5),$ respectively
If we let $M=(x,x),$ then $x$ satisfies\[\sqrt{(2.5-x)^2+(6-x)^2}+x=6.5\]\[2.5^2-5x+x^2+6^2-12x+x^2=6.5^2-13x+x^2\]\[x^2=(5+12-13)x\]\[x\neq 0\implies x=4.\]Now the area of our triangle can be calculated with the Shoelace Theorem
The answer turns out to be $\boxed{\frac{7}{2}}$
We let the side length of the base of the box be $x$, so the height of the box is $x+3$
The surface area of each box then is $2x^2 + 4(x)(x+3)$
Therefore, we must have $$2x^2+4x(x+3) \ge 90.$$Expanding the product on the left and rearranging gives $ 2x^2+4x^2+12x-90 \ge 0$, so $6x^2+12x-90 \ge 0$
Dividing by 6 gives  $x^2+2x-15 \ge 0$, so  $(x+5)(x-3) \ge 0$
Therefore, we have $x \le -5 \text{ or } x\ge 3$
Since the dimensions of the box can't be negative, the least possible length of the side of the base is $3$
This makes the height of the box $3+3=\boxed{6}$.
Note that we also could have solved this problem with trial-and-error
The surface area increases as the side length of the base of the box increases
If we let this side length be 1, then the surface area is $2\cdot 1^2 + 4(1)(4) = 18$
If we let it be 2, then the surface area is $2\cdot 2^2 + 4(2)(5) = 8 + 40 = 48$
If we let it be 3, then the surface area is $2\cdot 3^2 + 4(3)(6) = 18+72 = 90$
So, the smallest the base side length can be is 3, which means the smallest the height can be is $\boxed{6}$.
The centroid of a triangle is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the way from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposing side
Thus, the length of any diagonal of this quadrilateral is $20$
The diagonals are also parallel to sides of the square, so they are perpendicular to each other, and so the area of the quadrilateral is $\frac{20\cdot20}{2} = \boxed{200}$.
Let $CD=1$, $BC=x$, and $AB=x^2$
Note that $AB/BC=x$
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $BD=\sqrt{x^2+1}$
Since $\triangle BCD \sim \triangle ABC \sim \triangle CEB$, the ratios of side lengths must be equal
Since $BC=x$, $CE=\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}$ and $BE=\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}$
Let F be a point on $\overline{BC}$ such that $\overline{EF}$ is an altitude of triangle $CEB$
Note that $\triangle CEB \sim \triangle CFE \sim \triangle EFB$
Therefore, $BF=\frac{x}{x^2+1}$ and $CF=\frac{x^3}{x^2+1}$
Since $\overline{CF}$ and $\overline{BF}$ form altitudes of triangles $CED$ and $BEA$, respectively, the areas of these triangles can be calculated
Additionally, the area of triangle $BEC$ can be calculated, as it is a right triangle
Solving for each of these yields:\[[BEC]=[CED]=[BEA]=(x^3)/(2(x^2+1))\]\[[ABCD]=[AED]+[DEC]+[CEB]+[BEA]\]\[(AB+CD)(BC)/2= 17*[CEB]+ [CEB] + [CEB] + [CEB]\]\[(x^3+x)/2=(20x^3)/(2(x^2+1))\]\[(x)(x^2+1)=20x^3/(x^2+1)\]\[(x^2+1)^2=20x^2\]\[x^4-18x^2+1=0 \implies x^2=9+4\sqrt{5}=4+2(2\sqrt{5})+5\]Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{2+\sqrt{5}}$

Let $O$ be the center of the circle
Note that $EC + CA = EA = \sqrt{AD^2 + DE^2} = \sqrt{(2+2+3)^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{74}$
However, by Power of a Point, $(EC)(EC + CA) = EO^2 - R^2 = (2+3)^2 + 5^2 - 2^2 = 25 + 25 - 4 = 46 \implies EC = \frac{46}{\sqrt{74}}$, so $AC = \sqrt{74} - \frac{46}{\sqrt{74}} = \frac{28}{\sqrt{74}}$
Now $BC = \sqrt{AB^2 - AC^2} = \sqrt{4^2 - \frac{28^2}{74}} = \sqrt{\frac{16 \cdot 74 - 28^2}{74}} = \sqrt{\frac{1184 - 784}{74}} = \frac{20}{\sqrt{74}}$
Since $\angle ACB = 90^{\circ}, [ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot AC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{20}{\sqrt{74}} \cdot \frac{28}{\sqrt{74}} = \boxed{\frac{140}{37}}$.
Divide the boundary of the square into halves, thereby forming $8$ segments
Without loss of generality, let the first point $A$ be in the bottom-left segment
Then, it is easy to see that any point in the $5$ segments not bordering the bottom-left segment will be distance at least $\dfrac{1}{2}$ apart from $A$
Now, consider choosing the second point on the bottom-right segment
The probability for it to be distance at least $0.5$ apart from $A$ is $\dfrac{0 + 1}{2} = \dfrac{1}{2}$ because of linearity of the given probability
(Alternatively, one can set up a coordinate system and use geometric probability.)
If the second point $B$ is on the left-bottom segment, then if $A$ is distance $x$ away from the left-bottom vertex, then $B$ must be up to $\dfrac{1}{2} - \sqrt{0.25 - x^2}$ away from the left-middle point
Thus, using an averaging argument we find that the probability in this case is\[\frac{1}{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2} \int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \dfrac{1}{2} - \sqrt{0.25 - x^2} dx = 4\left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{\pi}{16} \right) = 1 - \frac{\pi}{4}.\]
(Alternatively, one can equate the problem to finding all valid $(x, y)$ with $0 < x, y < \dfrac{1}{2}$ such that $x^2 + y^2 \ge \dfrac{1}{4}$, i.e
$(x, y)$ is outside the unit circle with radius $0.5.$)
Thus, averaging the probabilities gives\[P = \frac{1}{8} \left( 5 + \frac{1}{2} + 1 - \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = \frac{1}{32} \left( 26 - \pi \right).\]
Our answer is $\boxed{59}$.
Let $BC = x$ and $CD = AD = y$ be positive integers
Drop a perpendicular from $A$ to $CD$ to show that, using the Pythagorean Theorem, that\[x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = y^2.\]Simplifying yields $x^2 - 4y + 4 = 0$, so $x^2 = 4(y - 1)$
Thus, $y$ is one more than a perfect square.
The perimeter $p = 2 + x + 2y = 2y + 2\sqrt{y - 1} + 2$ must be less than 2015
Simple calculations demonstrate that $y = 31^2 + 1 = 962$ is valid, but $y = 32^2 + 1 = 1025$ is not
On the lower side, $y = 1$ does not work (because $x > 0$), but $y = 1^2 + 1$ does work
Hence, there are 31 valid $y$ (all $y$ such that $y = n^2 + 1$ for $1 \le n \le 31$), and so our answer is $\boxed{31}$
Let $a$ denote the length of a diagonal opposite adjacent sides of length $14$ and $3$, $b$ for sides $14$ and $10$, and $c$ for sides $3$ and $10$
Using Ptolemy's Theorem on the five possible quadrilaterals in the configuration, we obtain:
\begin{align} c^2 &= 3a+100 \\ c^2 &= 10b+9 \\ ab &= 30+14c \\ ac &= 3c+140\\ bc &= 10c+42 \end{align}
Using equations $(1)$ and $(2)$, we obtain:
\[a = \frac{c^2-100}{3}\]
\[b = \frac{c^2-9}{10}\]
Plugging into equation $(4)$, we find that:
\begin{align*} \frac{c^2-100}{3}c &= 3c + 140\\ \frac{c^3-100c}{3} &= 3c + 140\\ c^3-100c &= 9c + 420\\ c^3-109c-420 &=0\\ (c-12)(c+7)(c+5)&=0 \end{align*}
Or similarly into equation $(5)$ to check:
\begin{align*} \frac{c^2-9}{10}c &= 10c+42\\ \frac{c^3-9c}{10} &= 10c + 42\\ c^3-9c &= 100c + 420\\ c^3-109c-420 &=0\\ (c-12)(c+7)(c+5)&=0 \end{align*}
$c$, being a length, must be positive, implying that $c=12$
In fact, this is reasonable, since $10+3\approx 12$ in the pentagon with apparently obtuse angles
Plugging this back into equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ we find that $a = \frac{44}{3}$ and $b= \frac{135}{10}=\frac{27}{2}$.
We desire $3c+a+b = 3\cdot 12 + \frac{44}{3} + \frac{27}{2} = \frac{216+88+81}{6}=\frac{385}{6}$, so it follows that the answer is $385 + 6 = \boxed{391}$
Note as above that ABCD must be tangential to obtain the circle with maximal radius
Let $E$, $F$, $G$, and $H$ be the points on $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, and $DA$ respectively where the circle is tangent
Let $\theta=\angle BAD$ and $\alpha=\angle ADC$
Since the quadrilateral is cyclic(because we want to maximize the circle, so we set the quadrilateral to be cyclic), $\angle ABC=180^{\circ}-\alpha$ and $\angle BCD=180^{\circ}-\theta$
Let the circle have center $O$ and radius $r$
Note that $OHD$, $OGC$, $OFB$, and $OEA$ are right angles.
Hence $FOG=\theta$, $GOH=180^{\circ}-\alpha$, $EOH=180^{\circ}-\theta$, and $FOE=\alpha$.
Therefore, $AEOH\sim OFCG$ and $EBFO\sim HOGD$.
Let $x=CG$
Then $CF=x$, $BF=BE=9-x$, $GD=DH=7-x$, and $AH=AE=x+5$
Using $AEOH\sim OFCG$ and $EBFO\sim HOGD$ we have $r/(x+5)=x/r$, and $(9-x)/r=r/(7-x)$
By equating the value of $r^2$ from each, $x(x+5)=(7-x)(9-x)$
Solving we obtain $x=3$ so that $\boxed{2\sqrt{6}}$.
There must be four rays emanating from $X$ that intersect the four corners of the square region
Depending on the location of $X$, the number of rays distributed among these four triangular sectors will vary
We start by finding the corner-most point that is $100$-ray partitional (let this point be the bottom-left-most point).
We first draw the four rays that intersect the vertices
At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas
Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal
The remaining $96$ rays are divided among the other two triangular sectors, each sector with $48$ rays, thus dividing these two sectors into $49$ triangles of equal areas.
Let the distance from this corner point to the closest side be $a$ and the side of the square be $s$
From this, we get the equation $\frac{a\times s}{2}=\frac{(s-a)\times s}{2}\times\frac1{49}$
Solve for $a$ to get $a=\frac s{50}$
Therefore, point $X$ is $\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to
By moving $X$ $\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$-ray partitional point
We can continue moving $X$ right and up to derive the set of points that are $100$-ray partitional.
In the end, we get a square grid of points each $\frac s{50}$ apart from one another
Since this grid ranges from a distance of $\frac s{50}$ from one side to $\frac{49s}{50}$ from the same side, we have a $49\times49$ grid, a total of $2401$ $100$-ray partitional points
To find the overlap from the $60$-ray partitional, we must find the distance from the corner-most $60$-ray partitional point to the sides closest to it
Since the $100$-ray partitional points form a $49\times49$ grid, each point $\frac s{50}$ apart from each other, we can deduce that the $60$-ray partitional points form a $29\times29$ grid, each point $\frac s{30}$ apart from each other
To find the overlap points, we must find the common divisors of $30$ and $50$ which are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10$
Therefore, the overlapping points will form grids with points $s$, $\frac s{2}$, $\frac s{5}$, and $\frac s{10}$ away from each other respectively
Since the grid with points $\frac s{10}$ away from each other includes the other points, we can disregard the other grids
The total overlapping set of points is a $9\times9$ grid, which has $81$ points
Subtract $81$ from $2401$ to get $2401-81=\boxed{2320}$.
Let $O$ be the incenter of $\triangle{ABC}$
Because $\overline{MO} \parallel \overline{BC}$ and $\overline{BO}$ is the angle bisector of $\angle{ABC}$, we have
\[\angle{MBO} = \angle{CBO} = \angle{MOB} = \frac{1}{2}\angle{MBC}\]
It then follows due to alternate interior angles and base angles of isosceles triangles that $MO = MB$
Similarly, $NO = NC$
The perimeter of $\triangle{AMN}$ then becomes\begin{align*} AM + MN + NA &= AM + MO + NO + NA \\ &= AM + MB + NC + NA \\ &= AB + AC \\ &= \boxed{30} \end{align*}
A triangle with sides of 9,8 and 3 will satisfy these conditions
This will have longest side of 9
If the longest side has length 10, then the sum of the remaining two sides $x+y$ must be greater than 10 by the triangle inequality
However, this cannot be since this will equal 10, and thus, the maximum length of one side is $\boxed{9}$.
Let $a_n=|A_{n-1}A_n|$
We need to rewrite the recursion into something manageable
The two strange conditions, $B$'s lie on the graph of $y=\sqrt{x}$ and $A_{n-1}B_nA_n$ is an equilateral triangle, can be compacted as follows:\[\left(a_n\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2=\frac{a_n}{2}+a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}+\cdots+a_1\]which uses $y^2=x$, where $x$ is the height of the equilateral triangle and therefore $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ times its base.
The relation above holds for $n=k$ and for $n=k-1$ $(k>1)$, so\[\left(a_k\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2-\left(a_{k-1}\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2=\]\[=\left(\frac{a_k}{2}+a_{k-1}+a_{k-2}+\cdots+a_1\right)-\left(\frac{a_{k-1}}{2}+a_{k-2}+a_{k-3}+\cdots+a_1\right)\]Or,\[a_k-a_{k-1}=\frac23\]This implies that each segment of a successive triangle is $\frac23$ more than the last triangle
To find $a_{1}$, we merely have to plug in $k=1$ into the aforementioned recursion and we have $a_{1} - a_{0} = \frac23$
Knowing that $a_{0}$ is $0$, we can deduce that $a_{1} = 2/3$.Thus, $a_n=\frac{2n}{3}$, so $A_0A_n=a_n+a_{n-1}+\cdots+a_1=\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{3}$
We want to find $n$ so that $n^2<300<(n+1)^2$
$n=\boxed{17}$ is our answer.

Let $x = CA$
Then $\tan\theta = \tan(\angle BAF - \angle DAE)$, and since $\tan\angle BAF = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{x-2}$ and $\tan\angle DAE = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{x-1}$, we have
\[\tan\theta = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{x-2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{x-1}}{1 + \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{x-2}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{3}}{x-1}}= \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{x^2-3x+8}\]
With calculus, taking the derivative and setting equal to zero will give the maximum value of $\tan \theta$
Otherwise, we can apply AM-GM:
\begin{align*} \frac{x^2 - 3x + 8}{x} = \left(x + \frac{8}{x}\right) -3 &\geq 2\sqrt{x \cdot \frac 8x} - 3 = 4\sqrt{2} - 3\\ \frac{x}{x^2 - 3x + 8} &\leq \frac{1}{4\sqrt{2}-3}\\ \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{x^2 - 3x + 8} = \tan \theta &\leq \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4\sqrt{2}-3}\end{align*}
Thus, the maximum is at $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4\sqrt{2}-3}}$.
Let the radius of the large sphere be $R$, and of the inner sphere $r$
Label the vertices of the tetrahedron $ABCD$, and let $O$ be the center
Then pyramid $[OABC] + [OABD] + [OACD] + [OBCD] = [ABCD]$, where $[\ldots]$ denotes volume; thus $[OABC] = \frac{[ABCD]}{4}$
Since $OABC$ and $ABCD$ are both pyramids that share a common face $ABC$, the ratio of their volumes is the ratio of their altitudes to face $ABC$, so $r = \frac {h_{ABCD}}4$
However, $h_{ABCD} = r + R$, so it follows that $r = \frac {R}{3}$
Then the radius of an external sphere is $\frac{R-r}2 = \frac {R}{3} = r$.
Since the five described spheres are non-intersecting, it follows that the ratio of the volumes of the spheres is $5 \cdot \left( \frac 13 \right)^3 = \frac{5}{27} \approx \boxed{.2}$.
Let $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ be the side lengths of the rectangular prism
By Pythagoras, the lengths of the external diagonals are $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2},$ $\sqrt{b^2 + c^2},$ and $\sqrt{a^2 + c^2}.$ If we square each of these to obtain $a^2 + b^2,$ $b^2 + c^2,$ and $a^2 + c^2,$ we observe that since each of $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are positive, then the sum of any two of the squared diagonal lengths must be larger than the square of the third diagonal length
For example, $(a^2 + b^2) + (b^2 + c^2) = (a^2 + c^2) + 2b^2 > a^2 + c^2$ because $2b^2 > 0.$
Thus, we test each answer choice to see if the sum of the squares of the two smaller numbers is larger than the square of the largest number
Looking at choice (B), we see that $4^2 + 5^2 = 41 < 7^2 = 49,$ so the answer is $\boxed{\{4,5,7\}}.$

Start by considering the triangle traced by $P$ as the circle moves around the triangle
It turns out this triangle is similar to the $6-8-10$ triangle (Proof: Realize that the slope of the line made while the circle is on $AC$ is the same as line $AC$ and that it makes a right angle when the circle switches from being on $AB$ to $BC$)
Then, drop the perpendiculars as shown.
Since the smaller triangle is also a $6-8-10 = 3-4-5$ triangle, we can label the sides $EF,$ $CE,$ and $DF$ as $3x, 4x,$ and $5x$ respectively
Now, it is clear that $GB = DE + 1 = 4x + 1$, so $AH = AG = 8 - GB = 7 - 4x$ since $AH$ and $AG$ are both tangent to the circle P at some point
We can apply the same logic to the other side as well to get $CI = 5 - 3x$
Finally, since we have $HI = DF = 5x$, we have $AC = 10 = (7 - 4x) + (5x) + (5 - 3x) = 12 - 2x$, so $x = 1$ and $3x + 4x + 5x = \boxed{12}$
We have all the angles we need, but most obviously, we see that right angle in triangle $ABD$.
Note also that angle $BAD$ is 6 degrees, so length $AB = cos(6)$ because the diameter, $AD$, is 1.
Now, we can concentrate on triangle $ABX$ (after all, now we can decipher all angles easily and use Law of Sines).
We get:
$\frac{AB}{\sin(\angle{AXB})} =\frac{AX}{\sin(\angle{ABX})}$
That's equal to
$\frac{\cos(6)}{\sin(180-18)} =\frac{AX}{\sin(12)}$
Therefore, our answer is equal to: $\boxed{\cos(6^\circ)\sin(12^\circ)\csc(18^\circ)}$
Note that the center of the circle is the midpoint of $AB$, call it $M$
When we decrease $x$, the limiting condition is that the circle will eventually be tangent to segment $AD$ at $D$ and segment $BC$ at $C$
That is, $MD\perp AD$ and $MC\perp BC$.
From here, we drop the altitude from $D$ to $AM$; call the base $N$
Since $\triangle DNM \sim \triangle ADM$, we have\[\frac{DM}{19/2}=\frac{46}{DM}.\]Thus, $DM=\sqrt{19\cdot 23}$
Furthermore, $x^2=AM^2-DM^2=46^2-19\cdot 23=\boxed{1679}.$

Applying Power of a Point on $P$, we find that $PC=9$ and thus $PD=16$
Observing that $PD=2BP$ and that $\angle BPD=60^{\circ}$, we conclude that $BPD$ is a $30-60-90$ right triangle with right angle at $B$
Thus, $BD=8\sqrt{3}$ and triangle $ABD$ is also right
Using that fact that the circumcircle of a right triangle has its diameter equal to the hypotenuse, we compute using the Pythagorean Theorem $AD=2r=2\sqrt{73}$
From here we see that $r^2=\boxed{73}$.
We begin by drawing a diagram.[asy] import olympiad; import cse5; import geometry; size(150); defaultpen(fontsize(10pt)); defaultpen(0.8); dotfactor = 4; pair A = origin; pair C = A+dir(55); pair D = A+dir(0); pair B = extension(A,A+dir(90),C,C+dir(-155)); label("$A$",A,S); label("$C$",C,NE); label("$D$",D,SE); label("$B$",B,NW); label("$4$",B--C,NW); label("$3$",A--B,W); draw(A--C--D--cycle); draw(A--B--C); draw(rightanglemark(B,C,D,2)); draw(rightanglemark(B,A,D,2)); [/asy]We extend $CB$ and $DA$ to meet at $E.$ This gives us a couple right triangles in $CED$ and $BEA.$[asy] import olympiad; import cse5; import geometry; size(250); defaultpen(fontsize(10pt)); defaultpen(0.8); dotfactor = 4; pair A = origin; pair C = A+dir(55); pair D = A+dir(0); pair B = extension(A,A+dir(90),C,C+dir(-155)); pair E = extension(A,A+2*dir(180),B,B+2*dir(-155)); label("$A$",A,S); label("$C$",C,NE); label("$D$",D,SE); label("$B$",B,NW); label("$4$",B--C,NW); label("$3$",A--B,W); label("$E$",E,SW); draw(A--C--D--cycle); draw(A--B--C); draw(rightanglemark(B,C,D,2)); draw(rightanglemark(B,A,D,2)); draw(A--E--B,dashed); [/asy]We see that $\angle E = 30^\circ$
Hence, $\triangle BEA$ and $\triangle DEC$ are 30-60-90 triangles.
Using the side ratios of 30-60-90 triangles, we have $BE=2BA=6$
This tells us that $CE=BC+BE=4+6=10$
Also, $EA=3\sqrt{3}$.
Because $\triangle DEC\sim\triangle BEA$, we have\[\frac{10}{3\sqrt{3}}=\frac{CD}{3}.\]Solving the equation, we have\begin{align*} \frac{CD}3&=\frac{10}{3\sqrt{3}}\\ CD&=3\cdot\frac{10}{3\sqrt{3}}\\ CD&=\boxed{\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}} \end{align*}
First, we find out the coordinates of the vertices of quadrilateral $BEIH$, then use the Shoelace Theorem to solve for the area
Denote $B$ as $(0,0)$
Then $E (0,1)$
Since I is the intersection between lines $DE$ and $AF$, and since the equations of those lines are $y = \dfrac{1}{2}x + 1$ and $y = -2x + 2$, $I (\dfrac{2}{5}, \dfrac{6}{5})$
Using the same method, the equation of line $BD$ is $y = x$, so $H (\dfrac{2}{3}, \dfrac{2}{3})$
Using the Shoelace Theorem, the area of $BEIH$ is $\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot\dfrac{14}{15} = \boxed{\frac{7}{15}}$.
Using the tangent-tangent theorem, $PA=AB=PA'=A'B'=4$
We can then drop perpendiculars from the centers of the circles to the points of tangency and use similar triangles
Let us let the center of the smaller circle be point $S$ and the center of the larger circle be point $L$
If we let the radius of the larger circle be $x$ and the radius of the smaller circle be $y$, we can see that, using similar triangle, $x=2y$
In addition, the total hypotenuse of the larger right triangles equals $2(x+y)$ since half of it is $x+y$, so $y^2+4^2=(3y)^2$
If we simplify, we get $y^2+16=9y^2$, so $8y^2=16$, so $y=\sqrt2$
This means that the smaller circle has area $\boxed{2\pi}$.
Let $F$ be the point such that $DF$ and $CF$ are parallel to $CE$ and $DE$, respectively, and let $DE = x$ and $BE^2 = 169-x^2$
Then, $[FDEC] = x(4+\sqrt{169-x^2}) = [ABC] + [BED] + [ABD] + [AFD] = 6 + \dfrac{x\sqrt{169-x^2}}{2} + 30 + \dfrac{(x-3)(4+\sqrt{169-x^2})}{2}$
So, $4x+x\sqrt{169-x^2} = 60 + x\sqrt{169-x^2} - 3\sqrt{169-x^2}$
Simplifying $3\sqrt{169-x^2} = 60 - 4x$, and $1521 - 9x^2 = 16x^2 - 480x + 3600$
Therefore $25x^2 - 480x + 2079 = 0$, and $x = \dfrac{48\pm15}{5}$
Checking, $x = \dfrac{63}{5}$ is the answer, so $\dfrac{DE}{DB} = \dfrac{\dfrac{63}{5}}{13} = \dfrac{63}{65}$
The answer is $\boxed{128}$.
Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be the vertices of this quadrilateral such that $AB=70$, $BC=110$, $CD=130$, and $DA=90$
Let $O$ be the center of the incircle
Draw in the radii from the center of the incircle to the points of tangency
Let these points of tangency $X$, $Y$, $Z$, and $W$ be on $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, and $DA$, respectively
Using the right angles and the fact that the $ABCD$ is cyclic, we see that quadrilaterals $AXOW$ and $OYCZ$ are similar.
Let $CZ$ have length $n$
Chasing lengths, we find that $AX=AW=n-40$
Using Brahmagupta's Formula we find that $ABCD$ has area $K=300\sqrt{1001}$ and from that we find, using that fact that $rs=K$, where $r$ is the inradius and $s$ is the semiperimeter, $r=\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{1001}$.
From the similarity we have\[\frac{CY}{OX}=\frac{OY}{AX}\]Or, after cross multiplying and writing in terms of the variables,\[n^2-40n-r^2=0\]Plugging in the value of $r$ and solving the quadratic gives $n=CZ=71.5$, and from there we compute the desired difference to get $\boxed{13}$.
Label the angles as shown in the diagram
Since $\angle DEC$ forms a linear pair with $\angle DEA$, $\angle DEA$ is a right angle.
[asy] pair A = (0,0), B = (7,4.2), C = (10, 0), D = (3, -5), E = (3, 0), F = (7,0); draw(A--B--C--D--cycle,dot); draw(A--E--F--C,dot); draw(D--E--F--B,dot);  markscalefactor = 0.075;  draw(rightanglemark(B, A, D)); draw(rightanglemark(D, E, A)); draw(rightanglemark(B, F, A)); draw(rightanglemark(D, C, B)); draw(rightanglemark(D, E, C)); draw(rightanglemark(B, F, C)); MP("A",(0,0),W); MP("B",(7,4.2),N); MP("C",(10,0),E); MP("D",(3,-5),S); MP("E",(3,0),N); MP("F",(7,0),S); [/asy]
Let $\angle DAE = \alpha$ and $\angle ADE = \beta$.
Since $\alpha + \beta = 90^\circ$, and $\alpha + \angle BAF = 90^\circ$, then $\beta = \angle BAF$
By the same logic, $\angle ABF = \alpha$.
As a result, $\triangle AED \sim \triangle BFA$
By the same logic, $\triangle CFB \sim \triangle DEC$.
Then, $\frac{BF}{AF} = \frac{3}{5}$, and $\frac{CF}{BF} = \frac{5}{7}$.
Then, $7CF = 5BF$, and $5BF = 3AF$.
By the transitive property, $7CF = 3AF$
$AC = AF + CF = 10$, and plugging in, we get $CF = 3$.
Finally, plugging in to $\frac{CF}{BF} = \frac{5}{7}$, we get $BF = \boxed{4.2}$
Call the length of a side of the cube x
Thus, the volume of the cube is $x^3$
We can then find that a side of this regular octahedron is the square root of $(\frac{x}{2})^2$+$(\frac{x}{2})^2$ which is equivalent to $\frac{x\sqrt{2}}{2}$
Using our general formula for the volume of a regular octahedron of side length a, which is $\frac{a^3\sqrt2}{3}$, we get that the volume of this octahedron is...
$(\frac{x\sqrt{2}}{2})^3 \rightarrow \frac{x^3\sqrt{2}}{4} \rightarrow \frac{x^3\sqrt{2}}{4}*\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \rightarrow \frac{2x^3}{12}=\frac{x^3}{6}$
Comparing the ratio of the volume of the octahedron to the cube is…
$\frac{\frac{x^3}{6}}{x^3} \rightarrow \boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$
The radius of the base of the cone is $10/2 = 5$, so the volume of the cone is \[\frac{1}{3} \pi \cdot 5^2 \cdot 6 = \boxed{50 \pi}.\]
First of all, we see that $PB = PA + AB = 3 + AB.$ By Power of a Point, we know that $(PA)(PB) = (PT)^2,$ so we have $3(PB) = (AB - 3)^2.$

Let us define $x$ such that $x = PB = 3 + AB,$ then $AB = x - 3.$ Substituting, we now have $3x = (x - 6)^2.$
Then, we see that $3x = x^2 - 12x + 36,$ so $x^2 - 15x + 36 = 0.$ Factoring, we have $(x - 3)(x - 12) = 0$ so $x = 3$ or $x = 12,$ but we are given that $PA < PB,$ so $x > 3.$ That means our only answer for $x,$ hence $PB,$ is $\boxed{12}.$
The diagram can be quartered as shown:[asy] draw((0,0)--(0,5)--(5,5)--(5,0)--(0,0)); draw((0,1)--(4,5)); draw((1,0)--(5,4)); draw((0,4)--(4,0)); draw((1,5)--(5,1)); draw((0,0)--(5,5),dotted); draw((0,5)--(5,0),dotted); [/asy]and reassembled into two smaller squares of side $k$, each of which looks like this:[asy] draw((0,0)--(0,5)--(5,5)--(5,0)--(0,0)); draw((0,1)--(4,1)--(4,5)); draw((1,0)--(1,4)--(5,4)); label("blue",(0.5,0.5)); label("blue",(4.5,4.5)); label("red",(0.5,4.5)); label("red",(4.5,0.5)); label("white",(2.5,2.5)); [/asy]The border in this figure is the former cross, which still occupies 36% of the area
Therefore the inner square occupies 64% of the area, from which we deduce that it is $0.8k \times 0.8k$, and that one blue square must be $0.1k\times 0.1k=0.01k^2$ or 1% each
Thus the blue area is $\boxed{2}\%$ of the total.
The three arcs make up the entire circle, so the circumference of the circle is $3+4+5=12$ and the radius is $\frac{12}{2\pi}=\frac{6}{\pi}$
Also, the lengths of the arcs are proportional to their corresponding central angles
Thus, we can write the values of the arcs as $3\theta$, $4\theta$, and $5\theta$ for some $\theta$
By Circle Angle Sum, we obtain $3\theta+4\theta+5\theta=360$
Solving yields $\theta=30$
Thus, the angles of the triangle are $90$, $120$, and $150$
Using $[ABC]=\frac{1}{2}ab\sin{C}$, we obtain $\frac{r^2}{2}(\sin{90}+\sin{120}+\sin{150})$
Substituting $\frac{6}{\pi}$ for $r$ and evaluating yields $\boxed{\frac{9}{\pi^2}(\sqrt{3}+3)}$.
Let $E$ and $F$ be the intersections of lines $AB$ and $BC$ with the circle
One can prove that $BCDE$ is a rectangle, so $BE=CD$.
In order for the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ to be an integer, the expression $\frac{(AB+CD)BC}2=(AB+CD)BF$ must be an integer, so $BF$ must be rational.
By Power of a Point, $AB\cdot BE=BF^2\implies AB\cdot CD=BF$, so $AB\cdot CD$ must be a perfect square
Among the choices, the only one where $AB\cdot CD$ is a perfect square is $\boxed{AB=9, CD=4}$.
Let the trapezium have diagonal legs of length $x$ and a shorter base of length $y$
Drop altitudes from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base to form two right-angled triangles, which are congruent since the trapezium is isosceles
Thus using the base angle of $\arcsin(0.8)$ gives the vertical side of these triangles as $0.8x$ and the horizontal side as $0.6x$
Now notice that the sides of the trapezium can be seen as being made up of tangents to the circle, and thus using the fact that "the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length" gives $2y + 0.6x + 0.6x = 2x$
Also, using the given length of the longer base tells us that $y + 0.6x + 0.6x = 16$
Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x=10$ and $y=4$, so the height of the trapezium is $0.8 \times 10 = 8$
Thus the area is $\frac{1}{2}(4+16)(8) = \boxed{80}$.
By the triangle inequality in $\triangle ABC$, we find that $BC$ and $CA$ must sum to greater than $41$, so they must be (in some order) $7$ and $36$, $13$ and $36$, $18$ and $27$, $18$ and $36$, or $27$ and $36$
We try $7$ and $36$, and now by the triangle inequality in $\triangle ABD$, we must use the remaining numbers $13$, $18$, and $27$ to get a sum greater than $41$, so the only possibility is $18$ and $27$
This works as we can put $BC = 36$, $AC = 7$, $AD = 18$, $BD = 27$, $CD = 13$, so that $\triangle ADC$ and $\triangle BDC$ also satisfy the triangle inequality
Hence we have found a solution that works, and it can be verified that the other possibilities don't work, though as this is a multiple-choice competition, you probably wouldn't do that in order to save time
In any case, the answer is $CD = \boxed{13}$.
Let $C$ have coordinates $(p, q)$
Then by the Shoelace Formula, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{3}{2} \lvert {12q-5p} \rvert$
Since $p$ and $q$ are integers, $\lvert {12q-5p} \rvert$ is a positive integer, and by Bezout's Lemma, it can equal $1$ (e.g
with $q = 2, p = 5$), so the minimum area is $\frac{3}{2} \times 1 = \boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$.
Consider a cross-section of this problem in which a circle lies with its center somewhere above a line
A line segment of $8$ cm can be drawn from the line to the bottom of the ball
Denote the distance between the center of the circle and the line as $x$
We can construct a right triangle by dragging the center of the circle to the intersection of the circle and the line
We then have the equation $x^2+(12)^2=(x+8)^2$, $x^2+144=x^2+16x+64$
Solving, the answer is $\boxed{13}$.
We are given that the area of the inscribed square is $441$, so the side length of that square is $21$
Since the square divides the $45-45-90$ larger triangle into 2 smaller congruent $45-45-90$, then the legs of the larger isosceles right triangle ($BC$ and $AB$) are equal to $42$.[asy] draw((0,0)--(10,0)--(0,10)--cycle); draw((6.5,3.25)--(3.25,0)--(0,3.25)--(3.25,6.5)); label("A", (0,10), W); label("B", (0,0), W); label("C", (10,0), E); label("S", (25/3,11/6), E); label("S", (11/6,25/3), E); label("S", (5,5), NE); [/asy]
We now have that $3S=42\sqrt{2}$, so $S=14\sqrt{2}$
But we want the area of the square which is $S^2=(14\sqrt{2})^2= \boxed{392}$
Assume we have a scalene triangle $ABC$
Arbitrarily, let $12$ be the height to base $AB$ and $4$ be the height to base $AC$
Due to area equivalences, the base $AC$ must be three times the length of $AB$.
Let the base $AB$ be $x$, thus making $AC = 3x$
Thus, setting the final height to base $BC$ to $h$, we note that (by area equivalence) $\frac{BC \cdot h}{2} = \frac{3x \cdot 4}{2} = 6x$
Thus, $h = \frac{12x}{BC}$
We note that to maximize $h$ we must minimize $BC$
Using the triangle inequality, $BC + AB > AC$, thus $BC + x > 3x$ or $BC > 2x$
The minimum value of $BC$ is $2x$, which would output $h = 6$
However, because $BC$ must be larger than $2x$, the minimum integer height must be $\boxed{5}$.
$ABE$ and $DCE$ are similar isosceles triangles
It remains to find the square of the ratio of their sides
Draw in $AD$
Because $AB$ is a diameter, $\angle ADB=\angle ADE=90^{\circ}$
Thus,\[\frac{DE}{AE}=\cos\alpha\]So\[\frac{DE^2}{AE^2}=\boxed{\cos^2\alpha}\]
In any right triangle with legs parallel to the axes, one median to the midpoint of a leg has slope $4$ times that of the other
This can easily be shown with coordinates: any triangle of this sort may be labelled with right angle at $P(a,b)$, other vertices $Q(a,b+2c)$ and $R(a-2d,b)$, and thus midpoints $(a,b+c)$ and $(a-d,b)$, so that the slopes are $\frac{c}{2d}$ and $\frac{2c}{d} = 4(\frac{c}{2d})$, thus showing that one is $4$ times the other as required.
Thus in our problem, $m$ is either $3 \times 4 = 12$ or $3 \div 4 = \frac{3}{4}$
In fact, both are possible, and each for infinitely many triangles
We shall show this for $m=12$, and the argument is analogous for $m=\frac{3}{4}$
Take any right triangle with legs parallel to the axes and a hypotenuse with slope $12 \div 2 = 6$, e.g
the triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,6)$
Then quick calculations show that the medians to the legs have slopes $12$ and $3$
Now translate the triangle (without rotating it) so that its medians intersect at the point where the lines $y=12x+2$ and $y=3x+1$ intersect
This forces the medians to lie on these lines (since their slopes are determined, and now we force them to go through a particular point; a slope and a point uniquely determine a line)
Finally, for any central dilation of this triangle (a larger or smaller triangle with the same centroid and sides parallel to this one's sides), the medians will still lie on these lines, showing the "infinitely many" part of the result.
Hence, to sum up, $m$ can in fact be both $12$ or $\frac{3}{4}$, which is exactly $\boxed{2}$ values.
Well, the shaded sector's area is basically $\text{(ratio of } \theta \text{ to total angle of circle)} \times \text{(total area)} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \cdot (\pi r^2) = \frac{\theta}{2} \cdot (AC)^2$.
In addition, if you let $\angle{ACB} = \theta$, then\[\tan \theta = \frac{AB}{AC}\]\[AB = AC\tan \theta = r\tan \theta\]\[[ABC] = \frac{AB \cdot AC}{2} = \frac{r^2\tan \theta}{2}\]Then the area of that shaded thing on the left becomes\[\frac{r^2\tan \theta}{2} - \frac{\theta \cdot r^2}{2}\]We want this to be equal to the sector area so\[\frac{r^2\tan \theta}{2} - \frac{\theta \cdot r^2}{2} = \frac{\theta \cdot r^2}{2}\]\[\frac{r^2\tan \theta}{2} = \theta \cdot r^2\]\[\boxed{\tan \theta = 2\theta}\]
We imagine this problem on a coordinate plane and let Alice's starting position be the origin
We see that she will travel along two edges and then go halfway along a third
Therefore, her new $x$-coordinate will be $1 + 2 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{2}$ because she travels along a distance of $2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1$ km because of the side relationships of an equilateral triangle, then $2$ km because the line is parallel to the $x$-axis, and the remaining distance is $\frac{1}{2}$ km because she went halfway along and because of the logic for the first part of her route
For her $y$-coordinate, we can use similar logic to find that the coordinate is $\sqrt{3} + 0 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} =  \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
Therefore, her distance is\[\sqrt{\left(\frac{7}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{49}{4} + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{52}{4}} = \boxed{\sqrt{13}}\]
We note that we can draw the minor axis to see that because the minor axis is the minimum distance between two opposite points on the ellipse, we can draw a line through two opposite points of the cylinder, and so the minor axis is $2(1) = 2$
Therefore, our answer is $2(1.5) = \boxed{3}$.
Since we are given that $\triangle{PAB}\sim\triangle{PCA}$, we have $\frac{PC}{PA}=\frac{6}{8}=\frac{PA}{PC+7}$.
Solving for $PA$ in $\frac{PC}{PA}=\frac{6}{8}=\frac{3}{4}$ gives us $PA=\frac{4PC}{3}$.
We also have $\frac{PA}{PC+7}=\frac{3}{4}$
Substituting $PA$ in for our expression yields $\frac{\frac{4PC}{3}}{PC+7}=\frac{3}{4}$
Which we can further simplify to $\frac{16PC}{3}=3PC+21$
$\frac{7PC}{3}=21$
$PC=\boxed{9}$
Since $rs = A$, where $r$ is the inradius, $s$ is the semiperimeter, and $A$ is the area, we have that the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the triangle is $\frac{\pi r^2}{rs} = \frac{\pi r}{s}$
Now we try to express $s$ as $h$ and $r$
Denote the points where the incircle meets the triangle as $X,Y,Z$, where $O$ is the incenter, and denote $AX = AY = z, BX = BZ = y, CY = CZ = x$
Since $XOZB$ is a square (tangents are perpendicular to radius), $r = BX = BZ = y$
The perimeter can be expressed as $2(x+y+z)$, so the semiperimeter is $x+y+z$
The hypotenuse is $AY+CY = z+x$
Thus we have $s = x+y+z = (z+x)+y = h+r$
The answer is $\boxed{\frac{\pi r}{h+r}}$.
Let $O$ be the center of the circle and $A,B$ be two points on the circle such that $\angle AOB = \theta$
If the circle circumscribes the sector, then the circle must circumscribe $\triangle AOB$.

Draw the perpendicular bisectors of $OA$ and $OB$ and mark the intersection as point $C$, and draw a line from $C$ to $O$
By HL Congruency and CPCTC, $\angle AOC = \angle BOC = \theta /2$.
Let $R$ be the circumradius of the triangle
Using the definition of cosine for right triangles,\[\cos (\theta /2) = \frac{3}{R}\]\[R = \frac{3}{\cos (\theta /2)}\]\[R = 3 \sec (\theta /2)\]Answer choices A, C, and E are smaller, so they are eliminated
However, as $\theta$ aproaches $90^\circ$, the value $3\sec\theta$ would approach infinity while $3\sec \tfrac12 \theta$ would approach $\tfrac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}$
A super large circle would definitely not be a circumcircle if $\theta$ is close to $90^\circ$, so we can confirm that the answer is $\boxed{3 \sec \frac{1}{2} \theta}$.
With reference to the diagram above, let $E$ be the point on $AB$ such that $DE||BC$
Let $\angle ABC=\alpha$
We then have $\alpha =\angle AED = \angle EDC$ since $AB||CD$, so $\angle ADE=\angle ADC-\angle BDC=2\alpha-\alpha = \alpha$, which means $\triangle AED$ is isosceles.
Therefore, $AB=AE+EB=\boxed{a+b}$.
One of the most common formulas involving the inradius of a triangle is $A = rs$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle, $r$ is the inradius, and $s$ is the semiperimeter.
The problem states that $A = p = 2s$
This means $2s = rs$, or $r = \boxed{2}$
Since triangle $ACD$ is right, $\angle CAD = 90^\circ - \angle ACD = 90^\circ - 50^\circ = 40^\circ$.

Also, $\angle AOC = 2 \angle ABC = 2 \cdot 70^\circ = 140^\circ$
Since triangle $ACO$ is isosceles with $AO = CO$, $\angle CAO = (180^\circ - \angle AOC)/2 = (180^\circ - 140^\circ)/2 = 20^\circ$
Hence, $\angle DAE = \angle CAD - \angle CAO = 40^\circ - 20^\circ = \boxed{20^\circ}$.
To make the problem much simpler while staying in the constraints of the problem, position point $C$ halfway between $A$ and $B$
Then, call $\overline{AC} = \overline{BC}=r$
The area of the shaded region is then\[\frac{ \pi r^2 - \pi (r/2)^2 - \pi (r/2)^2}{2}=\frac{\pi r^2}{4}\]Because $\overline{CD}=r$ the area of the circle with $\overline{CD}$ as radius is $\pi r^2$
Our ratio is then\[\frac{\pi r^2}{4} : \pi r^2 = \boxed{1:4}\]
We know that the volume of a cylinder is equal to $\pi r^2h$, where $r$ and $h$ are the radius and height, respectively
So we know that $2\pi (r+6)^2-2\pi r^2=y=\pi r^2(2+6)-2\pi r^2$
Expanding and rearranging, we get that $2\pi (12r+36)=6\pi r^2$
Divide both sides by $6\pi$ to get that $4r+12=r^2$, and rearrange to see that $r^2-4r-12=0$
This factors to become $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=6$ or $r=-2$
Obviously, the radius cannot be negative, so our answer is $\boxed{6}$

Draw line $PB$, and let $[PEB] = 2b$, $[PDB] = a$, and $[CAP] = c$, so $[CPD] = 3a$ and $[APE] = 3b$
Because $\triangle CAE$ and $\triangle CEB$ share an altitude,\[c + 3b = \tfrac{3}{2} (3a+a+2b)\]\[c + 3b = 6a + 3b\]\[c  = 6a\]Because $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ABD$ share an altitude,\[6a+3a = 3(a+2b+3b)\]\[9a = 3a+15b\]\[6a = 15b\]\[a = \tfrac{5}{2}b\]Thus, $[CAP] = 15b$, and since $[APE] = 3b$, $r = \tfrac{CP}{PE} = \boxed{5}$.
Let $BE = x$ and $BC = y$
Since $AF \parallel BC$, by AA Similarity, $\triangle AFE \sim \triangle CBE$
That means $\frac{AF}{CB} = \frac{FE}{BE}$
Substituting in values results in\[\frac{AF}{y} = \frac{32}{x}\]Thus, $AF = \frac{32y}{x}$, so $FD = \frac{32y - xy}{x}$.
In addition, $DC \parallel AB$, so by AA Similarity, $\triangle FDG = \triangle FAB$
That means\[\frac{\frac{32y-xy}{x}}{\frac{32y}{x}} = \frac{24}{x+32}\]Cross multiply to get\[\frac{y(32-x)}{x} (x+32) = \frac{32y}{x} \cdot 24\]Since $x \ne 0$ and $y \ne 0$,\[(32-x)(32+x) = 32 \cdot 24\]\[32^2 - x^2 = 32 \cdot 24\]\[32 \cdot 8 = x^2\]Thus, $x = \boxed{16}$.

Because $\stackrel \frown {AB} = 120^\circ$ and $\stackrel \frown {BC} = 72^\circ$, $\stackrel \frown {AC} = 168^\circ$
Also, $OA = OC$ and $OE \perp AC$, so $\angle AOE = \angle COE = 84^\circ$
Since $\angle BOC = 72^\circ$, $\angle BOE = 156^\circ$
Finally, $\triangle BOE$ is an isosceles triangle, so $\angle OBE = 12^\circ$
Because $\angle BAC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 72 = 36^\circ$, the ratio of the magnitudes of $\angle OBE$ and $\angle BAC$ is $\frac{12}{36} = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Since $\triangle ABC$ is inscribed and $AB$ is the diameter, $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle, and by the Pythagorean Theorem, $AC^2 + BC^2 = AC^2 = (2r)^2$
Thus, $s^2 = 4r^2 + 2 \cdot AC \cdot BC$.
The area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{AC \cdot BC}{2}$, so $2 \cdot [ABC] = AC \cdot BC$
That means $s^2 = 4r^2 + 4 \cdot [ABC]$
The area of $\triangle ABC$ can also be calculated by using base $AB$ and the altitude from $C$
The maximum possible value of the altitude is $r$, so the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$ is $r^2$.
Therefore, $\boxed{s^2 \le 8r^2}$
Partition the unit square into four smaller squares of sidelength $\frac{1}{2}$
Each of the five points lies in one of these squares, and so by the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists two points in the same $\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{1}{2}$ square - the maximum possible distance between them being $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}$ by Pythagoras.

By the Pythagorean Theorem,\[4a^2 + b^2 = 9\]\[a^2 + 4b^2 = \frac{49}{4}\]Adding the two equations yields $5a^2 + 5b^2 = \frac{85}{4}$, so $a^2 + b^2 = \frac{17}{4}$
Thus, $MN = \frac{\sqrt{17}}{2}$, so $AB = \boxed{\sqrt{17}}$.

Draw $X$, where $X$ is on $BC$ and $AC \parallel PX$
By AA Similarity, $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle PBX$, so $PX = 3an$, $BX = 4an$, and $CX = 4an - 4n$.
Also, let $\angle ABC = a$ and $\angle BAC = b$
Since the angles of a triangle add up to $180^{\circ}$, $\angle BCA = 180-a-b$
By Exterior Angle Theorem, $\angle ACX = a+b$, and since $CP$ bisects $\angle ACX$, $\angle PCX = \frac{a+b}{2}$
Because $AC \parallel PX$, $\angle BXP = 180 - a - b$
Thus, $\angle CPX = \frac{a+b}{2}$, making $\triangle CPX$ an isosceles triangle.
Because $\triangle CPX$ is isosceles, $PX = CX$, so $4an - 4n = 3an$
That means $a = 4$, so $PB = 4 \cdot AB$
Thus, $PA = PB - AB = 3 \cdot AB$, so $PA : AB = \boxed{3:1}$.

That means $CN = h-x$
The sides of the rectangle are parallel, so $XY \parallel WZ$
That means by AA Similarity, $\triangle CXY \sim \triangle CAB$
Letting $n$ be the length of the base of the rectangle, that means\[\frac{h-x}{n} = \frac{h}{b}\]\[n = \frac{b(h-x)}{h}\]Thus, the area of the rectangle is $\boxed{\frac{bx}{h}(h-x)}$
Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(a_1,a_2)$
Then since $A$ is on the graph of $y=-\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we know that $a_2 = -\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$
We can also use our knowledge of special right triangles to write $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$
Let $C$ be the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ and let $O$ be the origin
Then $OCA$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so the ratio of the length of $OC$ to the length of $CA$ is $\sqrt{3}:1$
Now the coordinates of C are $(0, a_2)$, so the length of $OC$ is just $-a_2$ (since $a_2$ is negative) and the length of $CA$ is $a_1$
This means $\dfrac{-a_2}{a_1}=\sqrt{3} \Longrightarrow a_2=-\sqrt{3}a_1$.
We can now set our two equations for $a_2$ equal to each other and get $-\sqrt{3}a_1 = -\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$
Multiplying both sides by $-\frac{2}{a_1}$ immediately gives $a_1=2\sqrt{3}$
From here we could solve for $a_2$ using one of our equations and then use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the side length of the equilateral triangle, but there's a better way
We remember that the hypotenuse of our special triangle is twice as long as the shortest side of it, which has length $a_1=2\sqrt{3}$
Therefore our answer is $\boxed{4\sqrt{3}}$.
Let $[ABC]=K.$ Then $[ADC] = \frac{1}{3}K,$ and hence $[N_1DC] = \frac{1}{7} [ADC] = \frac{1}{21}K.$ Similarly, $[N_2EA]=[N_3FB] = \frac{1}{21}K.$ Then $[N_2N_1CE] = [ADC] - [N_1DC]-[N_2EA] = \frac{5}{21}K,$ and same for the other quadrilaterals
Then $[N_1N_2N_3]$ is just $[ABC]$ minus all the other regions we just computed
That is,\[[N_1N_2N_3] = K - 3\left(\frac{1}{21}K\right) - 3\left(\frac{5}{21}\right)K = K - \frac{6}{7}K = \boxed{\frac{1}{7}\triangle ABC}.\]
From the condition that $\mathcal L$ is tangent to $P_1$ we have that the system of equations $ax + by = c$ and ${y = x^2 + \frac{101}{100}}$ has exactly one solution, so $ax + b(x^2 + \frac{101}{100}) = c$ has exactly one solution
A quadratic equation with only one solution must have discriminant equal to zero, so we must have $a^2 - 4\cdot b \cdot (\frac{101}{100}b - c) = 0$ or equivalently $25a^2 -101b^2 + 100bc = 0$
Applying the same process to $P_2$, we have that $a(y^2 + \frac{45}4) + by = c$ has a unique root so $b^2 - 4\cdot a \cdot (\frac{45}4a - c) = 0$ or equivalently $b^2 - 45a^2 + 4ac = 0$
We multiply the first of these equations through by $a$ and the second through by $25b$ and subtract in order to eliminate $c$ and get $25a^3 + 1125 a^2b - 101ab^2 - 25b^3 = 0$
We know that the slope of $\mathcal L$, $-\frac b a$, is a rational number, so we divide this equation through by $-a^3$ and let $\frac b a = q$ to get $25q^3 +101q^2 - 1125q - 25 = 0$
Since we're searching for a rational root, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to search all possibilities and find that $q = 5$ is a solution
(The other two roots are the roots of the quadratic equation $25q^2 + 226q +5 = 0$, both of which are irrational.) Thus $b = 5a$
Now we go back to one of our first equations, say $b^2 - 45a^2 + 4ac = 0$, to get $25a^2 - 45a^2 + 4ac = 0 \Longrightarrow c = 5a$
(We can reject the alternate possibility $a = 0$ because that would give $a = b = 0$ and our "line" would not exist.) Then $a : b : c = 1 : 5 : 5$ and since the greatest common divisor of the three numbers is 1, $a = 1, b = 5, c = 5$ and $a + b + c = \boxed{11}$.

From adjacent sides, the following relationships can be derived:
\begin{align*} DC &= EC + 1\\ AE &= AF + 1\\ BD &= BF + 2 \end{align*}
Since $BF = EC$, and $DC = BF + 1$, $BD = DC + 1$
Thus, $BC = BD + DC = BD + (BD - 1)$
$26 = 2BD$
Thus, $BD = 13/1$
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{14}$.
Let $\angle{AB'C'} = \theta$
By some angle chasing in $\triangle{AB'E}$, we find that $\angle{EAB'} = 90^{\circ} - 2 \theta$
Before we apply the law of sines, we're going to want to get everything in terms of $\sin \theta$, so note that $\sin \angle{EAB'} = \sin(90^{\circ} - 2 \theta) = \cos 2 \theta = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \theta$
Now, we use law of sines, which gives us the following:
$\frac{\sin \theta}{5}=\frac{1 - 2 \sin^2 \theta}{23} \implies \sin \theta = \frac{-23 \pm 27}{20}$, but since $\theta < 180^{\circ}$, we go with the positive solution
Thus, $\sin \theta = \frac15$.
Denote the intersection of $B'C'$ and $AE$ with $G$
By another application of the law of sines, $B'G = \frac{23}{\sqrt{24}}$ and $AE = 10\sqrt{6}$
Since $\sin \theta = \frac15, GE = \frac{115}{\sqrt{24}}$, and $AG = AE - GE = 10\sqrt{6} - \frac{115}{\sqrt{24}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{24}}$
Note that $\triangle{EB'G} \sim \triangle{C'AG}$, so $\frac{EG}{B'G}=\frac{C'G}{AG} \implies C'G = \frac{25}{\sqrt{24}}$.
Now we have that $AB = AE + EB = 10\sqrt{6} + 23$, and $B'C' = BC = B'G + C'G = \frac{23}{\sqrt{24}} + \frac{25}{\sqrt{24}} = \frac{48}{\sqrt{24}}=4\sqrt{6}$
Thus, the area of $ABCD$ is $(10\sqrt{6} + 23)(4\sqrt{6}) = 92\sqrt{6} + 240$, and our final answer is $92 + 6 + 240 = \boxed{338}$.
Using the identity $\cos A + \cos B + \cos C = 1+\frac{r}{R}$, we have that $\cos A + \cos B + \cos C = \frac{21}{16}$
From here, combining this with $2\cos B = \cos A + \cos C$, we have that $\cos B = \frac{7}{16}$ and $\sin B = \frac{3\sqrt{23}}{16}$
Since $\sin B = \frac{b}{2R}$, we have that $b = 6\sqrt{23}$
By the Law of Cosines, we have that:\[b^2 = a^2 + c^2-2ac\cdot \cos B \implies a^2+c^2-\frac{7ac}{8} = 36 \cdot 23.\]But one more thing: noting that $\cos A = \frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2cb}$
and $\cos C = \frac{a^2+b^2-c^2}{2ab}$, we know that $\frac{36 \cdot 23 + b^2+c^2-a^2}{bc} + \frac{36 \cdot 23+a^2+b^2-c^2}{ab} = \frac{7}{4} \implies$ $\frac{36 \cdot 23 + c^2-a^2}{c} + \frac{36 \cdot 23 + a^2-c^2}{a} = \frac{21\sqrt{23}}{2} \implies$ $\frac{(a+c)(36 \cdot 23 + 2ac-c^2-a^2)}{ac} = \frac{21\sqrt{23}}{2}$
Combining this with the fact that $a^2+c^2 - \frac{7ac}{8} = 36 \cdot 23$, we have that: $\frac{(a+c)(-2ac \cdot \frac{7}{16}+2ac)}{ac} = \frac{21\sqrt{23}}{2} \implies$ $a+c = \frac{28 \sqrt{23}}{3}$
Therefore, $s$, our semiperimeter is $\frac{23\sqrt{23}}{3}$
Our area, $r \cdot s$ is equal to $\frac{115\sqrt{23}}{3}$, giving us a final answer of $\boxed{141}$.
Let the altitude from $P$ onto $AE$ at $Q$ have lengths $PQ = h$ and $AQ = r$
It is clear that, for a given $r$ value, $AP$, $BP$, $CP$, $DP$, and $EP$ are all minimized when $h = 0$
So $P$ is on $AE$, and therefore, $P = Q$
Thus, $AP$=r, $BP = |r - 1|$, $CP = |r - 2|$, $DP = |r - 4|$, and $EP = |r - 13|.$ Squaring each of these gives:
$AP^2 + BP^2 + CP^2 + DP^2 + EP^2 = r^2 + (r - 1)^2 + (r - 2)^2 + (r - 4)^2 + (r - 13)^2 = 5r^2 - 40r + 190$
This reaches its minimum at $r = \frac {40}{2\cdot 5} = 4$, at which point the sum of the squares of the distances is $\boxed{110}$.
As we are dealing with volumes, the ratio of the volume of $P'$ to $P$ is the cube of the ratio of the height of $P'$ to $P$.
Thus, the height of $P$ is $\sqrt [3]{8} = 2$ times the height of $P'$, and thus the height of each is $12$.
Thus, the top of the frustum is a rectangle $A'B'C'D'$ with $A'B' = 6$ and $B'C' = 8$.
Now, consider the plane that contains diagonal $AC$ as well as the altitude of $P$
Taking the cross section of the frustum along this plane gives the trapezoid $ACC'A'$, inscribed in an equatorial circular section of the sphere
It suffices to consider this circle.
First, we want the length of $AC$
This is given by the Pythagorean Theorem over triangle $ABC$ to be $20$
Thus, $A'C' = 10$
Since the height of this trapezoid is $12$, and $AC$ extends a distance of $5$ on either direction of $A'C'$, we can use a 5-12-13 triangle to determine that $AA' = CC' = 13$.
Now, we wish to find a point equidistant from $A$, $A'$, and $C$
By symmetry, this point, namely $X$, must lie on the perpendicular bisector of $AC$
Let $X$ be $h$ units from $A'C'$ in $ACC'A'$
By the Pythagorean Theorem twice,\begin{align*} 5^2 + h^2 & = r^2 \\ 10^2 + (12 - h)^2 & = r^2 \end{align*}Subtracting gives $75 + 144 - 24h = 0 \Longrightarrow h = \frac {73}{8}$
Thus $XT = h + 12 = \frac {169}{8}$ and $m + n = \boxed{177}$.
The perpendicular bisector of any chord of any circle passes through the center of that circle
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{AC}$, and $R$ be the length of the radius of $\omega$
By the Power of a Point Theorem, $MD \cdot (2R - MD) = AM \cdot MC = 24^2$ or $0 = MD^2 -2R\cdot MD 24^2$
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $AD^2 = MD^2 + AM^2 = MD^2 + 24^2$.
Let's compute the circumradius $R$: By the Law of Cosines, $\cos B = \frac{AB^2 + BC^2 - CA^2}{2\cdot AB\cdot BC} = \frac{43^2 + 13^2 - 48^2}{2\cdot43\cdot13} = -\frac{11}{43}$
By the Law of Sines, $2R = \frac{AC}{\sin B} = \frac{48}{\sqrt{1 - \left(-\frac{11}{43}\right)^2}} = \frac{86}{\sqrt 3}$ so $R = \frac{43}{\sqrt 3}$.
Now we can use this to compute $MD$ and thus $AD$
By the quadratic formula, $MD = \frac{2R + \sqrt{4R^2 - 4\cdot24^2}}{2} = \frac{43}{\sqrt 3} + \frac{11}{\sqrt3} = 18\sqrt{3}$
(We only take the positive sign because angle $B$ is obtuse so $\overline{MD}$ is the longer of the two segments into which the chord $\overline{AC}$ divides the diameter.) Then $AD^2 = MD^2 + 24^2 = 1548$ so $AD = 6\sqrt{43}$, and $12 < 6 + \sqrt{43} < 13$ so the answer is $\boxed{12}$.
Since $C$ is the trisector of line segment $\overline{AB}$ closer to $A$, the $y$-coordinate of $C$ is equal to two thirds the $y$-coordinate of $A$ plus one third the $y$-coordinate of $B$
Thus, point $C$ has coordinates $(x_0, \frac{2}{3} \ln 1 + \frac{1}{3}\ln 1000) = (x_0, \ln 10)$ for some $x_0$
Then the horizontal line through $C$ has equation $y = \ln 10$, and this intersects the curve $y = \ln x$ at the point $(10, \ln 10)$, so $x_3 = \boxed{10}$.
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles
Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$
Let $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $150^\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.

Triangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $DP = \frac12$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac12\right)$, so $\cos 150^\circ = \boxed{-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.
To find the vertices of the triangle, we find where the two lines $y=2x-4$ and $y=-3x+16$ intersect
Solving $2x-4=-3x+16$, we get $x=4$
Substituting $x=4$ back into $y=2x-4$, we find $y=4$
Therefore, $(4,4)$ is one of the vertices of the triangle
The other two vertices are the $y$-intercepts of the two lines, namely $(0,16)$ and $(0,-4)$
Taking the side joining $(0,16)$ and $(0,-4)$ as the base of the triangle, we find that the area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(\text{base})(\text{height})=\frac{1}{2}(16-(-4))(4)=\boxed{40}$ square units.

The circumference of the whole circle is $2 \pi \cdot 6 = 12 \pi$, so the circumference of the base of the cone is $12 \pi/3 = 4 \pi$
Hence, the radius of the base of the cone is $4 \pi/(2 \pi) = 2$.

Let $x = 14.8$ and $y = 28.3$
Then the volume of cone $A$ is \[\frac{1}{3} \pi x^2 y,\] and the volume of cone $B$ is \[\frac{1}{3} \pi y^2 x,\] so the desired ratio is \[\frac{\frac{1}{3} \pi x^2 y}{\frac{1}{3} \pi xy^2} = \frac{x}{y} = \frac{14.8}{28.3} = \boxed{\frac{148}{283}}.\]
First of all, the third side of the smaller triangle cannot be 10 inches because sides of 10, 10 and 20 inches would not form a triangle
The smaller triangle must have sides of 10, 20 and 20 inches
If the shortest side of the similar triangle is 50 inches, then the other two sides are 100 inches and 100 inches
Thus, the perimeter of the larger triangle is $50 + 100 + 100 = \boxed{250\text{ inches}}$.
If a line can be drawn tangent to a circle a the point $(5,5)$, then it must be possible to draw a radius from the center of the circle to the point $(5,5)$
This radius will have a slope of: $$\frac{5-2}{5-3}=\frac{3}{2}$$ A key fact to remember is that tangents to a circle at a certain point are perpendicular to radii drawn from the center of the circle to that point
This diagram summarizes that fact: [asy]
draw(Circle((0,0),sqrt(13)),linewidth(.8));

draw((0,0)--(2,3),linewidth(.8));
draw((2-0.3,3+0.2)--(2-0.5,3-0.1)--(2-0.2,3-0.3));
[/asy] Therefore, the slope of the tangent will be the negative inverse of the slope of the radius, which is equal to $\boxed{-\frac{2}{3}}$.
Since $\overline{DE} \parallel \overline{AC}$ and $\overline{EF} \parallel \overline{AB},$ triangles $\triangle BDE$ and $\triangle EFC$ are similar to $\triangle ABC$, and so they are also isosceles
That is, $BD = DE$ and $EF = FC.$
Then the perimeter of $ADEF$ is \[\begin{aligned} AD + DE + EF + AF &= AD + BD + FC + AF \\ &= AB + AC \\ &= 25 + 25 \\ &= \boxed{50}
\end{aligned}\]

Because $\triangle BCD$ is a right triangle, we know that $\tan B = \frac{CD}{BC}$.
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $BC = \sqrt{BD^2 - CD^2} = \sqrt{13 - 9} = \sqrt{4} = 2$.
Then $\tan B = \frac{CD}{BC} = \boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$.
Since $\angle RIP$ is inscribed in arc $RP$, the measure of arc $RP$ is $2\angle RIP = 72^\circ$
Therefore, arc $RP$ is $\frac{72}{360} =\frac15$ of the circumference of the whole circle
The circle's circumference is $2OR\pi = 20\pi$ cm, so the length of arc $RP$ is $\frac15\cdot 20\pi = \boxed{4\pi}$ cm.
Angles $\angle DCB$ and $\angle B$ are alternate interior angles, so they are congruent
Therefore, $m\angle B=40^\circ$.
Since $AC=BC$, triangle $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles with equal angles at $A$ and $B$
Therefore, $m\angle A=40^\circ$.
Finally, $\angle A$ and $\angle ECD$ are corresponding angles, so $m\angle ECD=m\angle A = \boxed{40}$ degrees.
The shaded region consists of 8 copies of the checkered region in the figure below
The area of this region is the difference between the area of a quarter-circle and the area of an isosceles right triangle
The area of the quarter-circle is $\frac{1}{4}\pi (4)^2=4\pi$ square units, and the area of the isosceles right triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(4)(4)=8$ square units
Therefore, the area of the checkered region is $4\pi-8$ square units, and the area of the shaded region is $8(4\pi-8)=\boxed{32\pi-64}$ square units

If one angle of the parallelogram is 120 degrees, then another angle between adjacent sides has measure $180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ$
Shown in the diagram above, let the parallelogram be $ABCD$, with $\overline{AD}$ one of the short sides
Drawing the altitude from $D$ to $\overline{AB}$ gives us 30-60-90 triangle $AXD$, from which we find $XD = (AD/2)\sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3}$, so the area of $ABCD$ is $(AB)(XD) = \boxed{60\sqrt{3}}$.
Let the length of the pipes be $h$
The volume of the 10-inch pipe is $\pi (5^2) (h) = 25\pi h$ cubic inches and the volume of each 2-inch pipe is $\pi (1^2)(h) = \pi h$ cubic inches
Hence we see it takes exactly 25 2-inch pipes to match the volume of one 10-inch pipe
The answer is $\boxed{25}$ pipes.

[/asy] By drawing in radii to the tangent line, we have formed two right triangles, one with hypotenuse $x$ and the other with hypotenuse $15-x$
Notice that the angles at the $x$ axis are vertical angles and are also congruent
So, these two triangles are similar, and we can set up a ratio: $$\frac{x}{15-x}=\frac{2}{7}$$ $$7x=30-2x$$ $$9x=30$$ $$x=\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}$$
Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle
Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=10$
Let $K$ denote the area of $\triangle ABC$.
Heron's formula tells us that \begin{align*}
K &= \sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\
&= \sqrt{10\cdot 3\cdot 3\cdot 4} \\
&= 6\sqrt{10}.
\end{align*}
The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\sqrt{10} = r\cdot 10,$$ which yields the radius $r=\boxed{\frac{3\sqrt{10}}{5}}$.
We will also adopt the notation $|\triangle XYZ|$ to represent the area of $\triangle XYZ$.
Recall that if two triangles have their bases along the same straight line and they share a common vertex that is not on this line, then the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of the lengths of their bases.
Using this fact, $$\frac{|\triangle AEF|}{|\triangle DEF|}=\frac{AF}{FD}=\frac{3}{1}.$$Thus, $$|\triangle AEF|=3\times |\triangle DEF|=3(17)=51.$$Then, $$|\triangle AED|=|\triangle AEF|+|\triangle DEF|=51+17=68.$$Also, $$\frac{|\triangle ECD|}{|\triangle AED|}=\frac{EC}{AE}=\frac{2}{1}.$$Thus, $$|\triangle ECD|=2\times |\triangle AED|=2(68)=136.$$Then, $$|\triangle DCA|=|\triangle ECD|+|\triangle AED|=136+68=204.$$Since $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $$\frac{|\triangle BDA|}{|\triangle DCA|}=\frac{BD}{DC}=\frac{1}{1}.$$Then, $|\triangle BDA|=|\triangle DCA|=204$ and $$|\triangle ABC|=|\triangle BDA|+|\triangle DCA|=204+204=\boxed{408}.$$

Above is the diagram implied by the problem, with some added lines ($O$ is the center of the circle)
Since $\triangle AMB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and $AB=9$, $AM=4.5\sqrt{3}$
Since $AO$ is $2/3$ of $AM$, $AO=3\sqrt{3}$
Thus, the area of the circle is $\pi(3\sqrt{3})^2=\boxed{27\pi}$.

Taking $ABC$ to be the base of pyramid $ABCH$, the height is $HD$
Since $ABC$ is half unit square $ABCD$, the area of $ABC$ is $\frac12$
Therefore, the volume of pyramid $ABCH$ is \[\frac{[ABC]\cdot HD}{3} = \frac{(1/2)(1)}{3} = \boxed{\frac16}.\]
Reflecting a point across the $x$-axis multiplies its $y$-coordinate by $-1$
Therefore, $D'=(4,-1)$
To reflect $D'$ across the line $y=x+1$, we first translate both the line and the point down one unit so that the equation of the translated line is $y=x$ and the coordinates of the translated point are $(4,-2)$
To reflect across $y=x$, we switch the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate to obtain $(-2,4)$
Translating this point one unit up, we find that $D''=\boxed{(-2,5)}$.
The two possible diagonal lengths are $AB$ and $AC$
The measure of an interior angle of a regular hexagon is $180(6-2)/6=120$ degrees
Therefore, angle $BCA$ measures $120/2=60$ degrees
Also, the base angles of the isosceles triangle with the marked 120-degree angle each measure $(180-120)/2=30$ degrees
This implies that $\angle CBA$ is a right angle, so triangle $ABC$ is a 30-60-90 triangle
Therefore, the ratio of $AB$ to $AC$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$

Because the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, they divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles
Let $x$ be half of the length of the shorter diagonal of the rhombus
Then $x+3$ is half of the length of the longer diagonal
Also, $x$ and $x+3$ are the lengths of the legs of each of the right triangles
By the Pythagorean theorem,  \[
x^2+(x+3)^2=\left(\sqrt{89}\right)^2.
\] Expanding $(x+3)^2$ as $x^2+6x+9$ and moving every term to the left-hand side, the equation simplifies to $2x^2+6x-80=0$
The expression $2x^2+6x-80$ factors as $2(x-5)(x+8)$, so we find $x=5$ and $x=-8$
Discarding the negative solution, we calculate the area of the rhombus by multiplying the area of one of the right triangles by 4
The area of the rhombus is $4\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5(5+3)\right)=\boxed{80}$ square units.

The longest side of the triangle either has length $15$ or has length $k.$ Take cases:
If the longest side has length $15,$ then $k \le 15.$ The triangle must be nondegenerate, which happens if and only if $15 < 11 + k,$ or $4 < k,$ by the triangle inequality
Now, for the triangle to be obtuse, we must have $15^2 > 11^2 + k^2,$ or $15^2 - 11^2 = 104 > k^2,$ which gives $k\leq 10$ (since $k$ is an integer)
Therefore, the possible values of $k$ in this case are $k = 5, 6, \ldots, 10.$
If the longest side has length $k,$ then $k \ge 15.$ In this case, the triangle inequality gives $k < 15 + 11,$ or $k < 26.$ For the triangle to be obtuse, we must have $k^2 > 11^2 + 15^2 = 346,$ or $k \ge 19$ (since $k$ is an integer)
Therefore, the possible values of $k$ in this case are $k = 19, 20, \ldots, 25.$
In total, the number of possible values of $k$ is $(10 - 5 + 1) + (25 - 19 + 1) = \boxed{13}.$
The center of the circle, $O$, is the midpoint of the chord $AB$ (the diameter of the circle)
Since we are told that $CD$ is parallel to $AB$, if we draw a line that is perpendicular to $AB$, it will be perpendicular to $CD$ as well
Now let's draw a segment from $O$ to the midpoint of the chord $CD$, which we will call $X$, and another segment from $O$ to $D$
Now we have right triangle $OXD$ as shown:   [asy]

[/asy] We are told that chord $CD$ is 8 units long
Since $X$ is the midpoint of chord $CD$, both $CX$ and $XD$ must be 4 units long
We are also told that circle $O$ has a radius of 6 units
This means that $OD$ must be 6 units long
Because we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $OX$
We get  \begin{align*}
OX^{2}+XD^{2}&=OD^{2}\\
OX^{2}&=OD^{2}-XD^{2}\\
OX&=\sqrt{OD^{2}-XD^{2}}\\
OX&=\sqrt{6^2-4^2}\\
OX&=\sqrt{20}.
\end{align*} Now let's draw a segment from $D$ to a point $Y$ on segment $KA$ that is perpendicular to both $CD$ and $KA$
We get $DY$, drawn in red in the following diagram:  [asy]

[/asy] Since $DY$ forms right triangle $DYO$, which is congruent to $\triangle OXD$, we get that $DY$ is $\sqrt{20}$ units long
Now we can use the formula for a triangle, $\mbox{area}=\frac{1}{2}\mbox{base}\cdot\mbox{height}$ to get the area of $\triangle KDC$
We get  \begin{align*}
\mbox{area}&=\frac{1}{2}\cdot8\cdot\sqrt{20}\\
&=4\cdot\sqrt{20}\\
&=4\cdot2\sqrt{5}\\
&=\boxed{8\sqrt{5}}.

[/asy] First, we find the side length of the equilateral triangle
$M$ is the midpoint of $EF$; let $MF=x$, so $AM=MC=x\sqrt{3}$ and $AC=2x\sqrt{3}$
$AC$ is the diagonal of $ABCD$ and thus has length $10\sqrt{2}$
So we have \[2x\sqrt{3}=10\sqrt{2}.\]  It follows that the side length of the triangle is $2x=\frac{10\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3}}$.
Now, look at diagonal $BD$ and notice that it is made up of twice the diagonal of the small square plus the side length of the triangle
Let the side length of the small square be $y$, so we have  \[BD=BE+EF+FD=y\sqrt{2}+\frac{10\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3}}+y\sqrt{2}=10\sqrt{2}.\]   Solving yields $y\sqrt{2}=5\sqrt{2}-\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3}}$ so $y=\boxed{5-\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.

Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be the areas of $\triangle ADE,$ $\triangle BDC,$ and $\triangle ABD,$ respectively
The area of $\triangle ABE$ is \[\frac 1 2\cdot 4\cdot 8= 16= x+z,\]and the area of $\triangle BAC$ is \[\frac 1 2\cdot 4\cdot 6 = 12= y+z.\]Subtracting these equations gives $$(x+z) - (y+z) = 16-12\implies x - y = \boxed{4}.$$
We can divide the pentagon into 7 equilateral triangles of side length 2.

The area of each equilateral triangle is \[\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot 2^2 = \sqrt{3},\]so the area of pentagon $ABCDE$ is $\boxed{7 \sqrt{3}}$.
We first consider an equilateral triangle with side length $s$
If we construct an altitude, it will divide the equilateral triangle into two congruent $30-60-90$ triangles with the longest side having length $s$ and the altitude opposite the $60^\circ$ angle
Since the side lengths of a $30-60-90$ triangle are in a $1:\sqrt{3}:2$ ratio, the altitude will have length $\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}$
Since the base of this equilateral triangle is $s$, its area will be $\frac{1}{2}{b}{h}=\frac{1}{2}s \left(\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)=\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}$.
Now we can set this expression equal to $64\sqrt{3}$ and solve for $s$ to find the side length of our original triangle
Doing this, we get that $\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}=64\sqrt{3}$
We can then multiply both sides of the equation by $\frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}$ to get that $s^2=256$
Taking the square root of both sides, we find that $s=16$, so the original triangle had a side length of $16$ cm
If we decrease this by $4$ cm, we get that the new triangle has side length $12$ cm and therefore has an area of $\frac{144 \sqrt{3}}{4}=36\sqrt{3}$ cm
Therefore, the area is decreased by $64\sqrt{3}-36\sqrt{3}=\boxed{28\sqrt{3}}$ cm.
Suppose the cube rolls first over edge $AB$.
Consider the cube as being made up of two half-cubes (each of dimensions $1 \times 1 \times \frac{1}{2}$) glued together at square $PQMN$
(Note that $PQMN$ lies on a vertical plane.)
Since dot $D$ is in the centre of the top face, then $D$ lies on square $PQMN$

[/asy] So we can convert the original three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional problem of this square slice rolling.
Square $MNPQ$ has side length 1 and $DQ=\frac{1}{2}$, since $D$ was in the centre of the top face.
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $MD^2 = DQ^2 + QM^2 = \frac{1}{4}+1= \frac{5}{4}$, so $MD = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}$ since $MD>0$
In the first segment of the roll, we start with $NM$ on the table and roll, keeping $M$ stationary, until $Q$ lands on the table

dot((-0.5, 1));
// Draw arc
draw(reverse(arc((0, 0), (1, 0.5), (-0.5, 1))), dashed, MidArcArrow(size=6));
[/asy] This is a rotation of $90^\circ$ around $M$
Since $D$ is at a constant distance of $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}$ from $M$, then $D$ rotates along one-quarter (since $90^\circ$ is $\frac{1}{4}$ of $360^\circ$) of a circle of radius $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}$, for a distance of $\frac{1}{4}\left( 2\pi\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4}\pi$.
In the next segment of the roll, $Q$ stays stationary and the square rolls until $P$ touches the table

// Draw outline

dot((0, 0.5));
// Draw arc
draw(reverse(arc((0, 0), (0.5, 0), (0, 0.5))), dashed, MidArcArrow(size=6));
[/asy] Again, the roll is one of $90^\circ$
Note that $QD = \frac{1}{2}$
Thus, again $D$ moves through one-quarter of a circle this time of radius $\frac{1}{2}$,  for a distance of $\frac{1}{4}\left( 2\pi \frac{1}{2}\right) =\frac{1}{4}\pi$.
Through the next segment of the roll, $P$ stays stationary and the square rolls until $N$ touches the table
This is similar to the second segment, so $D$ rolls through a distance of $\frac{1}{4}\pi$.
Through the next segment of the roll, $N$ stays stationary and the square rolls until $M$ touches the table
This will be the end of the process as the square will end up in its initial position
This segment is similar to the first segment so $D$ rolls through a distance of $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{4}\pi$.
Therefore, the total distance through which the dot travels is  $$\frac{\sqrt{5}}{4}\pi+\frac{1}{4}\pi+\frac{1}{4}\pi+\frac{\sqrt{5}}{4}\pi$$or $$\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)\pi,$$so our final answer is $\boxed{\dfrac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}$.
We begin by finding the equation of the line $\ell$ containing $(1,7)$ and $(13,16)$
The slope of $\ell$ is $\frac{16-7}{13-1} = \frac{9}{12} = \frac 34$, so the line has the point-slope form $y - 7 = \frac 34 (x - 1)$
Substituting the value $x = 5$, we obtain that $y = 7 + \frac 34 (5-1) = 10$
It follows that the point $(5,10)$ lies on the line containing $(1,7)$ and $(13,16)$ (for $k = 10$, we obtain a degenerate triangle)
To minimize the area of the triangle, it follows that $k$ must either be equal to $9$ or $11$.
Indeed, we claim that both such triangles have the same area
Dropping the perpendiculars from $(5,9)$ and $(5,11)$ to $\ell$, we see that the perpendiculars, $\ell$, and the line segment connecting $(5,9)$ to $(5,11)$ form two right triangles
By vertical angles, they are similar, and since they both have a hypotenuse of length $1$, they must be congruent
Then, the height of both triangles must be the same, so both $k = 9$ and $k = 11$ yield triangles with minimal area
The answer is $9 + 11 = \boxed{20}$.
First, we can create a square with the points $O$ and $E$ as opposite corners
Label the other two points as $X$ and $Y$ with $X$ on $OC$ and $Y$ on $OB$
We get that $X$ is $(4,0)$ and $Y$ is $(0,4)$.
We can find the area of the figure by finding the area of the square and the two triangles created.
The area of the square is $4 \cdot 4 =16.$
The two triangles are right triangles
The first one, $XCE$, has legs $XC$ and $XE$ of length $4$, so the area is $\frac{4 \cdot 4}{2}=8$.
To find the area of the other triangle, we must find the coordinates of $B (0,y)$
The slope of $BE$ is of slope $-2$
Therefore, $\frac{y-4}{0-4}=-2$.
Solving for $y$, we get $y=12.$ Then, the leg of the second triangle $BY$ is $12-4=8$
The area of the triangle $YEB$ is thus $\frac{8 \cdot 4}{2}=16.$
Adding the areas of the three areas together, $16+16+8=\boxed{40}.$
By Pythagoras, $\angle ABC = 90^\circ$
Let $P$ and $Q$ be the projections of $D$ onto $BC$ and $AB$, respectively.

[/asy]
We have that $\angle ABC = 90^\circ$ and $\angle PBD = 45^\circ$, so quadrilateral $BPDQ$ is a square
Let $x$ be the side length of this square.
Then $PC = BC - BP = 4 - x$, and $AQ = AB - QB = 3 - x$
Triangles $AQD$ and $DPC$ are similar, so \[\frac{AQ}{QD} = \frac{DP}{PC},\]or \[\frac{3 - x}{x} = \frac{x}{4 - x}.\]Solving for $x$, we find $x = 12/7$
Then $BD = x \sqrt{2} = 12/7 \cdot \sqrt{2}$, so the answer is $\boxed{\frac{12}{7}}$.
Since $RSP$ is a straight line, we have $\angle RSQ+\angle QSP = 180^\circ$, so $\angle RSQ=180^\circ - 80^\circ = 100^\circ$
$\triangle RSQ$ is isosceles with $RS=SQ$, so \[ \angle RQS = \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - \angle RSQ) = \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - 100^\circ)=40^\circ
\]Similarly, since $\triangle PSQ$ is isosceles with $PS=SQ$, we have \[ \angle PQS = \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - \angle PSQ) = \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - 80^\circ)=50^\circ
\]Therefore, $\angle PQR = \angle PQS + \angle RQS = 50^\circ+40^\circ=\boxed{90}^\circ$.
The piece that is removed from the original pyramid to create the frustum is itself a square pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid
The ratio of corresponding side lengths is 1/2, so the piece that was removed has volume $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$ of the volume of the original pyramid
Therefore, the remaining frustum has volume $1-(1/8) = {7/8}$ of the original pyramid.
The original pyramid has base area $12^2 = 144$ square cm, so its volume is $144\cdot 8/3 = 48\cdot 8$ cubic centimeters
Therefore, the frustum has volume \[\frac{7}{8}\cdot (48\cdot 8) = 48\cdot 7 = \boxed{336}\text{ cubic centimeters}.\]
The diagonals of a parallelogram intersect at the midpoint of each diagonal
So, we simply find the midpoint of $(1,-5)$ and $(11,7)$, which is $\left(\frac{1+11}{2}, \frac{-5+7}{2}\right)=\boxed{(6,1)}$.
Connect opposite pairs of vertices of the regular hexagon with line segments as shown
Since each angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees, the six triangles produced are equilateral
The diameter of the circle circumscribed around the hexagon is equal to twice the side length of each of the triangles
Therefore, each triangle has side length 2 units
The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ units is $s^2\sqrt{3}/4$ square units
(To show this, divide the equilateral triangle into two smaller 30-60-90 triangles.)  Substituting $s=2$, we find that the area of each triangle is $\sqrt{3}$ square units
Therefore, area of the hexagon is $\boxed{6\sqrt{3}}$ square units.

draw((1.333,.666)--(.666,1.333), blue+linewidth(0.6));
[/asy] Because of the symmetry inherent in the grid and the two triangles (which are both isosceles), these three blue segments divide the blue triangle into congruent smaller triangles
The blue triangle contains 9 of these congruent smaller triangles.
The region of overlap of the two triangles is a hexagonal region
As per the diagram above, this hexagonal region contains 6 of these congruent smaller triangles
Thus, the area of the hexagonal region is $6/9=2/3$ of the area of one of the isosceles triangles
We compute the area of one isosceles triangle as follows:
size(100);

[/asy] Label points $A,B,C,D,E,F$ as above
To compute the area of this triangle ($\triangle AEF$), notice how it is equal to the area of square $ABCD$ minus the areas of triangles $\triangle ADE$, $\triangle ABF$, and $\triangle ECF$
The square has side length 2 units, so the area of $\triangle ADE$ and $\triangle ABF$ is $\frac{1}{2}(2)(1) = 1$ and the area of $\triangle ECF$ is $\frac{1}{2}(1)(1)=\frac{1}{2}$
The area of square $ABCD$ is $2^2=4$, so the area of triangle $\triangle AEF$ is equal to $4 - 2(1) - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$.
Finally, remember that the hexagonal region has area $2/3$ of the area of the triangle, or $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 1$
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The first jar has a volume of $V=\pi r^2h=\pi(\frac{3}{2})^24=9\pi$
The second jar has a volume of $V=\pi r^2h=\pi(\frac{6}{2})^26=54\pi$
Note that the volume of the second jar is 6 times greater than that of the first jar
Because peanut butter is sold by volume, the second jar will be six times more expensive than the first jar, for an answer of $\$0.60\times6=\boxed{\$3.60}$.
By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units
Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units
There are $\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.
Starting from the right triangle that contains angle $C$, we can see the third angle in this triangle is $90-26=64$ degrees
By vertical angles, this makes the rightmost angle in the triangle containing angle $y$ also equal to 64 degrees
Thus, the third angle in that triangle has measure $180-(y+64)=116-y$ degrees
Now, we can turn our attention to the five sided figure that contains angles $A$, $B$, and $x$
By vertical angles the right most angle will be $116-y$ degrees
The angle with exterior measure of $x$ degrees will have an interior measure of $360-x$ degrees
Finally, the sum of the angles in a five sided polygon will be equal to $(5-2)180=540$ degrees
So, we can write $$A+B+360-x+90+116-y=540$$ $$28+74+360-x+90+116-y=540$$ $$\boxed{128}=x+y$$
The ratio of the sides of the small to big equilateral triangle (note that they are similar) is $1/10$, so the ratio of their areas is $(1/10)^2 = 1/100$
So the big equilateral triangle has 100 times the area of a small one, so it will take $\boxed{100}$ small triangles to cover the big one.
Note that if the $y$-coordinate of one of the two points is $2+c$, then the $y$-coordinate of the other point must be $2-c$ because the two points must be equidistant from the line $y=2$
Therefore, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the two points on circle $B$ that are also on the $y$-axis is $\boxed{4}$.
The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $AC = \sqrt{BC^2 - AB^2} = \sqrt{100 - 36} = \sqrt{64}=8$, so $\cos C = \frac{AC}{BC} = \frac{8}{10} = \boxed{\frac45}$.
We know that the two spheres are similar (in the same sense that triangles are similar) because corresponding parts are in proportion
We will prove that for two spheres that are similar in the ratio $1:k$, their volumes have the ratio $1:k^3$
Let the radius of the first sphere be $r$, so the radius of the other sphere is $kr$
The volume of the first sphere is $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ and the volume of the second sphere is $\frac{4}{3}\pi (kr)^3$
The ratio between the two volumes is  \[\frac{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3}{\frac{4}{3}\pi (kr)^3}=\frac{r^3}{k^3r^3}=\frac{1}{k^3}\] Thus, the ratio of the volumes of the two spheres is $1:k^3$.
In this problem, since the smaller sphere has $12.5\%=\frac{1}{8}$ of the volume of the larger sphere, the radius is $\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{8}}=\frac{1}{2}$ that of the larger sphere
Thus, the ratio between the two radii is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
(In general, the ratio of the volumes of two similar 3-D shapes is the cube of the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides.)

[/asy] Thanks to SAS Similarity, we see that $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF.$
Therefore, we have that: \begin{align*}
\frac{AB}{BC} &= \frac{DE}{EF} \\
\frac{AB}{3\text{ cm}} &= \frac{14\text{ cm}}{6\text{ cm}} \\
AB &= \frac{14\text{ cm}\cdot3\text{ cm}}{6\text{ cm}} = \boxed{7}\text{ cm}.

Reflecting a point over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coordinate
So if $C$ is $(-3,2)$, $C'$ will be $(3,2)$
The segment is a horizontal line of length $3+3=\boxed{6}$.
Rotating $60^\circ$ clockwise is the same as rotating $360^\circ - 60^\circ = 300^\circ$ counterclockwise, so $\sin(-60^\circ) = \sin (360^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 300^\circ$.
Let $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $300^\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.

Triangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \frac{1}{2}$ and $DP = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(\frac12,-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$, so $\sin(-60^\circ) = \sin300^\circ = \boxed{-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.
$\triangle ABC$ is a right isosceles ($45^\circ - 45^\circ - 90^\circ$) triangle, so $AC=AB\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2}$
Thus, the side length of the octagon is $\sqrt{2}$.
We can compute the octagon's area by subtracting the area of the four right isosceles triangles from the area of square $BDEF$.
The four right isosceles triangles are congruent by symmetry and each has an area of $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 1 \cdot 1$, so their total area is \[4\cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 2.\]  Each side of square $BDEF$ is comprised of a leg of a right isosceles triangle, a side of the octagon, and another leg of a different right isosceles triangle
Hence, the side length of $BDEF$ is $1+\sqrt{2}+1=2+\sqrt{2}$, and the area of $BDEF$ is \[(2+\sqrt{2})^2 = 4+2+4\sqrt{2}.\] Finally, the area of the octagon is \[4+2+4\sqrt{2} - 2 = \boxed{4+4\sqrt{2}}.\]

First, observe that the radius of the circle is $12/2=6$ units
Also, $\angle AEB$ cuts off the two arcs $\widehat{AB}$ and $\widehat{CD}$, so $m\angle AEB=(m\,\widehat{AB}-m\,\widehat{CD}) / 2$
Subsituting $m\, \widehat{AB}=180^\circ$ and $m\angle AEB=60^\circ$ into this equation, we find $m\,\widehat{CD}=60^\circ$
By symmetry, $\angle AOC$ and $\angle DOB$ are congruent, so each one measures $(180-60)/2=60$ degrees
It follows that $AOC$ and $DOB$ are equilateral triangles
Therefore, we can find the area of each shaded region by subtracting the area of an equilateral triangle from the area of a sector.
The area of sector $AOC$ is $\left(\frac{m\angle AOC}{360^\circ}\right)\pi (\text{radius})^2=\frac{1}{6}\pi(6)^2=6\pi$
The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $s^2\sqrt{3}/4,$ so the area of triangle $AOC$ is $9\sqrt{3}$
In total, the area of the shaded region is $2(6\pi-9\sqrt{3})=12\pi-18\sqrt{3}.$  Therefore, $(a,b,c)=(12,18,3)$ and $a+b+c=\boxed{33}$.
Since $CO$ is perpendicular to $OB$, we can treat $CO$ as the height of $\triangle COB$ and $OB$ as the base
The area of $\triangle COB$ is $$\frac{1}{2}\times OB\times CO = \frac{1}{2}\times(12-0)\times(p-0)=\frac{1}{2}\times12\times p=\boxed{6p}.$$
The Angle Bisector Theorem tells us that  \[\frac{AX}{AC}=\frac{BX}{BC}\] so cross multiplying and substituting tells us  \[56AX=28BX\] or $BX=2AX$.
We want to find $AX$, so we write \[50=AB=AX+XB=AX+2AX=3AX.\] Solving gives us $AX=\boxed{\frac{50}3}$.
We can divide the rolling into four phases:
Phase 1: The quarter circle pivots $90^\circ$ about point $B$

Phase 2: The quarter circle pivots $90^\circ$ about point $C$
pair A = (0,1); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (1,0);
path q = B--A..dir(45)..C--cycle;

label("$A$", A, N); label("$B$", B, S); label("$C$", C, S);
[/asy] In this phase, point $B$ is always $\frac{2}{\pi}$ cm away from point $C$, so its path is a quarter-circle with radius $\frac{2}{\pi}$
The circumference of a circle with radius $\frac{2}{\pi}$ is $2\pi(\frac{2}{\pi}) = 4$, so $B$ travels $\frac{1}{4}(4) = 1$ cm.

[/asy] In this phase, $B$ is always $\frac{2}{\pi}$ away from the ground, so its path is a straight line segment parallel to the ground
From the diagram, we see the length of this line segment is equal to the distance between the original position of $C$ and the new position of $A$
This distance is traced out by arc $CA$ as it rolls
So its length is the length of arc $CA$, which is 1 cm (since it's a quarter of a circle with radius $\frac{2}{\pi}$, a length we've already calculated)
So the path of $B$ has length 1 cm.
Phase 4: The quarter circle pivots $90^\circ$ about point $A$
pair A = (0,-1); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (-1,0);
path q = B--A..dir(-135)..C--cycle;

[/asy] As in phase 2, the path of $B$ has length 1 cm.
Putting this together, the path of point $B$ has total length $1 + 1 + 1 = \boxed{3\text{ cm}}$.
Because the perimeter of such a triangle is 23, and the sum of the two equal side lengths is even, the length of the base is odd
Also, the length of the base is less than the sum of the other two side lengths, so it is less than half of 23
Thus the $\boxed{6}$ possible triangles have side lengths 1, 11, 11; 3, 10, 10; 5, 9, 9; 7, 8, 8; 9, 7, 7 and 11, 6, 6.
Since the surface area of the original cube is 24 square meters, each face of the cube has a surface area of $24/6 = 4$ square meters, and the side length of this cube is 2  meters
The sphere inscribed within the cube has diameter 2 meters,  which is also the length of the diagonal of the cube inscribed in the sphere
Let $l$ represent the side length of the inscribed cube
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice gives \[
l^2 + l^2 + l^2 = 2^2 = 4.
\]Hence each face has surface area \[
l^2 = \frac{4}{3} \ \text{square meters}.
\]So the surface area of the inscribed cube is $6\cdot (4/3) = \boxed{8}$ square meters.
The vertices of the trapezoid are $(5,5)$, $(10,10)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,5)$
Its bases are $5$ and $10$ units long, and its height is $5$ units
Averaging the bases and multiplying by the height, we find an area of $\left(\frac{5+10}{2}\right)(5)=\boxed{37.5}$ square units.

Since the cube's volume is $5x$ cubic units, each side measures $\sqrt[3]{5x}$ units
The surface area is then $6(\sqrt[3]{5x})^2$
We are told the surface area is also $x$
We have the equation $6(\sqrt[3]{5x})^2=x$ Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\boxed{5400}$.
Define points $D$ $E$ and $F$ as shown
The area of rectangle $CDEF$ is the sum of the areas of the four triangles $BEA$, $BFC$, $CDA$, and $ABC$
The areas of the first three triangles may be found directly using the area formula $\frac{1}{2}$(base)(height)
The area of triangle $ABC$ is the area of the rectangle minus the areas of the three other triangles: $8\cdot6-\frac{1}{2}\cdot4\cdot3-\frac{1}{2}\cdot6\cdot5-\frac{1}{2}\cdot2\cdot8=\boxed{19}$.

[/asy] Since $\angle CDA=60^\circ$ and $AD=DC$, $\triangle ACD$ is an equilateral triangle, so $AC=10$ and \[[\triangle ACD]=\frac{10^2\sqrt{3}}{4}=25\sqrt{3}.\]Now we want to find $[\triangle ABC]$
To find the height of this triangle, we drop a perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$ and label the intersection point $E$: [asy]
pair A,B,C,E;
A=(0,5*sqrt(3));
B=(10-13/5,5*sqrt(3)+(1/5)*sqrt(231));

[/asy] Let $BE=h$, $CE=x$, and $EA=10-x$
Using the Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle BCE$ yields \[x^2+h^2=16\]and on $\triangle ABE$ yields \[(10-x)^2+h^2=64.\]Expanding the second equation yields $x^2-20x+100+h^2=64$; substituting $16$ for $x^2+h^2$ yields $16+100-20x=64$
Solving yields $x=\frac{13}{5}$ and $h=\sqrt{16-x^2}=\frac{\sqrt{231}}{5}$
It follows that \[[\triangle ABC]= \frac{1}{2}(BE)(AC)=\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{231}}{5}\cdot 10 = \sqrt{231}.\]Finally, \[[ABCD]=[\triangle ADC]+[\triangle ABC]=25\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{231}=\sqrt{a}+b\sqrt{c}.\]Thus we see $a=231$, $b=25$, and $c=3$, so $a+b+c=\boxed{259}$.
The sides of the triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality, so $AB + AC > BC$, $AB + BC > AC$, and $AC + BC > AB$
Substituting the side lengths, these inequalities turn into \begin{align*}
(3n - 3) + (2n + 7) &> 2n + 12, \\
(3n - 3) + (2n + 12) &> 2n + 7, \\
(2n + 7) + (2n + 12) &> 3n - 3,
\end{align*} which give us $n > 8/3$, $n > -2/3$, and $n > -22$, respectively.
However, we also want $\angle A > \angle B > \angle C$, which means that $BC > AC$ and $AC > AB$
These inequalities turn into $2n + 12 > 2n + 7$ (which is always satisfied), and $2n + 7 > 3n - 3$, which gives us $n < 10$.
Hence, $n$ must satisfy $n > 8/3$ and $n < 10$, which means \[3 \le n \le 9.\] The number of positive integers in this interval is $9 - 3 + 1 = \boxed{7}$.
Join $PQ$, $PR$, $PS$, $RQ$, and $RS$
Since the circles with centers $Q$, $R$ and $S$ are all tangent to $BC$, then $QR$ and $RS$ are each parallel to $BC$ (as the centers $Q$, $R$ and $S$ are each 1 unit above $BC$)
This tells us that $QS$ passes through $R$.
Similarly, since $P$ and $S$ are each one unit from $AC$, then $PS$ is parallel to $AC$
Also, since $P$ and $Q$ are each one unit from $AB$, then $PQ$ is parallel to $AB$
Therefore, the sides of $\triangle PQS$ are parallel to the corresponding sides of $\triangle ABC$.
When the centers of tangent circles are joined, the line segments formed pass through the associated point of tangency, and so have lengths equal to the sum of the radii of those circles
Therefore, $QR=RS=PR=PS=1+1=2$.

Since $PR=PS=RS$, we know $\triangle PRS$ is equilateral, so $\angle PSR=\angle PRS=60^\circ$
Since $\angle PRS=60^\circ$ and $QRS$ is a straight line, we have $\angle QRP=180^\circ-60^\circ=120^\circ$.
Since $QR=RP$, we know $\triangle QRP$ is isosceles, so $$\angle PQR = \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ-120^\circ)= 30^\circ.$$Since $\angle PQS=30^\circ$ and $\angle PSQ=60^\circ$, we have $$\angle QPS = 180^\circ - 30^\circ - 60^\circ = 90^\circ,$$so $\triangle PQS$ is a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle.
The angles of $\triangle ABC$ are equal to the corresponding angles of $\triangle PQS$, so $\triangle ABC$ is a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle
This means that if we can determine one of the side lengths of $\triangle ABC$, we can then determine the lengths of the other two sides using the side ratios in a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle.
Consider side $AC$
Since the circle with center $P$ is tangent to sides $AB$ and $AC$, the line through $A$ and $P$ bisects $\angle BAC$
Thus, $\angle PAC=45^\circ$
Similarly, the line through $C$ and $S$ bisects $\angle ACB$
Thus, $\angle SCA=30^\circ$

Drop perpendiculars from $P$ and $S$ to $X$ and $Z$, respectively, on side $AC$
Since $PS$ is parallel to $AC$, and $PX$ and $SZ$ are perpendicular to $AC$, we know that $PXZS$ is a rectangle, so $XZ=PS=2$.
Since $\triangle AXP$ is right-angled at $X$, has $PX=1$ (the radius of the circle), and $\angle PAX=45^\circ$, we have $AX=PX=1$
Since $\triangle CZS$ is right-angled at $Z$, has $SZ=1$ (the radius of the circle), and $\angle SCZ=30^\circ$, we have $CZ=\sqrt{3}SZ=\sqrt{3}$ (since $\triangle SZC$ is also a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle)
Thus, $AC=1+2+\sqrt{3}=3+\sqrt{3}$.
Since $\triangle ABC$ is a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle, with $\angle ACB=60^\circ$ and $\angle CAB=90^\circ$, we have $BC=2AC=6+2\sqrt{3}$, and $$AB=\sqrt{3}AC=\sqrt{3}(3+\sqrt{3})=3\sqrt{3}+3.$$Therefore, the side lengths of $\triangle ABC$ are $AC=3+\sqrt{3}$, $AB=3\sqrt{3}+3$, and $BC=6+2\sqrt{3}$
Thus, the perimeter is $$3+\sqrt{3}+3\sqrt{3}+3+6+2\sqrt{3}=\boxed{12+6\sqrt{3}}.$$

Drawing the long diagonals of a regular hexagon divides the hexagon into equilateral triangles with side length equal to half the length of each long diagonal
So, the area of the base equals 6 times the area of an equilateral triangle with side length 4
An equilateral triangle with side length 4 has area $4^2\sqrt{3}/4 = 4\sqrt{3}$, so the area of the base of the pyramid is $6(4\sqrt{3}) = 24\sqrt{3}$.
Let $O$ be the center of the hexagon, so $\overline{PO}$ is the altitude from the apex of the pyramid
Since triangle $PAD$ is an equilateral triangle, triangle $POA$ is a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse 8
$\overline{PO}$ is opposite the $60^\circ$ angle in this triangle, so $PO = 4\sqrt{3}$.
Finally, the volume of the pyramid is  \[\frac13\cdot [ABCDEF] \cdot PO = \frac13\cdot 24\sqrt{3} \cdot 4\sqrt{3} = \boxed{96}.\]
Let the sphere's radius be $r$
From the sphere's circumference we have $2\pi r = 12\pi$; solving for $r$ yields $r = 6$
The volume of the sphere is $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi (6^3) = 36\cdot 8 \pi$
The volume of one wedge is one-fourth this volume, or $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 6^2\cdot 8 \pi = 6^2\cdot 2\pi = \boxed{72\pi}$.
Let the cone have height $h$ and radius $r$, so its volume is \[\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h.\]When the cone is filled with water, the amount of water in the cone forms a smaller cone that is similar to the original cone
This smaller cone has height $\frac{3}{4}h$, and by similar triangles, radius $\frac{3}{4}r$
So, the smaller cone has volume \[\frac{1}{3}\pi \left(\frac{3}{4}r\right)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}h\right) = \frac{1}{3}\pi \cdot \frac{3^3}{4^3} r^2h.\]Hence the ratio of the volume of the water-filled cone to the original cone is \[\frac{3^3}{4^3}=\frac{27}{64}=0.421875,\]which, as a percentage, is $\boxed{42.1875}\%$.

[/asy] We label the square, triangle, and intersections as above
Triangle $BCG$ and $FDG$ are congruent triangles
The area of the shaded region $DHF$ is the area of $FGD$ minus $DGH$.
Triangle $DGH$ is similar to triangle $BGC$
We can prove this because $\angle BGC =\angle DGH$
Also, $\overline{DE}$ has slope $2$ and $\overline{BF}$ has slope $-\frac12$, which are negative reciprocals, so the two lines are perpendicular and create the right angle $\angle GHD$
Therefore, $\angle GHD = \angle BCG = 90^{\circ}$
Since the two triangles have two of the same angle measures, they are similar
Therefore, we have the ratios $\frac{GD}{BG}=\frac{GH}{CG}=\frac{DH}{BC}$
We can find that $BG$ using the Pythagorean formula
\begin{align*}
BC^2+CG^2 &= BG^2 \\
5^2+10^2 = 125 &= BG^2 \\
BG &= 5\sqrt5.
\end{align*} Therefore, we have $\frac{5}{5\sqrt5}=\frac{1}{\sqrt5}=\frac{GH}{5}=\frac{DH}{10}$
We solve for the length of the two legs of triangle $DGH$ to find that $GH=\sqrt{5}$ and $DH=2\sqrt{5}$
Therefore, the area of triangle $DGH$ is $\frac{\sqrt5 \cdot 2\sqrt5}{2}=5$.
The area of triangle $DGF$ is $\frac{5 \cdot 10}{2}=25$
We subtract the area of $DGH$ from the area of $DGF$ to find the area of the shaded region to get $25-5=\boxed{20 \text{ sq units}}$.
Let $h = AD$

Since we are considering the incenter, $\triangle BYX$ is isosceles, and indeed is equilateral
Therefore $\angle BYX=60^\circ$
This tells us  \[180^\circ=\angle AYB=\angle AYX+\angle BYX=\angle AYX+60^\circ.\]Solving gives $\angle AYX=\boxed{120^\circ}$.
Amy's cylinder has a height of 8 and a base circumference of 6
Let her cylinder have volume $V_A$ and radius $r_A$; we have $2\pi r_A = 6$ so $r_A = 3/\pi$ and $V_A = \pi r_A ^2 h = \pi (3/\pi)^2 (8) = 72/\pi$.
Belinda's cylinder has a height of 6 and a base circumference of 8
Similarly, let her cylinder have volume $V_B$ and radius $r_B$; we have $2\pi r_B = 8$ so $r_B = 4/\pi$ and $V_B = \pi r_B^2 h = \pi (4/\pi)^2 (6) = 96/\pi$.
The positive difference between the volume of the two tubes is $96/\pi - 72/\pi = 24/\pi$ cubic inches; $\pi$ times this difference is $\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.
The base of the triangle lies on the $y$-axis, and is 5 units long
The height of the triangle is the horizontal distance from the point $(7,12)$ to the $y$-axis, and is 7 units long
Thus, the area of the triangle is $\frac{5\cdot7}{2}=\boxed{17.5}$ square units.
Plot the plots and observe that the bases of the trapezoid are $AB$ and $CD$
The area of the trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the bases times the height: $\frac{1}{2}(AB+CD)(AC)=\frac{1}{2}(2+6)(4)=\boxed{16}$ square units.

The area of the visible shaded region is equal to the area of the grid minus the area of the five circles
The diameter of the four smaller circles is equal to a side of a small square, or 2 cm, so the radius of each of the smaller circles is 1 cm
The area of all four circles is then $4\cdot\pi \cdot1^2=4\pi$
The diameter of the large circle is equal to the length of three sides of a small square, or 6 cm, so the radius of the large circle is 3 cm
The area of the large circle is then $\pi\cdot 3^2 = 9\pi$
Each side of the grid measures $5\cdot2=10$ cm, so the area of the grid is $10\cdot10=100$
The area of the visible shaded region is thus $100-4\pi-9\pi=100-13\pi$ square cm
So $A=100$, $B=13$, and $A+B=100+13=\boxed{113}$.
Because $\triangle DEF \sim \triangle ABC$, we have the equation \[\frac{AB}{DE}=\frac{BC}{EF}\] since corresponding sides are in proportion
Plugging in the lengths we know and solving for the length of $AB$, we have \[\frac{AB}{6}=\frac{18}{12}\Rightarrow AB=\frac{18}{12}\cdot6=\boxed{9}\]
Because $\triangle JKL$ is a right triangle, $\tan K = \frac{JL}{JK}$
So $\tan K = \frac{3}{2} = \frac{JL}{2}$
Then $JL = 3$.
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $KL = \sqrt{JL^2 + JK^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \boxed{\sqrt{13}}$.
Let the sphere have radius $r$
A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\pi r^2$, so we have \[324\pi = 4\pi r^2.\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$
Hence the volume of the sphere is \[\frac{4}{3}\pi(9^3)=81\cdot 3\cdot 4 \pi = \boxed{972\pi}.\]
Without loss of generality, let the side of the square have length 1 unit and let the area of triangle $ADF$ be $m$
Let $AD=r$ and $EC=s$
Because triangles $ADF$ and $FEC$ are similar, $\frac{s}{1}=\frac{1}{r}$
Since $\frac{1}{2}r=m$, the area of triangle $FEC$ is $\frac{1}{2}s=\frac{1}{2r}=\boxed{\frac{1}{4m}}$

The volume of a two-inch cube is $2^3=8$ cu inches, while that of a three-inch cube is 27 cu inches
Therefore, the weight and value of the larger cube is $\frac{27}{8}$ times that of the smaller
$\$200(\frac{27}{8})=\boxed{\$675}$.
By the triangle inequality on triangle $ABC$, $BC > AC - AB = 12 - 5 = 7$, and by the triangle inequality on triangle $BCD$, $BC > BD - CD = 20 - 8 = 12$
Hence, $BC$ must be at least $\boxed{13}$ centimeters
(And it is easy to verify that it is possible for $BC$ to be 13 centimeters.
In $\triangle ABC,$ $\angle ABC=\angle BAC,$ so $AC=BC.$
In $\triangle BCD,$ $\angle CBD=\angle CDB,$ so $CD=BC.$
Since the perimeter of $\triangle CBD$ is $19$ and $BD=7,$ then $7+BC+CD=19$ or $2(BC)=12$ or $BC=6.$
Since the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is $20,$ $BC=6,$ and $AC=BC,$ then $AB+6+6=20$ or $AB=8.$
So our final answer is $\boxed{8}.$
Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $x$, $3x$, and 15
The Triangle Inequality implies that $3x<x+15$, so $x<7.5$
Because $x$ is an integer, the greatest possible perimeter is $7+21+15=\boxed{43}$.
Since $\widehat{BC}$ is $\frac{60}{360}=\frac16$ of the circle, $\widehat{BC}$ has length $\frac16(60)=\boxed{10}$ feet.
Let $x$ be the number of degrees in $\angle A$
Then $\angle C=4x^\circ$, and $\angle B$ is also $4x^\circ$ (since $\angle B$ is congruent to $\angle C$).
Since the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$, we have $$x + 4x + 4x = 180,$$ which we can solve for $x=20$
Therefore, $\angle B = 4\cdot 20 = \boxed{80}$ degrees.
Let the three dimensions of the prism (length, width, and height, although not necessarily in that order) be $x,y,z$ such that $xy = 24$, $xz = 32$, and $yz = 48$
Then the volume of the prism is $xyz$
Multiplying our three equations together and taking the square root of both sides, we find that $xyz = \sqrt{24\cdot 32\cdot 48} = \boxed{192}$ cubic centimeters.

Since $\overline{PA}$ is perpendicular to both $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AD}$, the segment $\overline{PA}$ is the altitude from the apex to the base of the pyramid
To find this length, consider right triangle $PAB$
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem gives $PA = \sqrt{PB^2 - AB^2} = 15$.
The area of the base is $[ABCD] = (AB)(BC) = 32$, so the volume of the pyramid is $\frac13(32)(15) = \boxed{160}$ cubic units.
A reflection over the $x$-axis negates the $y$-coordinate, while a reflection over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coordinate
So reflecting $C$ over the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis means we negate both coordinates to get $\boxed{(-2, -2)}$ as the coordinates of point $C''$.
Let $a,b,$ and $c$ represent the three side lengths of the triangle
The perimeter is $a+b+c=7,$ so $b+c=7-a$
We know by the Triangle Inequality that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle must be greater than the third side length
If we focus on the variable $a$, we have
\[b+c>a\quad\Rightarrow \quad 7-a>a\quad\Rightarrow \quad 3.5>a.\]We could easily replace $a$ with $b$ or $c$, so the maximum length of any of the three sides is $3$
If $a=3$, then $b+c=4$ and $b$ and $c$ could be $1$ and $3$ in some order or $2$ and $2$ in some order
If we let $a=2$ or $a=1$ and the maximum side length is $3$, we'll still end up with triangles of side lengths $(1,3,3)$ or $(2,2,3)$
There are $\boxed{2}$ different triangles.
All of our triangles in this diagram are 30-60-90 triangles
We know that the ratio of the side lengths in a 30-60-90 triangle is $1:\sqrt{3}:2.$
Since $AE = 24$ and $\angle AEB = 60^\circ$ and $AEB$ is a right triangle, then we can see that $AE$ is the hypotenuse and $BE$ is the shorter leg, so $BE = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot 24 = 12.$ Likewise, since $BE = 12$ and $\angle BEC = 60^\circ$, then $CE = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot 12 = 6$
Then, $AB = 24 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 12\sqrt{3}$ and $BC = 12 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 6\sqrt{3}.$ Continuing, we find that $CD = 6 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 3\sqrt{3}$ and $ED = 6 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 3.$
The area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles $ABE$, $BCE$ and $CDE$
Thus, \begin{align*}
\mbox{Area}
& = \frac{1}{2}(BE)(BA) + \frac{1}{2}(CE)(BC)+\frac{1}{2}(DE)(DC) \\
& = \frac{1}{2}(12)(12\sqrt{3})+\frac{1}{2}(6)(6\sqrt{3}) + \frac{1}{2}(3)(3\sqrt{3})\\
& = 72\sqrt{3}+18\sqrt{3} + \frac{9}{2}\sqrt{3}\\
& = \boxed{\frac{189}{2}\sqrt{3}}

The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $XZ= \sqrt{YZ^2 - XY^2} = \sqrt{625-576} = \sqrt{49}=7$, so $\tan Y = \frac{XZ}{XY} = \ \boxed{\frac{7}{24}}$.
The original prism has 5 faces, 9 edges, and 6 vertices
If the new pyramid is added to a triangular face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, and 3 new faces
If instead the new pyramid is added to a quadrilateral face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 4 new edges, and 4 new faces
So, we maximize the sum by adding a pyramid to a quadrilateral face
This gives us a solid with $5-1+4 = 8$ faces, $9+4=13$ edges, and $6 + 1 = 7$ vertices
The sum of these is $\boxed{28}$.

We have $\tan R = \frac{PQ}{PR}$ and $\cos Q = \frac{PQ}{QR} = \frac{PQ}{15}$, so $\tan R = 5\cos Q$ gives us $\frac{PQ}{PR} = 5\cdot \frac{PQ}{15} = \frac{PQ}{3}$
From $\frac{PQ}{PR} = \frac{PQ}{3}$, we have $PR = 3$
Finally, the Pythagorean Theorem gives us \begin{align*}
PQ & = \sqrt{QR^2 - PR^2} \\
&=\sqrt{15^2 - 3^2}\\
&=\sqrt{(5\cdot 3)^2 - 3^2} \\
&= \sqrt{25\cdot 3^2 - 3^2} \\
&= \sqrt{24\cdot 3^2} \\
&= \sqrt{6\cdot 4\cdot 3^2} \\
&= \boxed{6\sqrt{6}}.

[/asy] Since $\angle BAD = \angle CAD$ by definition and $\angle ABC = \angle ACB$ since $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, we can see that $\angle ADB = \angle ADC = 90^\circ.$ Therefore, we see that $AD \perp BC,$ which means that $ID$ is an inradius
What's more, we can find $ID$ using the Pythagorean Theorem, since we have $IC = 18$ and $CD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 30 = 15.$
Therefore, $ID = \sqrt{IC^2 - CD^2} = \sqrt{18^2 - 15^2} = \sqrt{99} = \boxed{3\sqrt{11}}.$
The line through $A$ and $B$ has slope $\frac{0-8}{2-0}=-4$ and passes through $(0,8)$, so thus has equation $y=-4x+8$
The line through $A$ and $C$ has slope $\frac{0-8}{8-0}=-1$ and passes through $(0,8)$, so thus has equation $y=-x+8$.
The point $T$ is the point on the line $y=-4x+8$ with $y$-coordinate $t$
To find the $x$-coordinate, we solve $t=-4x+8$ to get $4x = 8-t$ or $x = \frac{1}{4}(8-t)$
The point $U$ is the point on the line $y=-x+8$ with $y$-coordinate $t$
To find the $x$-coordinate, we solve $t=-x+8$ to get $x = 8-t$.
Therefore, $T$ has coordinates $(\frac{1}{4}(8-t),t)$, $U$ has coordinates $(8-t,t)$, and $A$ is at $(0,8)$.
$TU$ is horizontal and has length $(8-t)-\frac{1}{4}(8-t)=\frac{3}{4}(8-t)$ and the distance from $TU$ to $A$ is $8-t$, so the area in terms of $t$ is \[\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{3}{4}(8-t)\right)(8-t) = \frac{3}{8}(8-t)^2.\]Since this equals $13.5$, we have $\frac{3}{8}(8-t)^2 = 13.5$ or $(8-t)^2 = \frac{8}{3}(13.5)=36$
Because line segment $TU$ is below $A$, $t<8$, and so $8-t>0$
Therefore, $8-t=6 \Rightarrow t=8-6=\boxed{2}$.
Since triangle $ABC$ is isosceles (both $AC$ and $BC$ are radii), $CD$ is perpendicular to $AB$
We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the radius: $(16/2)^2 + 10^2 = R^2$, so $R^2 = 164$
The area is $\pi R^2 = \boxed{164 \pi \mbox{ square feet}}$.
Since $AD$ is an angle bisector, $\angle BAI = \angle BAC/2$
Since $BE$ is an angle bisector, $\angle ABI = \angle ABC/2$
As an angle that is external to triangle $ABI$, $\angle AIE = \angle BAI + \angle ABI = \angle BAC/2 + \angle ABC/2$.

Since $\angle ACB = 38^\circ$, \[\angle AIE = \frac{\angle BAC + \angle ABC}{2} = \frac{180^\circ - \angle ACB}{2} = \frac{180^\circ - 38^\circ}{2} = \boxed{71^\circ}.\]
Since there are 12 congruent edges on a cube, each edge has length $60/12=5$ cm

The cube has volume $4^3=64$ cubic feet
The cylinder has radius 2, height 4, and volume $\pi(2^2)(4)=16\pi$ cubic feet
It follows that when the cylindrical section is removed from the solid, the remaining volume is $\boxed{64-16\pi}$ cubic feet.
The height of the pyramid is $12$ inches, so the height of the box must be at least $12$ inches
The base of the pyramid is $10$ inches on each side, so the minimum dimensions of the length and width of the box must be $10$
Since we want a cube-shaped box, we need to choose the dimensions of the box so that everything will fit inside
Because $12>10$, we want a cube-shaped box that measures $12$ inches on each side
(If we chose a box that measured $10$ inches on each side, it wouldn't be able to accommodate the height of the pyramid.) Therefore, the volume of the box is $12^3=\boxed{1728}$ inches cubed.

Let $F$ be the center of the square base and $M$ be the midpoint of an edge of the square, as shown
Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFM$ is a right triangle
We are given $PF = 12$, and we have $FM = (1/2)(AB) = 5$, so the Pythagorean Theorem gives us $PM = \sqrt{PF^2 + FM^2} = 13$
Therefore, since the four lateral faces are congruent triangles, the total surface area of the pyramid is \[[ABCD] + 4[PAB] = 10^2 + 4(13)(10)/2 = \boxed{360}\text{ square centimeters}.\]
Square each side length to obtain $2u-1$, $2u+1$, and $4u$
Notice that the first two expressions, $2u-1$, $2u+1$, sum to give the third
Therefore, the sides of the triangle satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, and the triangle is a right triangle
The measure of the largest angle in a right triangle is $\boxed{90}$ degrees.
The ratio of the area of triangle $ABD$ to the area of triangle $ACD$ is $BD/CD$
By the angle bisector theorem, $BD/CD = AB/AC = 16/24 = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
Rotating the point $(1,0)$ by $0^\circ$ counterclockwise about the origin gives us the point $(1,0)$, so $\sin 0^\circ = \boxed{0}$.
The total length of the fence is 4 times the perimeter of one of the triangles
Therefore, the perimeter of the large equilateral corral is 4 times the perimeter of one of the small equilateral triangles
Recall that if any linear dimension (such as radius, side length, height, perimeter, etc.) of a two-dimensional figure is multiplied by $k$ while the shape of the figure remains the same, the area of the figure is multiplied by $k^2$
In this case, the perimeter of the small equilateral triangle is multiplied by 4 to obtain the large equilateral triangle, so the area of the larger triangle is $4^2=16$ times greater than that of the small triangle
Therefore, the ratio of the original area to the new area is four small triangles divided by 16 small triangles, which simplifies to $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
By Pythagoras, triangle $ABC$ is right with $\angle B = 90^\circ$
Then the area of triangle $ABC$ is $1/2 \cdot AB \cdot BC = 1/2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 6$.
Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, the areas of triangles $BCG$, $CAG$, and $ABG$ are all one-third the area of triangle $ABC$, namely $6/3 = 2$.
We can view $PG$ as the height of triangle $BCG$ with respect to base $BC$
Then \[\frac{1}{2} \cdot GP \cdot BC = 2,\]so $GP = 4/BC = 4/4 = 1$
Similarly, $GQ = 4/AC = 4/5$ and $GR = 4/AB = 4/3$
Therefore, $GP + GQ + GR = 1 + 4/5 + 4/3 = \boxed{\frac{47}{15}}$.
Let $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $120^\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.

Triangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \frac{1}{2}$ and $DP = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$, so $\tan 120^\circ =\frac{\sin 120^\circ}{\cos 120^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{-1/2} = \boxed{-\sqrt{3}}$.
Let $\overline{BD}$ be an altitude of the isosceles $\triangle ABC$, and let $O$ denote the center of the  circle with radius $r$ that passes through $A$, $B$, and $C$, as shown.

Then \[
BD = \sqrt{3^2 - 1^2} = 2\sqrt{2}\quad\text{and}\quad OD = 2\sqrt{2} - r.
\] Since $\triangle ADO$ is a right triangle, we have \[
r^2 = 1^2 + \left(2\sqrt{2} - r\right)^2 = 1 + 8 -4\sqrt{2}r + r^2,
\quad\text{and}\quad r = \frac{9}{4\sqrt{2}} = \frac{9}{8}\sqrt{2}.
\] As a consequence, the circle has area \[
\left( \frac{9}{8}\sqrt{2}\right)^2\pi = \boxed{\frac{81}{32}\pi}.
Let $BC = s$
We can see that $AD$ consists of the altitudes from $A$ and $D$ to $BC$, each of which has length $s\sqrt{3}/2$
Thus, $AD = s\sqrt{3}$
Therefore, $AD\div BC = s\sqrt{3}/s = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}$.
Rotating the point $(1,0)$ about the origin by $0^\circ$ counterclockwise gives us the point $(1,0)$, so $\tan 0^\circ = \frac{\sin 0^\circ}{\cos 0^\circ} = \frac{0}{1} = \boxed{0}$.
Recognizing that all our triangles in the diagram are 30-60-90 triangles, we recall that the ratio of the longer leg to the hypotenuse in such a triangle is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
Therefore, we can see that: \begin{align*}
AB & = 24 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 12\sqrt{3}\\
BC & = 12 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 6\sqrt{3}\\
CD & = 6 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 3\sqrt{3}\\
ED & = 6 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 3
\end{align*} The perimeter of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is equal to $AB+BC+CD+DA$ and $DA=DE+EA$, so the perimeter is $12\sqrt{3}+6\sqrt{3}+3\sqrt{3}+3+24 = \boxed{27+21\sqrt{3}}$.
Let the medians intersect at point $G$ as shown below

Point $G$ is the centroid of $\triangle ABC$, so $AG:GD = BG:GE = 2:1$
Therefore, $AG = \frac23(AD) = 10$ and $BG = \frac23(BE) = \frac{40}{3}$.
Drawing all three medians of a triangle divides the triangle into six triangles with equal area
In $\triangle ABC$ above, $\triangle ABG$ consists of two of these six triangles, so the area of $\triangle ABC$ is 3 times the area of $\triangle ABG$: \[ [ABC] = 3[ABG] = 3\cdot \frac12 \cdot AG \cdot BG = \frac32\cdot 10 \cdot \frac{40}{3} = \boxed{200}.\]
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $ABC$ gives $BA=10$
Since $\triangle DBE\sim\triangle ABC$, $$\frac{BD}{BA}=\frac{DE}{AC}.\qquad{\rm So}\qquad
BD=\frac{DE}{AC}(BA)=\frac 46(10)=\boxed{\frac{20}{3}}.$$
Quadrilateral $KLMN$ is a square because it has $90^{\circ}$ rotational symmetry, which implies that each pair of adjacent sides is congruent and perpendicular
Since $ABCD$ has sides of length 4 and $K$ is $2\sqrt{3}$ from side $\overline{AB}$,  the length of the diagonal $\overline{KM}$  is $4 + 4\sqrt{3}$
Since the area of a square is half the product of its diagonals, the area is \[
\frac{1}{2}(4 + 4\sqrt{3})^2 = \boxed{32 + 16\sqrt{3}}.

Triangle $POD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, so $DO = DP = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$, so $\cos 135^\circ = \boxed{-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}$.
Mark segments $BF$ and $DE$ and label their intersection $P$
Now, slide sector $FPE$ on to sector $DB$ and slide sector $FPD$ on to sector $EB$
The shaded region is now a rectangle with side lengths $1$ and $2$, thus the area of the shaded region is $\boxed{2}$.
If any linear dimension (such as radius, side length, height, etc.) of a closed, two-dimensional figure is multiplied by $k$ while the shape of the figure remains the same, the area of the figure is multiplied by $k^2$
Since the area is multiplied by 4 in going from the smaller triangle to the larger triangle, we have $k^2=4$ which implies $k=2$
Therefore, each linear dimension is multiplied by 2, so the height of the larger triangle is $(3\text{ cm})\times2=\boxed{6}$ centimeters.
When point $A$ is reflected over the $x$-axis, we get point B, which is $(3,-4)$
Reflecting point $B$ over the line $y=x$, we get that point $C$ is $(-4,3)$
The distance between $A$ and $B$ is 8
The distance from point $C$ to the line connecting $A$ and $B$ is 7
Now we can draw the following diagram: [asy]
draw((0,8)--(0,-8),Arrows);
draw((8,0)--(-8,0),Arrows);
label("$y$",(0,8),N);
label("$x$",(8,0),E);

dot((-4,3));
label("$C$",(-4,3),W);
draw((3,4)--(3,-4)--(-4,3)--cycle);
draw((-4,3)--(3,3),linetype("8 8"));
[/asy] We find that the triangle has a height of length 7 and a base of length 8
Therefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is equal to  $$\frac{1}{2}bh=\frac{1}{2}\cdot7\cdot8=\boxed{28}.$$
Since $5>4$, $4$ cannot be the length of the hypotenuse
Thus either $4$ and $5$ are the lengths of the two smaller sides, or $5$ is the hypotenuse, meaning the two smaller sides are $4$ and $3$
In this latter case, the area will be smaller, so the area is $\frac{(3)(4)}{2} = \boxed{6}$.
Let the triangle have vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$, let $O$ be the center of the circle, and let $D$ be the midpoint of $
\overline{BC}$
Triangle $COD$ is a $30 - 60 - 90$ degree triangle
If $r$ is the radius of the circle, then the sides of $\triangle COD$ are $r$, $\frac{r}{2}$, and $\frac{r\sqrt{3}}{2}$
The perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is $6\displaystyle\left(\frac{r \sqrt{3}}{2}\displaystyle\right)=3r\sqrt{3}$, and the area of the circle is $\pi r^{2}$
Thus $3r\sqrt{3} = \pi r^{2}$, and $r =
\boxed{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{\pi}}$.

If two similar triangles have side ratios of $r : 1,$ the ratio of their areas must be $r^2 : 1.$ That means that when a triangle is tripled to form a new triangle, the new triangle has 9 times the area of the original
That means the original triangle must have an area of $\dfrac{54\text{ ft}^2}{9} = \boxed{6}\text{ ft}^2.$
Since $BC = 8$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $BM = CM = 4$
But $AM = 4$, so $M$ is the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$
Furthermore, $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, so $\angle BAC = 90^\circ$.

Then by Pythagoras on right triangle $ABC$, $AC = \sqrt{BC^2 - AB^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 5^2} = \sqrt{64 - 25} = \boxed{\sqrt{39}}$.
Since $RPS$ is a straight line, then $\angle SPQ = 180^\circ - \angle RPQ = 180^\circ - 3y^\circ$.
Using the angles in $\triangle PQS$, we have $\angle PQS + \angle QSP + \angle SPQ = 180^\circ$
Thus, $x^\circ+2y^\circ + (180^\circ - 3y^\circ) = 180^\circ$ or $x-y+180 = 180$ or $x=y$.
(We could have instead looked at $\angle RPQ$ as being an external angle to $\triangle SPQ$.)
Since $x=y$, then $\angle RQS=2y^\circ$.
Since $RP=PQ$, then $\angle PRQ=\angle PQR=x^\circ = y^\circ$

[/asy] Therefore, the angles of $\triangle RQS$ are $y^\circ$, $2y^\circ$ and $2y^\circ$.
Thus, $y^\circ+2y^\circ+2y^\circ=180^\circ$ or $5y=180$ or $y=36$.
Therefore, $\angle RPQ=3y^\circ = 3(36)^\circ=108^\circ$, so our final answer is $\boxed{108}$ degrees.
Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle
Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=24$
Let $K$ denote the area of $\triangle ABC$.
Heron's formula tells us that \begin{align*}
K &= \sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\
&= \sqrt{24\cdot 2\cdot 12\cdot 10} \\
&= \sqrt{24^2\cdot 10} \\
&= 24\sqrt{10}.
\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$24\sqrt{10} = r\cdot 24,$$which yields the radius $r=\boxed{\sqrt{10}}$.

label("$D$",D,E);
label("$E$",EE,N);
label("$F$",F,W);

[/asy]
Therefore, $\triangle HAC$ is equilateral, so $\sin \angle HAC = \sin 60^\circ = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.
Let $x$ be the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle
Then the black area is $\frac{1}{2}(x)(x)=\frac{1}{2}x^2$
The white area is $6-x^2$
Solving $\frac{1}{2}x^2=6-x^2$, we find $x^2=4$, so $x=2$
The distance from A to its original position is the length of a hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs have length $x$
Therefore, A is $\boxed{2\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters from its original position.
The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$
Here, we have $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3=36\pi$
Dividing both sides by $\frac{4}{3}\pi$ yields $r^3 = 27$; cube rooting both sides yields $r=3$
The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\pi r^2$; here, our surface area is $4\pi(3^2)=\boxed{36\pi}$.
Rotating $360^\circ$ is the same as doing nothing, so rotating $3645^\circ$ is the same as rotating $3645^\circ - 10\cdot 360^\circ = 45^\circ$
Therefore, $\tan(-3645^\circ) = \tan (-45^\circ)$.
Rotating $45^\circ$ clockwise is the same as rotating $360^\circ - 45^\circ = 315^\circ$ counterclockwise, so $\tan(-45^\circ) = \tan (360^\circ - 45^\circ) = \tan 315^\circ$.
Let $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $315^\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.

Triangle $POD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, so $DO = OP = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$, so $\tan(-3645^\circ) = \tan (-45^\circ) = \tan 315^\circ = \frac{\sin 315^\circ}{\cos 315^\circ} = \frac{-\sqrt{2}/2}{\sqrt{2}/2} = \boxed{-1}$.
If a prism has 2 bases and $L$ lateral faces, then each base is an $L$-gon, so the two bases collectively have $2L$ edges
Also, there are $L$ edges connecting corresponding vertices of the two bases, for a total of $3L$ edges
Solving $3L=15$, we find that the prism has 5 lateral faces and hence $5+2=\boxed{7}$ faces in total.
Use the area formula $\frac{1}{2}(\text{base})(\text{height})$ with $AB$ as the base to find the area of triangle $ABC$
We find $AB=7-(-3)=10$ by subtracting the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$
Let $D$ be the foot of the perpendicular line drawn from $C$ to line $AB$
We find a height of $CD=1-(-3)=4$ by subtracting the $y$-coordinates of $C$ and $D$
The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(10)(4)=\boxed{20\text{ square units}}$.

[/asy] By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $s^2+s^2=5^2$, so $2s^2=25$ and $s^2=\frac{25}{2}$, so the area of the square is $\frac{25}{2}=12.5$.
size(85);
draw(circle((1,1),1.414));

[/asy] Since the diameter of the circle is $5$, its radius is $\frac{5}{2}$, and its area is $\pi \displaystyle\left(\frac{5}{2}\displaystyle\right)^2 = \frac{25}{4}\pi$, which is approximately $19.63$.
The difference between the two areas is approximately $19.63 - 12.5 = 7.13$, which, to the nearest tenth, is $7.1$
Thus the area of the circle is greater than the area of the square by $\boxed{7.1}$ square inches.
The seven points divide the circumference of the circle into seven equal small arcs each with measure $\frac{360^\circ}{7}$.
$\angle ACE$ cuts off a minor arc $\widehat{AE}$, which consists of three small arcs and thus \[\widehat{AE}=3\cdot \frac{360^\circ}{7}.\]It follows that \[\angle ACE = 3\cdot \frac{360^\circ}{7} \cdot\frac{1}{ 2} = \frac{3\cdot 180^\circ}{7}.\]Each tip of the star is formed by an angle which cuts off three small arcs in a similar fashion
Thus each tip of the star measures $\frac{3\cdot 180^\circ}{7}$ and hence all seven tips of the star together measure $3\cdot 180^\circ = \boxed{540}$ degrees.
To make the $8$ triangles have the same area, the base must be divided into $8$ segments of length $1$ inch each
Define points $A$, $B_0$, $B_1$, $B_2$, $B_3$, and $B_4$ as in the figure
For $0\leq k\leq 3$, the perimeter $P(k)$ of triangle $A B_k B_{k+1}$ in inches is \[
P(k)=1+\sqrt{10^2+k^2}+\sqrt{10^2+(k+1)^2},
\]where each distance $A B_k$ is calculated by applying the Pythagorean theorem to right triangle $A B_0 B_k$
Since $P(k)$ increases as $k$ increases, its largest value is $P(3)=1+\sqrt{100+3^2}+\sqrt{100+4^2}$, which to the nearest hundredth is $\boxed{22.21}$ inches

$BG$ is a diagonal along one face of the cube
Since this diagonal splits the square face into two $45-45-90$ triangles, the diagonal is $\sqrt{2}$ times longer than a side of the square, so a side of the square measures $5\sqrt{2}/\sqrt{2}=5$ units
Thus, the volume of the cube is $5^3=\boxed{125}$ cubic units.

It follows that $\triangle BDE$ is a $45-45-90$ triangle and $\triangle CDE$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle
It follows that $BE = DE$ and $CE = DE/\sqrt{3}$, so $$s = BC = BE + EC = DE + DE/\sqrt{3} = DE \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right).$$It follows that $DE = \frac{s}{1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{s}{\frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{1 + \sqrt{3}},$ so $CE = DE/\sqrt{3} = \frac{s}{1+\sqrt{3}}$ and $CD = 2CE = \frac{2s}{1+\sqrt{3}}$.
Since triangles $ADB$ and $CDB$ share the same height, it follows that the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases, namely $AD/CD$
Since $AD = s - CD$, then $$\frac{AD}{CD}= \frac{s}{CD} - 1 = \frac{s}{\frac{2s}{1+\sqrt{3}}} - 1 = \frac{1+\sqrt{3}}{2} - 1 = \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{2}.$$Thus, the ratio of the area of triangle $ADB$ to the area of triangle $CDB$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}- 1}{2}}$.

[/asy] Let the radius of the circle be $r$
Then segment $AC$ has length $2r$
Recall that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it cuts
Because $AC$ is a diameter of the circle, arcs $ADC$ and $ABC$ both have measure 180 degrees
Thus, angles $D$ and $B$ have measure half that, or 90 degrees
Thus, they are both right angles
Now we know that triangle $ADC$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle and that triangle $ABC$ is a 45-45-90 right triangle.
We can use the ratios of the sides in these special triangles to determine that  \begin{align*}
CD&=\frac{AC}{2}=\frac{2r}{2}=r \\
AD&=DC\sqrt{3}=r\sqrt{3} \\
AB&=\frac{AC}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{2r}{\sqrt{2}}=r\sqrt{2} \\
BC&=AB=r\sqrt{2}.
\end{align*}Now we can find the areas of triangles $ADC$ and $ABC$
\begin{align*}
A_{ADC}&=\frac{1}{2}(r)(r\sqrt{3})=\frac{r^2\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
A_{ABC} &=\frac{1}{2}(r\sqrt{2})(r\sqrt{2})=\frac{1}{2}(2r^2)=r^2.
\end{align*}Thus, the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of triangles $ADC$ and $ABC$
\[A_{ABCD}=\frac{r^2\sqrt{3}}{2} + r^2=r^2\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+1\right)=r^2\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}+2}{2}\right).\]The area of the circle is $\pi r^2$
Thus, the ratio of the area of $ABCD$ to the area of the circle is \[\frac{r^2\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}+2}{2}\right)}{\pi r^2}=\frac{\cancel{r^2}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}+2}{2}\right)}{\pi \cancel{r^2}}=\frac{\sqrt{3}+2}{2\pi}.\]Thus, $a=2$, $b=3$, and $c=2$
Finally, we find $a+b+c=2+3+2=\boxed{7}$.

[/asy] $ABCD$ is a rectangle by symmetry of the square over line $AB.$ Thus, $\angle BAD = 90$ degrees
Since $\angle BAD = \angle BFE,$ we have $\triangle BFE \sim \triangle BAD.$ Since the diagonals of $ABCD$ bisect each other, $BE=BD/2,$ so the triangles are similar in a $1:2$ ratio
Thus, $FE$ is half the length of $AD,$ or $4/2=2$ cm.
The area of triangle $ABE$ is $$\frac{AB\cdot FE}{2}=\frac{8\cdot2}{2}=8.$$ The other half of the shaded region is identical and has the same area, so the entire shaded region has area $2\cdot8=\boxed{16}$ square cm.
We also might take a clever rearrangement approach

The surface area of a cube with edge length 8 inches is $6(8\text{ in.})^2=\boxed{384}$ square inches.
The x and y axis of this graph break it down into four triangles each with the same area
We find that the x and y intercepts of this graph are $(0,5)$, $(0,-5)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$
This means that the area of each triangle is $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot5\cdot10=25.$$ Therefore, the total area is $4\cdot25=\boxed{100}$ square units.
Completing the square, the equation of the circle can be rewritten in the form \[
(x^2-12x +36) +y^2=64,
\]or $(x-6)^2 +y^2 =8^2.$ The center of this circle is $(6,0)$, so both the $x$-axis and the line $y=6-x$ pass through the center of the circle: [asy]

[/asy] Since the line $y=6-x$ has slope $-1,$ it makes an angle of $135^\circ$ with the positive $x-$axis, so the desired region makes up $\frac{135^\circ}{360^\circ} = \frac{3}{8}$ of the circle
The radius of the circle is $\sqrt{64} = 8$, so the circle has area $8^2\pi = 64\pi$
Therefore, the desired area is $64\pi\cdot\frac{3}{8}=\boxed{24 \pi}$.
There are 10 cubes, thus, there are 10 sq
units in each of the faces facing towards us and away from us
The figure has a height of 3, so there 6 sq
units total in each of the vertical sides
And the figure has a total width of 4 cubes, so despite the fact that there is overlap, there is still a horizontal width of 4, making for 4 sq
units in each of the horizontal sides, making 8 total sq
Thus, there is a total of $10 + 10 + 8 + 6 = \boxed{34\text{ sq
units}}$.
Suppose Billy starts at point $A$, turns at point $B$, and ends at point $D$, as shown below
If Billy turns $60^{\circ}$ northward and walks six miles, then we can draw a $30-60-90$ triangle whose hypotenuse is $6$ miles (triangle $BCD$ below).

It follows that Billy traveled $6/2 = 3$ miles eastward during these $6$ miles, and that he traveled $3 \cdot \sqrt{3}$ miles northward during these $6$ miles
In total, Billy traveled $4 + 3 = 7$ miles eastward and $3\sqrt{3}$ miles northward
By the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance from his starting point is $\sqrt{(7)^2 + (3\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{49 + 27} = \sqrt{76} = \boxed{2\sqrt{19}}.$
Draw a diagonal of the rectangle
By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the diagonal is $\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$ centimeters

First of all, we calculate that the length of $\overline{DC}$ is $17.8 - 5 = 12.8$
Since triangles $ADB$ and $BDC$ are similar, $BD/AD$ is equal to $CD/BD$, giving us the equation $x/5 = 12.8/x$
Multiplying both sides by $5x$, we get $x^2 = 64$, so $x = \boxed{8}$ units.
Our current triangle lengths are 8, 15, and 17
Let us say that $x$ is the length of the piece that we cut from each of the three sticks
Then, our lengths will be $8 - x,$ $15 - x,$ and $17 - x.$ These lengths will no longer form a triangle when the two shorter lengths added together is shorter than or equal to the longest length
In other words, $(8 - x) + (15 - x) \leq (17 - x).$ Then, we have $23 - 2x \leq 17 - x,$ so $6 \leq x.$ Therefore, the length of the smallest piece that can be cut from each of the three sticks is $\boxed{6}$ inches.
Let $F$ be a point on $\overline{AC}$ such that $\overline{DF}$ is parallel to $\overline{BE}$

Because $\triangle ATE$ and $\triangle ADF$ are similar, we have \[
\frac{DF}{x} = \frac{AD}{AT} = \frac{4}{3},\]and \[DF=\frac{4x}{3}.
\]Also, $\triangle BEC$ and $\triangle DFC$ are similar, so \[
\frac{CD}{BC} =\frac{DF}{BE} = \frac{4x/3}{5x} = \frac{4}{15}.
\]Thus \[
\frac{CD}{BD} = \frac{CD/BC}{1-(CD/BC)}= \frac{4/15}{1- 4/15}= \boxed{\frac{4}{11}}.
Since triangle $DGF$ is similar to triangle $AHF$, we have \[
\frac{DG}{GF}=\frac{AH}{HF}.
\] Substituting we find \[
\frac{DG}{3}=\frac{10}{10+3},
\] which we solve to get $DG=30/13$ inches
The area of triangle $DGF$ is $\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{30}{13}\right)(3)=\frac{45}{13}$ square inches
The area of the $3\text{ in.}\times3\text{ in.}$ square is $9$ square inches, so the area of the shaded region is $9-\frac{45}{13}=\boxed{\frac{72}{13}}$ square inches.
We have $x<6+5=11$ and $x>6-5=1$, so the possible values of $x$ are from $2$ to $10$, and their difference is $10-2 = \boxed{8}$.
Since the cube has six sides, each of area $2^2 = 4$, the surface area of the cube is 24
Since Joe's paint will exactly cover the cube and it will also exactly cover the sphere, the sphere also must have surface area 24.
If $r$ is the radius of the sphere, this tells us that \[ 4 \pi r^2 = 24 , \]or $r^2 = 6/\pi$, so \[ r = \sqrt{6/\pi} = \sqrt{6}/\sqrt{\pi}
\]Therefore the volume of the sphere is \[ \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 =\frac{4}{3} \pi \Bigl( \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \Bigr)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot \frac{6 \sqrt{6}}{\pi \sqrt{\pi}}
= \frac{8 \sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{\pi}}
\]Thus $\boxed{K=8}$.
Without loss of generality, suppose that $BA < BC$
Since $BD$ is the angle bisector of $\angle B$, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, it follows that $$\frac{AD}{CD} = \frac{BA}{BC} = \frac 34.$$ Thus, $AD < CD$, so $CD$ is the longer subsegment of $AC$
Solving for $AD$, it follows that $AD = \frac{3CD}{4}$
Also, we know that $AD + CD = AC = 10$, and substituting our previous value for $AD$, we find that $\frac{3CD}{4} + CD = \frac {7CD}4 = 10 \Longrightarrow CD = \boxed{\frac {40}7}$ inches.
Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle
Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=9$
Let $K$ denote the area of $\triangle ABC$.
Heron's formula tells us that \begin{align*}
K &= \sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\
&= \sqrt{9\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2} \\
&= \sqrt{3^3\cdot 2^3} \\
&= 6\sqrt{6}.
\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\sqrt{6} = r\cdot 9,$$which yields the radius $r=\boxed{\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}}$.

Rotating the square about its vertical line of symmetry creates a right circular cylinder with diameter 14 and height 14
Thus, the cylinder has radius $14/2=7$ and volume $\pi(7^2)(14)=\pi(50-1)(14)=\pi(700-14)=\boxed{686\pi}$.
Let $C_A= 2\pi R_A$ be the circumference of circle $A$, let $C_B= 2\pi R_B$  be the circumference of circle $B$, and let $L$ the common length of the  two arcs
Then $$
\frac{45}{360}C_A = L = \frac{30}{360}C_B.
$$Therefore $$
\frac{C_A}{C_B} = \frac{2}{3}\quad\text{so}\quad
\frac{2}{3}=\frac{2\pi R_A}{2\pi R_B} =\frac{R_A}{R_B}.
$$Thus, the ratio of the areas is $$
\frac{\text{Area of Circle }(A)}{\text{Area of Circle }(B)}
=\frac{\pi R_A^2}{\pi R_B^2} = \left(\frac{R_A}{R_B}\right)^2 =\boxed{\frac{4}{9}}.
Draw $BO$
Let $y = \angle BAO$
Since $AB = OD = BO$, triangle $ABO$ is isosceles, so $\angle BOA = \angle BAO = y$
Angle $\angle EBO$ is exterior to triangle $ABO$, so $\angle EBO = \angle BAO + \angle BOA = y + y = 2y$.

Triangle $BEO$ is isosceles, so $\angle BEO = \angle EBO = 2y$
Then $\angle EOD$ is external to triangle $AEO$, so $\angle EOD = \angle EAO + \angle AEO = y + 2y = 3y$
But $\angle EOD = 45^\circ$, so $\angle BAO = y = 45^\circ/3 = \boxed{15^\circ}$.
Let $s$ represent the length of the edge of a cube
The surface area of the cube is 6 times the area of each face (since there are 6 faces), or $6s^2$
Increasing $s$ by $50\%$ gives us $1.5s$
The new surface area is $6(1.5s)^2=6s^2(2.25)$
Increasing the surface area by $x\%$ is $6s^2\left(1+\frac{x}{100}\right)$, so we solve for $x$ when the surface area is $6s^2(2.25)$
$$2.25=1+\frac{x}{100}\qquad\Rightarrow 1.25=\frac{x}{100}\qquad\Rightarrow 125=x$$ The surface area increases by $\boxed{125\%}$.
To determine the surface area of solid $CXYZ,$ we determine the area of each of the four triangular faces and sum them.
Areas of $\triangle CZX$ and $\triangle CZY:$
Each of these triangles is right-angled and has legs of lengths 6 and 8; therefore, the area of each is $\frac{1}{2}(6)(8)=24$.
Area of $\triangle CXY:$
This triangle is equilateral with side length $6.$ We draw the altitude from $C$ to $M$ on $XY.$ Since $\triangle CXY$ is equilateral, then $M$ is the midpoint of $XY.$
Thus, $\triangle CMX$ and $\triangle CMY$ are $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangles
Using the ratios from this special triangle, $$CM = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(CX)=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(6)=3\sqrt{3}.$$Since $XY = 6,$ the area of $\triangle CXY$ is $$\frac{1}{2}(6)(3\sqrt{3})=9\sqrt{3}.$$Area of $\triangle XYZ:$
We have $XY = 6$ and $XZ = YZ = 10$ and drop an altitude from $Z$ to $XY.$ Since $\triangle XYZ$ is isosceles, this altitude meets $XY$ at its midpoint, $M,$ and we have $$XM = MY = \frac{1}{2}(XY)=3.$$By the Pythagorean Theorem,  \begin{align*}
ZM &= \sqrt{ZX^2 - XM^2} \\
&= \sqrt{10^2-3^2} \\
&= \sqrt{91}.
\end{align*}Since $XY = 6,$ the area of $\triangle XYZ$ is $$\frac{1}{2}(6)(\sqrt{91})=3\sqrt{91}.$$Finally, the total surface area of solid $CXYZ$ is $$24+24+9\sqrt{3}+3\sqrt{91}=\boxed{48+9\sqrt{3}+3\sqrt{91}}.$$
The number of degrees is the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$
If the $n$-gon is regular, then each angle measures $\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$ degrees
If $n=3$, 4, 5, 6, or 9, then $n$ divides evenly into 180, so the number of degrees in each angle is an integer
If $n=7$, then the number of degrees is $180\cdot5/7=900/7$, which is not an integer
If $n=8$, the number of degrees in each angle is $180\cdot 6/8=135$
Therefore, only $\boxed{1}$ value of $n$ between 3 and 9 results in a non-integer degree measure for each interior angle of a regular $n$-gon.
We draw the medians as shown below.

From right triangles $ACM$ and $BCN$, we have \begin{align*}
AC^2 + CM^2 &= 36,\\
BC^2 + CN^2 &= (2\sqrt{11})^2 = 44.\end{align*}
However, we have $CM = BC/2$ and $CN = AC/2$, so the equations above become \begin{align*}
AC^2 + \frac14BC^2 &= 36,\\
BC^2 + \frac14AC^2 &=44.
\end{align*}
Adding these equations gives  \[\frac54(AC^2 + BC^2) = 80,\] so $AC^2 + BC^2 = 64$
But the Pythagorean Theorem gives us $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$, so $AB^2 = 64$, which means $AB = \boxed{8}$.
A sphere with radius 9 inches has volume $\frac{4}{3}\pi(9^3)=4\cdot 9^2 \cdot 3\pi$ cubic inches; twice this is $8\cdot 9^2\cdot 3 \pi$ cubic inches
Let the radius of the larger sphere be $r$, so we have \[\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3= 8\cdot 9^2\cdot 3\pi .\] Solving for $r$ yields \[r^3 =2\cdot 9^3 \Rightarrow r = 9\sqrt[3]{2}.\]  The diameter is twice this value, or $18\sqrt[3]{2}$ inches
Hence $a=18$, $b=2$, and $a+b=\boxed{20}$.

The total volume of the eight removed cubes is $8\times 3^{3}=216$ cubic centimeters, and the volume of the original box is $15\times 10\times 8 = 1200$ cubic centimeters
Therefore the volume has been reduced by $\left(\frac{216}{1200}\right)(100\%) = \boxed{18\%}

Because $AC=\sqrt{7^2+1^2}=\sqrt{50}$, the area of $\triangle ACE$ is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\displaystyle\left(\sqrt{50}\displaystyle\right)^2=\frac{25}{2}\sqrt{3}$
The area of hexagon $ABCDEF$ is $2\displaystyle\left(\frac{25}{2}\sqrt{3}\displaystyle\right)=\boxed{25\sqrt{3}}$.
An alternate way to start: let $O$ be the center of the hexagon
Then triangles $ABC,CDE,$ and $EFA$ are congruent to triangles $AOC,COE,$ and $EOA$, respectively
Thus the area of the hexagon is twice the area of equilateral $\triangle ACE$

Also, since $OD$ points east and $OC$ points south, then $OD$ is perpendicular to $OC$
Since $HC=150$, we have  $$h^2+c^2=150^2$$ by the Pythagorean Theorem
Since $HD=130$, we have $$h^2+d^2=130^2.$$ Since $CD=140$, we have $$c^2+d^2 = 140^2.$$
Adding the first two equations, we obtain $$2h^2+c^2+d^2=150^2+130^2.$$ Since $c^2+d^2=140^2$, we have  \begin{align*}
2h^2 + 140^2 &= 150^2+130^2\\
2h^2 & = 150^2 + 130^2 - 140^2 \\
2h^2 & = 19800 \\
h^2 & = 9900\\
h & = \sqrt{9900}=30\sqrt{11}
\end{align*} Therefore, the height of the balloon above the field is $\boxed{30\sqrt{11}}$ meters.
The area of the shaded figure can be found by taking the area of the large square and then subtracting the areas of the two unshaded triangles
The square has dimensions $30$-by-$30$ so it has an area of $30\cdot 30 = 900$
Both triangles have a base and height of $20$ so their combined area is $2\cdot \frac{1}{2}bh = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}(20)(20)=400$
Therefore, the area of the shaded region is $900-400=\boxed{500}$ square units.

By the triangle inequality on triangle $ABC$, \begin{align*}
x + 8 &> 10, \\
x + 10 &> 8, \\
8 + 10 &> x,
\end{align*} which tell us that $x > 2$, $x > -2$, and $x < 18$.
By the triangle inequality on triangle $CDA$, \begin{align*}
x + 12 &> 16, \\
x + 16 &> 12, \\
12 + 16 &> x,
\end{align*} which tell us that $x > 4$, $x > -4$, and $x < 28$.
Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are $5, 6, \dots, 17$, for a total of $17 - 5 + 1 = \boxed{13}$.
To find the area of $\triangle ABC$ in terms of $p$, we find the area of $ABOQ$ and subtract out the areas of $\triangle ACQ$ and $\triangle BCO.$
Both $\overline{QA}$ and $\overline{OB}$ are horizontal, so $\overline{QA}$ is parallel to $\overline{OB}$
Thus, $ABOQ$ is a trapezoid with bases $\overline{AQ}$ and $\overline{OB}.$ Since $\overline{OQ}$ is vertical, its length is the height of the trapezoid, so the area of $ABOQ$ is $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot QO \cdot (QA+OB)=\frac{1}{2}\cdot 12 \cdot (2+12)=84.$$Since $\triangle ACQ$ has a right angle at $Q,$ its area is $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot QA\cdot QC=\frac{1}{2}\cdot (2-0)\cdot (12-p)=12-p.$$Since $\triangle COB$ has a right angle at $O,$ its area is $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot OB\cdot CO = \frac{1}{2}\cdot (12-0)\cdot (p-0)=6p.$$Thus, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $$84-6p-(12-p)=72-5p.$$Then $72-5p=27$ or $5p=45,$ so $p=\boxed{9}.$

Point $G$ is the centroid of $\triangle DEF$, so $DG:GP = EG:GQ = 2:1$
Therefore, $DG = \frac23(DP) = 12$ and $QG = \frac13(EQ) =8$, so applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $\triangle QGD$ gives us $QD = \sqrt{QG^2 + GD^2} = \sqrt{64+144} = \sqrt{16(4+9)} = 4\sqrt{13}$, which means $DF = 2 QD = \boxed{8\sqrt{13}}$.

Notice that $\overline{BP}$ bisects the right angle at $B$
Thus, the Angle Bisector Theorem tells us that $AB/BC = AP/PC = 1/2$
So, we have $AB = x$ and $BC = 2x$ for some $x$
By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $5x^2 =AC^2 = 9$, so $x^2 = \frac95$
Finally, the desired area $\frac{1}{2}(x)(2x) = x^2 = \boxed{\frac{9}{5}}$.
When Chuck has the leash extended to its full length, he can move in a $270^\circ$ arc, or $\frac{3}{4}$ of a full circle about the point where the leash is attached
(He is blocked from going further by the shed.)

The area that he can play inside this circle is $\frac{3}{4}$ of the area of a full circle of radius $3,$ or $$\frac{3}{4}\times \pi(3^2)=\frac{27}{4}\pi.$$ When the leash is extended fully to the left, Chuck just reaches the top left corner of the shed, so can go no further
When the leash is extended fully to the bottom, Chuck's leash extends $1\text{ m}$ below the length of the shed
This means that Chuck can play in more area to the left.

This area is a $90^\circ$ sector of a circle of radius $1,$ or $\frac{1}{4}$ of this circle
So this additional area is $$\frac{1}{4} \times \pi (1^2)=\frac{1}{4}\pi.$$ So the total area that Chuck has in which to play is $$\frac{27}{4}\pi + \frac{1}{4}\pi = \frac{28}{4}\pi = \boxed{7\pi}\text{ m}^2.$$
We can easily see that $\triangle ABG \sim \triangle ACF \sim \triangle ADE.$
First of all, $BD = AD - AB.$ Since $AB = \dfrac{1}{4}AD,$ we have that $BD = \dfrac{3}{4}AD.$ Since $BD$ is also $DC + CB = 15,$ we see that $AD = 20$ and $AB = 5.$ Now, we can easily find $ED = \dfrac{4}{5}AD = 16.$
Now, we see that $CA = CB + BA = 8 + 5 = 13.$ Since $\dfrac{FC}{CA} = \dfrac{ED}{DA},$ thanks to similarity, we have $FC = \dfrac{ED \cdot CA}{DA} = \dfrac{16 \cdot 13}{20} = \boxed{10.4}.$
Because the figure has rotational symmetry, $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$
Consequently, the triangles $BZQ$ and $BWQ$ have the same area because they share a height and have bases that are the same length
We have
$$[BQW]=\dfrac{1}{2}[BZW]=\dfrac{1}{2}\left([ABWZ]-[ABZ]\right)$$$$=\dfrac{1}{2}\left(120-\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot6\cdot12\right)=\dfrac{1}{2}(120-36)=\dfrac{84}{2}=\boxed{42}.$$

We add $\overline{WY}$ to our diagram and note that because $\overline{WX}\parallel\overline{ZY}$ and $\overline{WY}\perp\overline{ZY}$, we have $\overline{WY}\perp\overline{WX}$
Therefore, triangles $WYX$ and $WYZ$ are right triangles.
From right triangle $WYZ$, we have $\tan Z = \frac{WY}{ZY}$, so $WY = ZY\cdot \tan Z = 12\cdot 1.5 = 18$
From right triangle $WXY$, we have $\tan X = \frac{WY}{WX}$, so \[WX = \frac{WY}{\tan X} = \frac{18}{2} =9.\]Finally, the Pythagorean Theorem gives  \begin{align*}
XY&=\sqrt{WY^2 + WX^2} \\
&= \sqrt{18^2 + 9^2} \\
&= \sqrt{(2\cdot 9)^2 + 9^2} \\
&= \sqrt{5\cdot 9^2} \\
&= \boxed{9\sqrt{5}}.
\end{align*}
Each of the sides of the square is divided into two segments by a vertex of the rectangle
Call the lengths of these two segments $r$ and $s$
Also, let $C$ be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from $A$ to the side containing the point $B$
Since $AC=r+s$ and $BC=|r-s|$, \[
(r+s)^2+(r-s)^2=12^2,
\] from the Pythagorean theorem
This simplifies to $2r^2+2s^2=144$, since the terms $2rs$ and $-2rs$ sum to 0
The combined area of the four removed triangles is $\frac{1}{2}r^2+\frac{1}{2}s^2+\frac{1}{2}r^2+\frac{1}{2}s^2=r^2+s^2$
From the equation $2r^2+2s^2=144$, this area is $144/2=\boxed{72}$ square units

Since $\triangle AOB$ is isosceles with $AO=OB$ and $OP$ is perpendicular to $AB$, point $P$ is the midpoint of $AB$, so $AP=PB=\frac{1}{2}AB=\frac{1}{2}(12)=6$
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OP = \sqrt{AO^2 - AP^2}=\sqrt{10^2-6^2}=\sqrt{64}={8}$.
Since $ABCD$ is a trapezoid with height of length 8 ($OP$ is the height of $ABCD$) and parallel sides ($AB$ and $DC$) of length $12$ and $24$, its area is \[ \frac{1}{2}\times\,\mbox{Height}\,\times\,\mbox{Sum of parallel sides} = \frac{1}{2}(8)(12+24)=\boxed{144}
Since $XY$ cuts $AD$ and $BC$ each in half, then it also cuts the height $PO$ in half.
Thus, each of the two smaller trapezoids has height 4
Next, we find the length of $XY$
The sum of the areas of trapezoids $ABYX$ and $XYCD$ must equal that of trapezoid $ABCD$
Therefore, \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2}(4)(AB+XY)+\frac{1}{2}(4)(XY+DC)&=144\\
2(12+XY)+2(XY+24) & = 144\\
4(XY)& = 72 \\
XY & = 18
\end{align*} Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABYX$ is $\frac{1}{2}(4)(12+18)=60$ and the area of trapezoid $XYCD$ is $\frac{1}{2}(4)(18+24)=84$.
Thus, the ratio of their areas is $60:84=5:7$.
Our answer is then $5+7=\boxed{12}$.
In 30 minutes, the tip of the second hand travels 30 times around the circumference of a circle of radius 6cm
Since the circumference is $2\pi \cdot6 = 12\pi$, the tip of the second hand travels $12\pi \cdot 30 = \boxed{360\pi}$ centimeters.
Clearly, triangle $ABC$ is isosceles
This is the first
We know $\angle ABC = \angle ACB=72^{\circ}$, which tells us that $\angle BAC = 180^\circ-72^\circ-72^\circ=36^\circ$
Since segment $BD$ bisects angle $ABC$, the measure of angle $ABD$ is $72^\circ/2=36^\circ$
Thus, $\angle BAD = \angle ABD$ and $\triangle ABD$ is isosceles.
Since $\triangle ABD$ is isosceles, we see that $m\angle ADB=180^\circ-36^\circ-36^\circ=108^\circ$
Thus, $\angle BDC=180^\circ-108^\circ=72^\circ$
Looking at triangle $BDC$, we already know that $\angle DCB=72^\circ=\angle BDC$ degrees, so this triangle is isosceles.
Next, we use the fact that $DE$ is parallel to $AB$
Segment $BD$ is a transversal, so the alternate interior angles $ABD$ and $BDE$ are congruent
Thus, $m\angle ABD=m\angle BDE=36^\circ$
We already knew that $m\angle DBE=36^\circ$ since $BD$ bisects $\angle ABC$
Thus, the triangle $BDE$ is isosceles.
Looking at angle $EDF$, we can see that $m\angle EDF=180^\circ-m\angle BDA-m\angle BDE=180^\circ-108^\circ-36^\circ=36^\circ$
We also know that $EF$ is parallel to $BD$, and so the alternate interior angles $\angle BDE$ and $\angle FED$ are congruent
Thus, $m\angle FED=36^\circ$ and triangle $DEF$ is isosceles.
We have nearly found them all
We can compute that $\angle EFD=180^\circ-36^\circ-36^\circ=108^\circ$, and so $\angle EFC=180^\circ-108^\circ=72^\circ$ degrees
From the very beginning, we know that $m\angle ACB =72^\circ$, so $\triangle FEC$ is isosceles
This makes $m\angle FEC=180^\circ-72^\circ-72^\circ=36^\circ$ degrees, and so $m\angle DEC=36^\circ+36^\circ=72^\circ$
So, our final isosceles triangle is $DEC$
We have found a total of $\boxed{7}$ isosceles triangles.
Triangle $AFG$ is similar to triangle $AHI$, and  \[
\frac{AF}{AH}=\frac{3\cdot AB}{4\cdot AB}=\frac{3}{4}.
\] It follows that the ratio of the area of $\bigtriangleup AFG$ to the area of $\bigtriangleup AHI$ is $\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2=\frac{9}{16}$
Since $\bigtriangleup AFG$ takes up $\frac{9}{16}$ of the area of $\bigtriangleup AHI$, trapezoid $FGIH$ takes up the other $\frac{7}{16}$ of the area
More formally,  \begin{align*}
[AFG]+[FGIH]&=[AHI] \implies \\
\frac{[AFG]}{[AHI]}+\frac{[FGIH]}{[AHI]}&=1 \implies \\
\frac{[FGIH]}{[AHI]}&=1- \frac{[AFG]}{[AHI]} \\
&=1-\frac{9}{16} \\
&=\boxed{\frac{7}{16}}.
\end{align*}
The sides of the triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality, so $AB + AC > BC$, $AB + BC > AC$, and $AC + BC > AB$
Substituting the side lengths, these inequalities turn into \begin{align*}
(x + 4) + (3x) &> x + 9, \\
(x + 4) + (x + 9) &> 3x, \\
(3x) + (x + 9) &> x + 4,
\end{align*} which give us $x > 5/3$, $x < 13$, and $x > -5/3$, respectively.
However, we also want $\angle A$ to be the largest angle, which means that $BC > AB$ and $BC > AC$
These inequalities turn into $x + 9 > x + 4$ (which is always satisfied), and $x + 9 > 3x$, which gives us $x < 9/2$.
Hence, $x$ must satisfy $x > 5/3$, $x < 13$, $x > -5/3$, and $x < 9/2$, which means \[\frac{5}{3} < x < \frac{9}{2}.\] The answer is $9/2 - 5/3 = \boxed{\frac{17}{6}}$.
(Also, note that every value of $x$ in this interval makes all the side lengths positive.)
The entire pizza has radius 6 inches and volume $\pi (6^2)(1/3) = 12\pi$ cubic inches
One slice has 1/12th this volume, or $\boxed{\pi}$ cubic inches.

Note that $AB$ has length 5 and is parallel to the $x$-axis
Therefore, the height of the triangle is the difference in the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$, or $7-1 = 6$

The area of the rectangle is $9(7)=63$ square units, and the sum of the areas of the shaded triangles is $$\frac{1}{2}(6)(3)+\frac{1}{2}(3)(7)+\frac{1}{2}(4)(9)=37.5$$ square units
The area of the fourth triangle is $63-37.5=\boxed{25.5}$ square units.
Holding the rectangle vertically, we can form a cylinder with height 8 and base circumference of 5
Let this cylinder have volume $V_A$ and radius $r_A$; we have $2\pi r_A = 5$ so $r_A = \frac{5}{2\pi}$ and $V_A = \pi r_A ^2 h = \pi \left(\frac{5}{2\pi}\right)^2 (8) = \frac{50}{\pi}$.
Holding the rectangle horizontally, we can form a cylinder with height 5 and base circumference of 8
Similarly, let this cylinder have volume $V_B$ and radius $r_B$; we have $2\pi r_B = 8$ so $r_B = \frac{4}{\pi}$ and $V_B = \pi r_B^2 h = \pi \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^2 (5) = \frac{80}{\pi}$.
Hence, the ratio of the larger volume to the smaller volume is $\frac{80/\pi}{50/\pi}=\boxed{\frac{8}{5}}$.

Triangles $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ADC$ are both right and share hypotenuse $AC$, which has length $3$
Thus we have $$AB^2+BC^2 = AD^2+DC^2 = 3^2 = 9.$$The only possible integer values for $AB,$ $BC,$ $AD,$ or $DC$ are $1$ and $2$
Thus we may assume that one leg of $\triangle ABC$ has length $1$ and one leg of $\triangle ADC$ has length $2$ (it doesn't matter if the labels $B$ and $D$ have to be swapped to make this true).
If one leg of $\triangle ABC$ has length $1,$ then the other leg has length $\sqrt{3^2-1^2} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}$
If one leg of $\triangle ADC$ has length $2,$ then the other leg has length $\sqrt{3^2-2^2}= \sqrt{5}$
Thus, quadrilateral $ABCD$ is divided by its diagonal $AC$ into right triangles of area $\frac{1\cdot2\sqrt 2}{2}=\sqrt 2$ and $\frac{2\cdot\sqrt 5}{2}=\sqrt 5$
So, the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is $\boxed{\sqrt 2+\sqrt 5}$.
The water in the tank fills a cone, which we will refer to as the water cone, that is similar to the cone-shaped tank itself
Let the scale factor between the water cone and tank be $x$, so the height of the water cone is $96x$ feet and the radius of the water cone is $16x$ feet
It follows that the volume of the water cone is $(1/3)\pi(16x)^2(96x)$ cubic feet.
The volume of the cone-shaped tank is $(1/3)\pi(16^2)(96)$
Since the water cone has $25\%$ or 1/4 of the volume of the tank, we have  \[(1/3)\pi(16x)^2(96x) = (1/4) (1/3)\pi(16^2)(96).\]  Simplifying yields $x^3 = 1/4$, so $x = \sqrt[3]{1/4}$.
Finally, the height of the water in the tank is the height of the water cone, which is  \[96x=96\sqrt[3]{1/4}=48\cdot 2\sqrt[3]{1/4}=48\sqrt[3]{(1/4)(8)}={48\sqrt[3]{2}}\] feet
Therefore, we have $a+b=48+2 = \boxed{50}$.

We have $NP = PR/2 = 16$, so right triangle $PQN$ gives us \begin{align*}QN &= \sqrt{PQ^2 - PN^2} = \sqrt{34^2 - 16^2} \\
&= \sqrt{(34-16)(34+16)} = 30.\end{align*} (We might also have recognized that $PN/PQ = 8/17$, so $\allowbreak QN/PQ = 15/17$.)
Since $G$ is the centroid of $\triangle PQR$, we have $GN = \frac13(QN) = 10$, and right triangle $GNP$ gives us  \[GP = \sqrt{GN^2+NP^2} = \sqrt{100+256} = 2\sqrt{25 + 64} = 2\sqrt{89}.\] Finally, since $G$ is the centroid of $\triangle PQR$, we have $PM = \frac32(GP) = \boxed{3\sqrt{89}}$.
The smaller one has volume $\frac43\cdot27\pi=36\pi$ cubic units and the larger one $\frac43\cdot216\pi=288\pi$ cubic units
The volume between them is the difference of their volumes, or $288\pi-36\pi=\boxed{252\pi}$ cubic units.
Let the side length of the square be $x$
The triangle has $\frac{1}{2} x$ as both its base and height
Therefore, its area is $\frac{1}{8} x^2$, and since the area of the square is $x^2$, the shaded area is $\boxed{\frac{7}{8}}$ of the total.
Each small congruent right triangle in the diagram has the same area, which we will call $K$
Since $\triangle ABG$ consists of two small triangles, $[\triangle ABG]= 2K$
Similarly, $\triangle ACE$ is built from six small triangles, so $[\triangle ACE] = 6K$
Hence the ratio of these areas is $2K/6K = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
Looking at triangle $ABD$, we see that $\angle BAD = 180^\circ - \angle ABD - \angle ADB = 180^\circ - 40^\circ - 55^\circ = 85^\circ$
Then $\angle ABD < \angle ADB < \angle BAD$, so $AD < AB < BD$.
Looking at triangle $BCD$, we see that $\angle BCD = 180^\circ - \angle CBD - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 75^\circ - 55^\circ = 50^\circ$
Then $\angle BCD < \angle BDC < \angle CBD$, so $BD < BC < CD$.
Combining both inequalities, we see that \[AD < AB < BD < BC < CD.\]Therefore, the longest segment is $\boxed{CD}$.
We can see that $\angle ACB = 40^\circ$ must be half of the central angle formed by the arc ${AB},$ or $80^\circ.$ Likewise, $\angle CAD = 30^\circ$ must be half of the central angle formed by the arc ${CD},$ or $60^\circ.$ Then, we can see that the angles formed by arcs ${BC}$ and ${DA}$ must sum to $360^\circ - (80^\circ + 60^\circ) = 220^\circ.$ That means the sum $\angle CAB + \angle ACD$ must be half of that, or $\boxed{110^\circ}.$
Let $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $240^\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.

Triangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \frac{1}{2}$ and $DP = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(-\frac12,-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$, so $\cos 240^\circ = \boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}$.
Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the vertices of the triangle so that angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $C$ measures 30 degrees
Define $D$ to be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to side $AC$
Because angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $ADB$ is a right angle, triangle $ADB$ is a 45-45-90 triangle
Since the length of a leg of a 45-45-90 triangle is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ times the length of the hypotenuse, $AD=BD=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot 6\sqrt{2}=6$ units
Also, $CDB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so we can multiply the short leg $BD$ by 2 to find the length of the hypotenuse and by $\sqrt{3}$ to find the length of the longer leg
This gives $BC=12$ units and $CD=6\sqrt{3}$ units
The sum of the lengths of sides $AC$ and $BC$ is $6+6\sqrt{3}+12=18+6\sqrt{3}$
To the nearest tenth of a unit, this is $\boxed{28.4}$ units

We know the rectangular base of the pyramid has area $48$
To find the volume, we must also determine the height.

[/asy] Then by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \begin{align*}
13^2 &= OX^2+OA^2 = OX^2+OB^2 \\
&= OX^2+OC^2 = OX^2+OD^2.
\end{align*}Therefore, $OA=OB=OC=OD$, so $O$ must be the center of the rectangle (where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meet)
This is also the point where the diagonals of $ABCD$ bisect each other
Each diagonal of $ABCD$ has length $\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$, so we have $OA=OB=OC=OD=5$.
Thus $OX=\sqrt{13^2-OD^2} = \sqrt{13^2-5^2}=12$, and so the height of the pyramid is $12$
The volume is \begin{align*}
\frac 13\cdot (\text{area of base})\cdot (\text{height}) &= \frac 13\cdot 48\cdot 12 \\
&= 16\cdot 12 \\
&= \boxed{192}.
\end{align*}
We can begin by calculating the volume of the liquid in the glass
Since the glass is half full, the portion filled with liquid has height 3 inches
The volume will be $\pi r^2 h=\pi\cdot 1^2 \cdot 3 = 3\pi$
Now, since the ratio of lemon juice to water is 1:11, the ratio of lemon juice to the liquid will be 1:(1+11) which is 1:12
So, the volume of lemon juice in the glass is: $$3\pi \cdot \frac{1}{12}=\frac{\pi}{4}\approx .7854$$ So, the answer is $\boxed{.79}$ to the nearest hundredth.
Let $Q$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$

The semi-perimeter of the triangle is $(11 + 13 + 20)/2 = 22$, so by Heron's formula, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $$\sqrt{22(22 - 11)(22 - 13)(22 - 20)} = 66.$$Hence, the height of triangle $ABC$ with respect to base $BC$ is $AQ = 2 \cdot 66/BC = 2 \cdot 66/20 = 33/5$
Therefore, $GP = AQ/3 = (33/5)/3 = \boxed{\frac{11}{5}}$.
The areas of the regions enclosed by the square and the circle are $10^{2}=100$ and $\pi(10)^{2}= 100\pi$, respectively
One quarter of the second region is also included in the first, so the area of the union is \[
100+ 100\pi -25\pi= \boxed{100+75\pi}.
Call the point where the the runner touches the wall $C$
Reflect $B$ across the wall to $B'$
Since $CB=CB'$, minimizing $AC+CB$ is equivalent to minimizing $AC+CB'$
The wall is between $A$ and $B'$, so we may choose $C$ on line segment $AB'$
This choice minimizes $AC+CB'$, because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line
By the Pythagorean theorem, $AB'=\sqrt{1200^2+(300+500)^2}=400\sqrt{13}$ meters, which to the nearest meter is $\boxed{1442}$ meters.

$\triangle CFD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle with $CF=FD=\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2}$
So $GBFE$ is a square with side length $2+\sqrt{2}$, and $AG = BG = 2+\sqrt{2}$
It follows that $AE = AG + GE = 2(2+\sqrt{2}) = 4+2\sqrt{2}$, and finally $a+b = \boxed{6}$.
From $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle $CEB$, we have $BC=6\sqrt{3}$

The area of rectangle $ABCD$ is $$(BC)(CD)=\left(6\sqrt{3}\right)\left(18-2\sqrt{3}\right)=

First of all, the circumference of the entire circle is $36\pi.$ Since $\angle C = 70^\circ,$ we can see that the minor arc ${AB}$ has measure of twice that, or $140^\circ.$ Therefore, we can find its circumference by finding $36\pi \cdot \frac{140^\circ}{360^\circ} = \boxed{14\pi}.$
Since $\overline{RS}$ is vertical and $S$ lies on $\overline{BC}$ which is horizontal, $\triangle RSC$ has a right angle at $S$
$R$ lies on line segment $\overline{AC}$, which has slope $\frac{0-8}{8-0}=-1$
Since line $AC$ has a slope of $-1$, it makes an angle of $45^\circ$ with the $x$-axis, and the angle between lines $RC$ and $SC$ is $45^\circ$.
Since $\triangle RSC$ is right-angled at $S$ and has a $45^\circ$ angle at $C$, then the third-angle must be $180^\circ - 90^\circ - 45^\circ = 45^\circ$, which means that the triangle is right-angled and isosceles
Let $RS=SC=x$; then the area of $\triangle RSC$ is $\frac{1}{2}x^2$
But we know that this area is 12.5, so $\frac{1}{2}x^2 = 12.5 \Rightarrow x^2=25$
Since $x>0$, we have $x=5$.
Thus, $S$ is 5 units to the left of $C$ and has coordinates $(8-5,0)=(3,0)$
Point $R$ is 5 units above $S$ and has coordinates $(3,0+5)=(3,5)$
Finally, the desired difference is $5-3=\boxed{2}$.
Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$)
The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$
Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$
Thus, $EF$ has length $\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$
Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\text{Area} = a \left(\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases
The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \left(\frac{14+20}{2}\right)=6 \cdot 17 = \boxed{102}$ square units.
Let $a$ be the radius of the small circle, and let $b$ be the radius of the large circle
Then the area of the gray area is $\pi b^2 - \pi a^2,$ so
\[\pi b^2 - \pi a^2 = 3 (\pi a^2).\]Then $b^2 - a^2 = 3a^2,$ which simplifies to
\[b^2 = 4a^2.\]Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $b = 2a,$ so $\frac{a}{b} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
Since each column has a radius of 5 feet and height of 18 feet, the lateral surface area of each column is $2 \pi (5) \cdot 18 = 180 \pi$ square feet
Thus, the lateral surface area of 16 columns is $180\pi\cdot16\approx9043$ square feet
Since each gallon of paint covers 350 square feet, and since $9043/350\approx25.8$, we need $\boxed{26}$ gallons of paint.
Let $R$ and $S$ be the vertices of the smaller hexagon adjacent to vertex $E$ of the larger hexagon, and let $O$ be the center of the hexagons
Then, since $\angle ROS=60^\circ$, quadrilateral  $ORES$ encloses $1/6$ of the area of  $ABCDEF$, $\triangle ORS$  encloses $1/6$  of the area of the smaller hexagon, and $\triangle ORS$ is equilateral
Let $T$ be the center of $\triangle ORS$
Then triangles $TOR$, $TRS$, and $TSO$ are congruent isosceles  triangles with largest angle $120^\circ$
Triangle $ERS$ is an isosceles triangle with largest angle $120^\circ$ and a side in common with $\triangle TRS$, so $ORES$ is partitioned into four congruent triangles, exactly three of which form $\triangle ORS$
Since the ratio of the area enclosed by the small regular hexagon to the area of $ABCDEF$ is the same as the ratio of the area enclosed by $\triangle ORS$ to the area enclosed by $ORES$, the ratio is $\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$

Since the oil is $3$ feet deep, we want to find the ratio of the area of the part of the circle covered with oil (part under the horizontal line of the figure below) to the entire area of the circle.
draw(Circle((0,0),2));
draw((-1.732,1)--(1.732,1));
draw((0,0)--(-1.732,1));
draw((0,0)--(1.732,1));
draw((0,0)--(0,1));
[/asy] The two radii drawn makes a $120$ degree angle, so the area of the fraction of the circle covered by the oil is $\frac23$ of the circle in addition to the isosceles triangle
We can find the length of half the base of the isosceles triangle by using the Pythagorean theorem on the smaller right triangle
Setting half the length of the base to $x$, we have $x^2+1=4$, so $x=\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the base is $2\sqrt3$
Therefore, we have that the area of the triangle is $\frac12 \cdot 1 \cdot 2\sqrt3=\sqrt3$
So, the area of the part of the circle that's covered in oil is $\frac23 \cdot 4\pi + \sqrt3=\frac83\pi+\sqrt3$.
Thus, we have that the oil takes up $\dfrac{\frac83\pi+\sqrt3}{4\pi} \approx \frac{10.11}{12.57} \approx 0.805$ of the cylinder.
With the cylinder upright, the fraction of the cylinder the oil covers is the same as the fraction of the height the oil covers
Therefore, the oil would be $15 \text{ feet} \cdot 0.805 \approx 12.08 \approx \boxed{12.1}$.
Notice that after folding the paper, $\overline{CF}$ becomes $\overline{EF}$ (we are basically reflecting the segment across the crease line)
If $FD=x$, then $CF=EF=6-x$
Angle $FDE$ is a right angle since $ABCD$ is a square, so $\triangle FDE$ is a right triangle
We also know the length of $\overline{ED}$ is $3$ since $E$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AD}$
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $(6-x)^2=x^2+3^2$ and we can solve for $x$
\begin{align*}
(36-12x+x^2)&=x^2+9\quad\Rightarrow\\
36-12x&=9\quad\Rightarrow\\
27&=12x\quad\Rightarrow\\
\frac{9}{4}&=x
\end{align*} The length of $\overline{FD}$ is $\boxed{\frac94}$ cm.

We look at the lateral area of the cylinder as a rectangle (imagine a peeling the label off of a soup can and laying it flat)
The length of the rectangle is the circumference of the base, $12$ inches in this case, and the width of the rectangle is the height of the cylinder, $5$ inches
The spiral strip goes from one corner of the rectangular lateral area to the other, so it is also the hypotenuse of a right triangle
We find the length of the hypotenuse with the Pythagorean Theorem, or we recognize that $5$ and $12$ are part of the Pythagorean triple $(5, 12, 13)$, so the length of the hypotenuse (the spiral strip) is $\boxed{13}$ inches.

The amount of powdered sugar on a given donut hole is given by the surface area of the donut hole
The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\pi r^2$, so Niraek's donut holes each have surface area $4\pi \cdot 6^2 = 144\pi$ square millimeters
Similarly, Theo's donut holes each have surface area $4\pi \cdot 8^2 = 256\pi$ square millimeters and Akshaj's donut holes each have surface area $4\pi \cdot 10^2 = 400\pi$ square millimeters.
To determine the amount of powdered sugar used the first time all three workers finish at the same time, we compute the lowest common multiple of $144\pi$, $256\pi$, and $400\pi$
$144=2^4\cdot 3^2$, $256=2^8$, and $400=2^4\cdot 5^2$, so the desired LCM is $2^8\cdot 3^2\cdot 5^2\pi$
The number of donut holes Niraek will have covered by this point is $\frac{2^8\cdot 3^2\cdot 5^2\pi }{ 144\pi }= 2^4\cdot 5^2 = \boxed{400}$.

$\angle OTS$ and $\angle PST$ are right angles as tangents create right angles with radii at points of tangency
$RTSP$ is a rectangle, and $\triangle ORP$ is right
We use Pythagorean theorem on $\triangle ORP$:  we have $OP=8+2=10$ and $OR=8-2=6$, so $RP=\sqrt{OP^2-OR^2}=\sqrt{10^2-6^2}=8$
Then $TS=8$ as well.

A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\frac43\pi r^3$, so the volume of a hemisphere with radius $r$ is $\frac23\pi r^3$
Therefore if a hemisphere of radius $r$ has the same volume as a sphere of radius $R$, we get $\frac43\pi R^3=\frac23 \pi r^3$
Simplifying gives $R^3=\frac12 r^3\Rightarrow R=\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2}}r$
We know that $r=3\sqrt[3]{2}$ and that $R$ is the quantity we want to solve for, so substituting in our value of $r$ gives $R=\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2}}\cdot 3\sqrt[3]{2}=\boxed{3}.$

[/asy] Since the hexagon is regular, $\angle ABC = 120^\circ$ and $\angle ABH = \angle CBH = 120^\circ / 2 = 60^\circ$
Thus, $\triangle ABH$ and $\triangle CBH$ are congruent $30^\circ - 60^\circ - 90^\circ$ triangles
These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.
Since $AB=BC=10$, we have $BH = AB/2 = 5$ and $AH = CH = \sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \sqrt{75} = 5\sqrt{3}$
(Notice that this value is $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $BH$, the short leg
In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\circ - 60^\circ - 90^\circ$ is $1:\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $AC = 2\cdot 5\sqrt{3} = 10\sqrt{3}$.
The shaded region is a rectangle with base length $10$ and height length $10\sqrt{3}$; its area is $10\cdot 10\sqrt{3} = \boxed{100\sqrt{3}}$ square cm.
Since the exact dimensions of Bert's box do not matter, assume the box is $1 \times 2 \times 3$
Its volume is 6
Carrie's box is $2 \times 4 \times 6$, so its volume is 48 or 8 times the volume of Bert's box
Carrie has approximately $8(125) = \boxed{1000}$ jellybeans.
$\textbf{Note:}$ Other examples may help to see that the ratio is always 8 to 1.
Rotating the point $(1,0)$ about the origin by $270^\circ$ counterclockwise gives us the point $(0,-1)$, so $\sin 270^\circ = \boxed{-1}$.
The major diagonal has a length of $\sqrt{3}$
The volume of the pyramid is $1/6$, and so its height $h$ satisfies $\frac{1}{3}\cdot h\cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(\sqrt{2})^2=1/6$ since  the freshly cut face is an equilateral triangle of side length $\sqrt{2}$
Thus $h=\sqrt{3}/3$, and the answer is $\boxed{\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.
Let the cone have radius $r$ inches; we have $2\pi r = 16\pi$, so $r = 8$
Let the new height of the cone be $h$ inches
We have $192\pi = (1/3)\pi(8^2)(h)$; solving yields $h = 9$
Thus the ratio of the new height to the original height is $9/30 = \boxed{\frac{3}{10}}$.
To begin this problem, we first notice that the side length of this equilateral triangle is $8$ (the distance between the two points given)
We then consider the altitude of an equilateral triangle with side length $8$
If we draw an equilateral triangle and its altitude, we notice that the altitude splits the equilateral triangle into two $30-60-90$ triangles with the side length being the hypotenuse of these triangles
In our case, the hypotenuse of the $30-60-90$ triangle has length $8$, so the altitude (the side opposite the $60^\circ$ angle) has length $4\sqrt{3}$ because the side lengths of a $30-60-90$ triangle are related in the ratio $1:\sqrt{3}:2$.
Since the base of the equilateral triangle is at a $y$-coordinate of $5$ and $4\sqrt{3}>5$, for the third vertex to be in the first quadrant, its $y$ coordinate must be $5$ $+ $ the altitude of the equilateral triangle
The third vertex has a $y$-coordinate of $\boxed{5+4\sqrt{3}}$.

To find $\cos \angle PXS$, we build a right triangle with $\angle PXS$ as one of its acute angles
We do so by drawing altitude $\overline{SF}$ from $S$ to diagonal $\overline{PR}$ as shown
We then have $\cos \angle PXS = \cos\angle FXS = \frac{FX}{XS}$.
The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $PR = QS = 26$, so $XP=SX = QS/2 = 13$
We also have $\triangle FPS \sim \triangle SPR$ by AA Similarity (both are right triangles and $\angle SPR = \angle FPS$), so
\[\frac{FP}{PS} = \frac{SP}{PR}.\]This gives us
\[FP = PS \cdot \frac{SP}{PR} = \frac{10\cdot 10}{26} = \frac{50}{13}.\]Finally, we have $FX = XP - FP = 13 - \frac{50}{13} = \frac{119}{13}$, so \[\cos \angle PXS = \frac{FX}{XS} = \frac{119/13}{13} = \boxed{\frac{119}{169}}.\]
The formula for the area of a trapezoid is $\frac{1}{2}h\times(b_1+b_2)$, with $h$ being the height, $b_1$ being the shorter base, and $b_2$ being the longer base
We can find the height of this particular trapezoid with algebra: \begin{align*}
300&=\frac{1}{2}h\times(20+30)\\
600&=h\times50\\
\end{align*}Now that we know the height of the trapezoid, we can find the area of triangle $ADC$, whose base is $30$ (the longer base of the trapezoid), and whose height is $12$
Therefore, the area of triangle $ADC=\frac{1}{2}\cdot30\times12=180$
We can use this information to find that the area of triangle $ABC$, or the upper portion of the trapezoid, is $300-180=120$
Now we need to separate the area of $BXC$ from $AXB$, knowing that $ABC=120$
Because trapezoid $ABCD$ is not necessarily an isosceles trapezoid, nothing can be assumed about the diagonals, except that they will cut each other, and the height, in the same ratio as the bases, or $2:3$
The height of the trapezoid, $12$ units, is therefore divided into the heights of triangles $DXC$ and $AXB$
We can find these heights with the equation, letting $x$ be the height of triangle $DXC$: \begin{align*}
\frac{2}{3}\cdot x+x&=12\\
x\left(\frac{2}{3}+1\right)&=12\\
\frac{5}{3}x&=12\\
x&=7.2
\end{align*}So, the height of triangle $AXB$ is $\frac{2}{3}\times7.2=4.8$
We know that $AB$, the base of $AXB$, is $20$ units, so the area of $AXB=\frac{1}{2}(20)\times4.8=48$
Therefore, the area of triangle $BXC=120-48=\boxed{72}$ square units.
Since $AD$ is a median, $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, so $BD = CD = 4$
Let $P$ be the projection of $A$ onto $BC$
(Without loss of generality, we may assume that $P$ lies on $BD$.)  Let $x = BP$, so $PD = 4 - x$
Let $h = AP$.

Then by Pythagoras on right triangles $APB$, $APC$, and $APD$, \begin{align*}
AB^2 &= x^2 + h^2, \\
AC^2 &= (8 - x)^2 + h^2, \\
25 &= (4 - x)^2 + h^2.
\end{align*}Adding the first two equations, we get \[AB^2 + AC^2 = x^2 + h^2 + (8 - x)^2 + h^2 = 2x^2 - 16x + 64 + 2h^2.\]But from the third equation, $25 = x^2 - 8x + 16 + h^2$, so \begin{align*}
AB^2 + AC^2 &= 2x^2 - 16x + 64 + 2h^2 \\
&= 2(x^2 - 8x + 16 + h^2) + 32 \\
&= 2 \cdot 25 + 32 \\
&= 82.
\end{align*}Hence, from the given data, $AB^2 + AC^2$ can only take on the value 82
Therefore, $M = m = 82$, so $M - m = \boxed{0}$.
At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position
The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\frac{2}{3}(360^\circ)=240$ degrees
Every minute, the minute hand goes $\frac{1}{60}(360^\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\frac{1}{60}\cdot\frac{1}{12} (360^\circ)=0.5$ degrees
Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute
After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\circ-5.5^\circ\cdot 15=\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.
From our similarity, we have that: \begin{align*}
\frac{DE}{AC} &= \frac{BE}{BC} \\
DE &= \frac{BE \cdot AC}{BC}\\

The crosswalk is in the shape of a parallelogram with base 15 feet and altitude 40 feet, so its area is $15 \times 40 = 600\; \text{ft}^2$
But viewed another way, the parallelogram has base 50 feet and altitude equal to the distance between the stripes, so this distance must be $600/50=\boxed{12}$ feet.

We label the points as shown
$A$ is the midpoint of the top side of the square, and $B$ is a vertex of the square
We look at right triangle $\triangle OAB$
We seek a ratio of areas, which remains constant no matter the side lengths, so for simplicity, we let the big square have side length $2$ and the small square have side length $2x$
Then, $OA=1+2x$, $AB=x$, and $OB$ is a radius of the circle, which has length $\sqrt{2}$ by 45-45-90 triangles
Then, the Pythagorean theorem states that $OA^2+AB^2=OB^2$, or \[(1+2x)^2 + x^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2.\]   Simplifying the equation yields \begin{align*}
& 1+4x+4x^2 + x^2 = 2 \\
\Longleftrightarrow\ & 5x^2 + 4x-1 =0 \\
\Longleftrightarrow\ & (5x-1)(x+1).
\end{align*} Thus, $x=-1$ or $x=1/5$
Lengths are clearly positive, so the valid solution is $x=1/5$
Then the small square has side length $2x=2/5$, and area $(2/5)^2 = 4/25$
The large square has area $2^2=4$, so the small square has \[\frac{4/25}{4}=1/25=\boxed{4\%}\] the area of the large square.
Construct the right triangle $\bigtriangleup AOB$ as shown in the figure
Since $AB=2$, we have $AO=\sqrt{2}$ and $AD=2+2\sqrt{2}$
Similarly, we have $OG=2+\sqrt{2}$, so \begin{align*}
\text{Area}(\bigtriangleup ADG)&=\frac{1}{2}(2+2\sqrt{2})(2+\sqrt{2})\\&=(1+\sqrt{2})(2+\sqrt{2})=\boxed{4+3\sqrt{2}}.

If $r$ is the radius of the circle, we know that $x = \pi r^2$ and $y = 2\pi r$
Thus, we have \begin{align*}
x + y &= 80\pi\\
\pi r^2 + 2\pi r &= 80\pi\\
r(r + 2) &= 80.
\end{align*}
We want to find two integers whose product is 80, such that one integer is two more than the other
We note that 80 can be factored as $8\cdot 10$
Therefore, $r = \boxed{8}$.
More generally, suppose $(a_i),$ $(b_i),$ $(c_i)$ represent the entries in rows $n - 1,$ $n,$ $n + 1$ of Pascal's triangle
\[a_i = \binom{n - 1}{i}, \ b_i = \binom{n}{i}, \ c_i = \binom{n + 1}{i},\]so
\begin{align*}
\frac{a_i}{b_i} &= \frac{\binom{n - 1}{i}}{\binom{n}{i}} \\
&= \frac{\frac{(n - 1)!}{i! (n - i - 1)!}}{\frac{n!}{i! (n - i)!}} \\
&= \frac{(n - 1)! (n - i)!}{n! (n - i - 1)!} \\
&= \frac{n - i}{n} \\
&= 1 - \frac{i}{n}.
\end{align*}Hence,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} \frac{a_i}{b_i} &= \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} \left( 1 - \frac{i}{n} \right) \\
&= n - \frac{(n - 1)n/2}{n} \\
&= n - \frac{n - 1}{2} = \frac{n + 1}{2}.
\end{align*}Likewise,
\[\frac{b_i}{c_i} = 1 - \frac{i}{n + 1},\]and
\[\sum_{i = 0}^n \frac{b_i}{c_i} = \frac{n + 2}{2}.\]Hence,
\[\sum_{i = 0}^n \frac{b_i}{c_i} - \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} \frac{a_i}{b_i} = \frac{n + 2}{2} - \frac{n + 1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.\]
We complete the square with respect to the terms $b^2$ and $\frac{b}{a},$ to get
\[b^2 + \frac{b}{a} = \left( b + \frac{1}{2a} \right)^2 - \frac{1}{4a^2}.\]This is minimized when $b = -\frac{1}{2a}.$  The problem now is to minimize
\[a^2 + \frac{1}{a^2} - \frac{1}{4a^2} = a^2 + \frac{3}{4a^2}.\]We can assume that $a$ is positive
Then by AM-GM,
\[a^2 + \frac{3}{4a^2} \ge 2 \sqrt{a^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4a^2}} = \sqrt{3}.\]Equality occurs when $a = \sqrt[4]{\frac{3}{4}},$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{\sqrt{3}}.$
Let $a_1 = a$ and $a_2 = b.$  Then
\begin{align*}
a_3 &= a + b, \\
a_4 &= a + 2b, \\
a_5 &= 2a + 3b, \\
a_6 &= 3a + 5b, \\
a_7 &= 5a + 8b, \\
a_8 &= 8a + 13b.
\end{align*}Hence, $5a + 8b = 120.$  Then $5a = 120 - 8b = 8(15 - b).$  Since 5 is relatively prime to 8, $a$ is divisible by 8.
If $a = 8,$ then $b = 10.$  If $a = 16,$ then $b = 5,$ which does not work, because the sequence is increasing, so $b > a.$  Note that higher values of $b$ return lower values of $a,$ so the only possible value of $a$ is 8
Then $b = 10,$ so $a_8 = 8a + 13b = \boxed{194}.$
In the coordinate plane, let $A = (0,1),$ $B = (1,-1),$ and $P = (x,x).$  Then
\[AP = \sqrt{x^2 + (1 - x)^2}\]and
\[BP = \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (x + 1)^2},\]so we want to minimize $AP + BP,$ subject to $P$ lying on the line $y = x.$

By the Triangle Inequality, $AP + BP \ge AB = \sqrt{5}.$  Equality occurs when $P$ is the intersection of the line $y = x$ and line $AB$ (which occurs when $x = \frac{1}{3}$), so the minimum value is $\boxed{\sqrt{5}}.$
We can write the equation as
\[(x + \sqrt{2})^3 + (x + \sqrt{2}) = 0.\]Then
\[(x + \sqrt{2})[(x + \sqrt{2})^2 + 1] = 0,\]so $x = -\sqrt{2}$ or $(x + \sqrt{2})^2 = -1.$  For the latter equation,
\[x + \sqrt{2} = \pm i,\]so $x = -\sqrt{2} \pm i.$
Thus, the solutions are $\boxed{-\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2} + i, -\sqrt{2} - i}.$
We rewrite the given recursion as \[a_ka_{k+1} = a_{k-1}a_k - 3.\]This implies that the numbers $a_0a_1, a_1a_2, a_2a_3, \ldots$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $-3$
We have $a_0a_1 = 37 \cdot 72$ and $a_{m-1}a_m = 0$ (because $a_m = 0$)
Since those two terms are $m-1$ terms apart, we have \[a_{m-1}a_m - a_0a_1 = 0 - 37 \cdot 72 = -3 (m-1),\]so \[m = 37 \cdot 24 + 1 = \boxed{889}.\]
By AM-GM,
\[x + 2y + 4z \ge 3 \sqrt[3]{(x)(2y)(4z)} = 3 \sqrt[3]{8xyz} = 3 \sqrt[3]{8 \cdot 8} = 12.\]Equality occurs when $x = 2y = 4z$ and $xyz = 8.$  We can solve to get $x = 4,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{12}.$
By QM-AM,
\[\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}} \ge \frac{a + b}{2} = \frac{t}{2}.\]Then
\[\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \ge \frac{t^2}{4},\]so $a^2 + b^2 \ge \frac{t^2}{2}.$
Equality occurs when $a = b = \frac{t}{2},$ so the minimum value of $a^2 + b^2$ is $\boxed{\frac{t^2}{2}}.$
Since the coefficients of the polynomial are all real, another is the conjugate of $1 - 2i,$ namely $1 + 2i.$  Let $r$ be the third root
Then the polynomial is
\[(x - 1 + 2i)(x - 1 - 2i)(x - r) = x^3 - (r + 2)x^2 + (2r + 5)x - 5r.\]Then $2r + 5 = -1,$ so $r = -3.$  Then $a = -(r + 2) = 1$ and $b = -5r = 15,$ so $(a,b) = \boxed{(1,15)}.$
Since $x^2 + 2x + 7 = (x + 1)^2 + 6 > 0$ for all $x,$ the sign of $\frac{x + 6}{x^2 + 2x + 7}$ is the same as the sign of $x + 6.$  Thus, the solution is $x \in \boxed{[-6,\infty)}.$
First, we take out a factor of $a - b$:
\begin{align*}
a^3 (b^2 - c^2) + b^3 (c^2 - a^2) + c^3 (a^2 - b^2) &= a^3 b^2 - a^2 b^3 + b^3 c^2 - a^3 c^2 + c^3 (a + b)(a - b) \\
&= a^2 b^2 (a - b) + (b^3 - a^3) c^2 + c^3 (a + b)(a - b) \\
&= (a - b)[a^2 b^2 - (a^2 + ab + b^2) c^2 + c^3 (a + b)] \\
&= (a - b)(a^2 b^2 - a^2 c^2 - abc^2 - b^2 c^2 + ac^3 + bc^3).
\end{align*}We can then take out a factor of $b - c$:
\begin{align*}
a^2 b^2 - a^2 c^2 - abc^2 - b^2 c^2 + ac^3 + bc^3 &= a^2 (b^2 - c^2) + ac^3 - abc^2 + bc^3 - b^2 c^2 \\
&= a^2 (b^2 - c^2) + ac^2 (c - b) + bc^2 (c - b) \\
&= a^2 (b - c)(b + c) + ac^2 (c - b) + bc^2 (c - b) \\
&= (b - c)[a^2 (b + c) - ac^2 - bc^2] \\
&= (b - c)(a^2 b + a^2 c - ac^2 - bc^2).
\end{align*}Finally, we take out a factor of $c - a$:
\begin{align*}
a^2 b + a^2 c - ac^2 - bc^2 &= a^2 b - bc^2 + a^2 c - ac^2 \\
&= b (a^2 - c^2) + ac(a - c) \\
&= b (a - c)(a + c) + ac(a - c) \\
&= -(c - a)(ab + ac + bc).
\end{align*}Thus, $p(a,b,c) = \boxed{-(ab + ac + bc)}.$
Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get
\[(x - 3)^2 - 4(y + 1)^2 = 32.\]Then
\[\frac{(x - 3)^2}{32} - \frac{(y + 1)^2}{8} = 1.\]We see that $a^2 = 32$ and $b^2 = 8,$ so $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 40,$ and $c = 2 \sqrt{10}.$  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \boxed{4 \sqrt{10}}.$
We notice that the numerator and denominator share common factors: $x^2+x^3-2x^4 = x^2(1+x-2x^2)$ and $x+x^2-2x^3=x(1+x-2x^2).$ Hence, whenever $x(1+x-2x^2) \neq 0,$ we can write \[\frac{x^2+x^3-2x^4}{x+x^2-2x^3} = \frac{x^2(1+x-2x^2)}{x(1+x-2x^2)} = x.\]It follows that the given inequality is satisfied if and only if $x \ge -1$ and $x(1+x-2x^2) \neq 0.$ The roots of $1+x-2x^2$ are $x=1$ and $x=-\frac12,$ so we cannot have $x=0,$ $x=1,$ or $x=-\tfrac12.$ Putting all this together, the solution set of the inequality consists of the interval $[-1, \infty)$ with three "holes": \[x \in \boxed{[-1, -\tfrac12) \cup (-\tfrac12, 0) \cup (0, 1) \cup (1, \infty)}.\]
By AM-GM,
\[\frac{a + b + c}{3} \ge \sqrt[3]{abc} = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4.\]Since $a,$ $b,$ $c$ form an arithmetic series, $\frac{a + b + c}{3} = b,$ so $b \ge 4.$
Equality occurs when $a = b = c = 4,$ so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\boxed{4}.$
We have $|7-24i| = \sqrt{7^2 + (-24)^2} = \boxed{25}$.
We can write
\[\frac{x^2 + 7}{\sqrt{x^2 + 3}} = \frac{x^2 + 3 + 4}{\sqrt{x^2 + 3}} = \frac{x^2 + 3}{\sqrt{x^2 + 3}} + \frac{4}{\sqrt{x^2 + 3}} = \sqrt{x^2 + 3} + \frac{4}{\sqrt{x^2 + 3}}.\]By AM-GM,
\[\sqrt{x^2 + 3} + \frac{4}{\sqrt{x^2 + 3}} \ge 2 \sqrt{\sqrt{x^2 + 3} \cdot \frac{4}{\sqrt{x^2 + 3}}} = 4.\]Equality occurs when $x = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{4}.$
First of all, we know that $|ab|=|a|\cdot |b|$, so \[\left|\left(3 + \sqrt{7}i\right)^3\right|=\left|3 + \sqrt{7} i\right|^3\]We also find that \[\left|3 +\sqrt{7}i\right|=\sqrt{\left(3\right)^2+\left(\sqrt{7}\right)^2}=\sqrt{16}=4\]Therefore, our answer is $4^3=\boxed{64}$.
First, note that
\begin{align*}
f(x,y,z) &= \frac{x}{x + y} + \frac{y}{y + z} + \frac{z}{z + x} \\
&> \frac{x}{x + y + z} + \frac{y}{y + z + x} + \frac{z}{z + x + y} \\
&= \frac{x + y + z}{x + y + z} = 1.
\end{align*}Let $\epsilon$ be a small positive number
\begin{align*}
f(\epsilon^2,\epsilon,1) &= \frac{\epsilon^2}{\epsilon^2 + \epsilon} + \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon + 1} + \frac{1}{1 + \epsilon^2} \\
&= \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon + 1} + \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon + 1} + \frac{1}{1 + \epsilon^2}.
\end{align*}As $\epsilon$ approaches 0, $f(\epsilon^2,\epsilon,1)$ approaches 1
This means we can make $f(x,y,z)$ arbitrarily close to 1, without actually reaching 1.
Now, note that
\[f(x,y,z) + f(x,z,y) = \frac{x}{x + y} + \frac{y}{y + z} + \frac{z}{z + x} + \frac{x}{x + z} + \frac{z}{z + y} + \frac{y}{x + y} = 3.\]Therefore, $f(x,y,z) < 2,$ and we can make $f(x,y,z)$ arbitrarily close to 2.
Hence, the set of all possible values of $f(x,y,z)$ is $\boxed{(1,2)}.$
Adding $4$ to both sides, we have
\[\left(1+\dfrac{3}{x-3}\right) + \left(1+\dfrac{5}{x-5}\right) +\left(1+ \dfrac{17}{x-17} \right)+ \left(1+\dfrac{19}{x-19}\right) = x^2 - 11x \]or \[\frac{x}{x-3} + \frac{x}{x-5} + \frac{x}{x-17}+ \frac{x}{x-19} = x^2-11x.\]Either $x=0$, or \[\frac{1}{x-3} + \frac{1}{x-5} + \frac{1}{x-17} + \frac{1}{x-19} = x-11.\]To induce some symmetry, we calculate that the average of the numbers $x-3, x-5, x-17, x-19$ is $x-11$
Then, letting $t = x-11$, we have \[\frac{1}{t+8} + \frac{1}{t+6} + \frac{1}{t-6} + \frac{1}{t-8} = t,\]or, combining the first and last terms and the second and third terms, \[\frac{2t}{t^2-64} + \frac{2t}{t^2-36} = t.\]Either $t=0$, or we can divide by $t$ and cross-multiply, giving \[2(t^2-36) + 2(t^2-64) = (t^2-36)(t^2-64) \implies 0 = t^4 - 104t^2 + 2504.\]Completing the square, we get $(t^2-52)^2 = 200$, so $t^2 = 52 \pm \sqrt{200}$, and $t = \pm \sqrt{52 \pm \sqrt{200}}$
Undoing the substitution $t = x-11$, we have \[x = 11 \pm \sqrt{52 \pm \sqrt{200}}.\]Therefore, the largest root is $x = 11+\sqrt{52+\sqrt{200}}$ (which is larger than both $x=0$ and $t=0 \implies x=11$), and the answer is $11 + 52 + 200 = \boxed{263}$.
We can solve for $y,$ to get
\[y = \frac{4 - x - z}{2}.\]Substituting, we get
\[xy + xz + yz = \frac{-x^2 + 4x - z^2 + 4z}{2} = \frac{8 - (x - 2)^2 - (z - 2)^2}{2}.\]The maximum value is then $\boxed{4},$ which occurs when $x = 2$ and $z = 2$ (and $y = 0$).
First, we decompose $\frac{4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1}{n^6 - n^5 + n^4 - n^3 + n^2 - n}$ into partial fractions
We factor the denominator:
\begin{align*}
n^6 - n^5 + n^4 - n^3 + n^2 - n &= n(n^5 - n^4 + n^3 - n^2 + n - 1) \\
&= n(n^4 (n - 1) + n^2 (n - 1) + (n - 1)) \\
&= n(n - 1)(n^4 + n^2 + 1) \\
&= n(n - 1)[(n^4 + 2n^2 + 1) - n^2] \\
&= n(n - 1)[(n^2 + 1)^2 - n^2] \\
&= n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1).
\end{align*}Then by partial fractions,
\[\frac{4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1}{n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)} = \frac{A}{n} + \frac{B}{n - 1} + \frac{Cn + D}{n^2 + n + 1} + \frac{En + F}{n^2 - n + 1}\]for some constants $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F.$
Multiplying both sides by $n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1),$ we get
\begin{align*}
4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1 &= A(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\
&\quad + Bn(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\
&\quad + (Cn + D)n(n - 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\
&\quad + (En + F)n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1).
\end{align*}Setting $n = 0,$ we get $-A = 1,$ so $A = -1.$
Setting $n = 1,$ we get $3B = 3,$ so $B = 1.$  The equation above then becomes
\begin{align*}
4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1 &= -(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\
&\quad + n(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\
&\quad + (Cn + D)n(n - 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\
&\quad + (En + F)n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1).
\end{align*}This simplifies to
\[n^4 + 4n^3 - 2n^2 - n = (Cn + D)n(n - 1)(n^2 - n + 1) + (En + F)n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1).\]Dividing both sides by $n(n - 1),$ we get
\[-n^2 + 3n + 1 = (Cn + D)(n^2 - n + 1) + (En + F)(n^2 + n + 1).\]Expanding, we get
\[-n^2 + 3n + 1 = (C + E)n^3 + (C + D + E + F)n^2 + (C - D + E + F)n + D + F.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
C + E &= 0, \\
-C + D + E + F &= -1, \\
C - D + E + F &= 3, \\
D + F &= 1.
\end{align*}Since $C + E = 0,$ $-D + F = 3.$  Hence, $D = -1$ and $F = 2.$  Then $-C + E = -2,$ so $C = 1$ and $E = -1.$  Therefore,
\[\frac{4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1}{n^6 - n^5 + n^4 - n^3 + n^2 - n} = \frac{1}{n - 1} - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{n - 1}{n^2 + n + 1} - \frac{n - 2}{n^2 - n + 1}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1}{n^6 - n^5 + n^4 - n^3 + n^2 - n} &= \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{7} \right) \\
&\quad + \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{13} - \frac{1}{7} \right) \\
&\quad + \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{21} - \frac{2}{13} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
We can assume that the ellipse is tangent to the circle $(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1.$  From this equation, $y^2 = 1 - (x - 1)^2.$  Substituting into the equation of the ellipse, we get
\[\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{1 - (x - 1)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]This simplifies to
\[(a^2 - b^2) x^2 - 2a^2 x + a^2 b^2 = 0.\]By symmetry, the $x$-coordinates of both tangent points will be equal, so the discriminant of this quadratic will be 0:
\[(2a^2)^2 - 4(a^2 - b^2)(a^2 b^2) = 0.\]This simplifies to $a^4 b^2 = a^4 + a^2 b^4.$  We can divide both sides by $a^2$ to get
\[a^2 b^2 = a^2 + b^4.\]Then
\[a^2 = \frac{b^4}{b^2 - 1}.\]The area of the ellipse is $\pi ab.$  Minimizing this is equivalent to minimizing $ab,$ which in turn is equivalent to minimizing
\[a^2 b^2 = \frac{b^6}{b^2 - 1}.\]Let $t = b^2,$ so
\[\frac{b^6}{b^2 - 1} = \frac{t^3}{t - 1}.\]Then let $u = t - 1.$  Then $t = u + 1,$ so
\[\frac{t^3}{t - 1} = \frac{(u + 1)^3}{u} = u^2 + 3u + 3 + \frac{1}{u}.\]By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
u^2 + 3u + \frac{1}{u} &= u^2 + \frac{u}{2} + \frac{u}{2} + \frac{u}{2} + \frac{u}{2} + \frac{u}{2} + \frac{u}{2} + \frac{1}{8u} + \frac{1}{8u} + \frac{1}{8u} + \frac{1}{8u} + \frac{1}{8u} + \frac{1}{8u} + \frac{1}{8u} + \frac{1}{8u} \\
&\ge 15 \sqrt{u^2 \cdot \frac{u^6}{2^6} \cdot \frac{1}{8^8 u^8}} = \frac{15}{4}.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $u = \frac{1}{2}.$  For this value of $u,$ $t = \frac{3}{2},$ $b = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2},$ and $a = \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}.$  Hence,
\[k = ab = \boxed{\frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{2}}.\]
Polynomial long division gives us
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{x} & +2 \\
\cline{2-4}
2x+3 & 2x^2&+7x&+10 \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{2x^2} & +3x &   \\
\cline{2-3}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{0} & 4x &  +10 \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 4x &  +6 \\
\cline{3-4}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 0 &  4 \\
\end{array}
\]Hence, we can write
$$\frac{2x^2+7x+10}{2x+3} = x + 2 + \frac{4}{2x+3}.$$So we can see that as $x$ becomes far from $0$, the graph of the function gets closer and closer to the line $\boxed{y = x+2}.$
Note that the sum of the elements in the set is 8
Let $x=a+b+c+d$, so $e+f+g+h=8-x$
\begin{align*}
(a+b+c+d)^{2} &+ (e+f+g+h)^{2} = x^{2} + (8-x)^{2}\\
&= 2x^{2} - 16x + 64
= 2(x-4)^{2} + 32
\geq 32.
\end{align*}The value of 32 can be attained if and only if $x=4$
However, it may be assumed without loss of generality that $a=13$, and no choice of $b,c$, and $d$ gives a total of 4 for $x$
Thus $(x - 4)^2 \ge 1$, and \[
(a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2 = 2(x-4)^2 + 32 \geq \boxed{34}.
\]A total of 34 can be attained by letting $a,b,c$, and $d$ be distinct elements in the set $\{-7,-5,2,13\}$.
There is exactly one term in the simplified expression for every monomial of the form $x^ay^bz^c$, where $a,b$, and $c$ are non-negative integers, $a$ is even, and $a+b+c=2006$
There are 1004 even values of $a$ with $0\leq a\leq 2006$
For each such value, $b$ can assume any of the $2007-a$ integer values between 0 and $2006-a$, inclusive, and the value of $c$ is then uniquely determined as $2006-a-b$
Thus the number of terms in the simplified expression is \[
(2007-0)+(2007-2)+\cdots +(2007-2006)=2007+2005+\cdots +1.
\]This is the sum of the first 1004 odd positive integers, which is $
1004^2=\boxed{1{,}008{,}016}.
\[ OR \]The given expression is equal to \[
\sum \frac{2006!}{a!b!c!}
\left(x^ay^bz^c + x^a(-y)^b(-z)^c \right),
\]where the sum is taken over all non-negative integers $a,b,$ and $c$ with $a+b+c=2006$
Because the number of non-negative integer solutions of $a+b+c=k$ is $\binom{k+2}{2}$, the sum is taken over $\binom{2008}{2}$ terms, but those for which $b$ and $c$ have opposite parity have a sum of zero
If $b$ is odd and $c$ is even, then $a$ is odd, so $a=2A+1,b=2B+1,
\text{ and }c=2C$ for some non-negative integers $A,B,\text{ and }C$
Therefore $2A+1+2B+1+2C=2006$, so $A+B+C=1002$
Because the last equation has $\binom{1004}{2}$ non-negative integer solutions, there are $\binom{1004}{2}$ terms for which $b$ is odd and $c$ is even
The number of terms for which $b$ is even and $c$ is odd is the same
Thus the number of terms in the simplified expression is \[\binom{2008}{2}-2\binom{1004}{2} = 1004\cdot 2007 - 1004\cdot 1003 =
1004^2 = \boxed{1{,}008{,}016}.\]
From $z^{24} = 1,$ $z^{24} - 1 = 0,$ so
\[(z^{12} + 1)(z^{12} - 1) = 0.\]Then
\[(z^{12} + 1)(z^6 + 1)(z^6 - 1) = 0.\]Thus, for 6 of the roots, $z^6 = -1,$ for another 6 of the roots, $z^6 = 1,$ and for the remaining 12 roots, $(z^6)^2 + 1 = 0,$ so $z^6$ is not real
Therefore, for $\boxed{12}$ of the roots, $z^6$ is real.
The conditions on $f$ imply that both \[
x = f(x) + f\displaystyle\left(\frac{1}{x}\displaystyle\right)\]and \[\frac{1}{x} = f\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) +
f\displaystyle\left(\frac{1}{1/x}\displaystyle\right) = f\displaystyle\left(\frac{1}{x}\displaystyle\right) + f(x).
\]Thus if $x$ is in the domain of $f$, then $x = 1/x$, so $x = \pm 1$.
The conditions are satisfied if and only if $f(1)=1/2$ and $f(-1)=-1/2$
Hence the answer is $\boxed{E}$.
Fix $s \in S.$  Setting $y = s - x,$ we get
\[f(x) + f(s - x) = f(x(s - x)f(s))
\quad (*)\]This holds for all $x \in S,$ $x \neq s.$
Consider the equation
\[s - x = x(s - x) f(s).\]The solutions in $x$ are $x = s$ and $x = \frac{1}{f(s)}.$  Since $x \in S,$ $f(s)$ is well-defined
Furthermore, $f(s) \neq 0,$ so $\frac{1}{f(s)}$ is well-defined
If $f(s) \neq \frac{1}{s},$ then we can set $x = \frac{1}{f(s)}$ in $(*),$ which gives us
\[f \left( \frac{1}{f(s)} \right) + f \left( s - \frac{1}{f(s)} \right) = f \left( s - \frac{1}{f(s)} \right).\]Then $f \left( \frac{1}{f(s)} \right) = 0,$ contradiction.
The only possibility then is that $f(s) = \frac{1}{s}.$  In other words,
\[f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\]for all $x \in S.$
We can check that $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ works, so $n = 1$ and $s = \frac{1}{4},$ so $n \times s = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}.$
Since $|\beta| = 1,$ $|\overline{\beta}| = 1,$ so
\begin{align*}
\left| \frac{\beta - \alpha}{1 - \overline{\alpha} \beta} \right| &= \frac{1}{|\overline{\beta}|} \cdot \left| \frac{\beta - \alpha}{1 - \overline{\alpha} \beta} \right| \\
&= \left| \frac{\beta - \alpha}{\overline{\beta} - \overline{\alpha} \beta \overline{\beta}} \right| \\
&= \left| \frac{\beta - \alpha}{\overline{\beta} - \overline{\alpha} |\beta|^2} \right| \\
&= \left| \frac{\beta - \alpha}{\overline{\beta} - \overline{\alpha}} \right| \\
&= \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
To try and write the given equation in standard form, we complete the square in each variable: \[\begin{aligned} (x^2-10x) + 4(y^2+14y) &= k \\ (x^2-10x+25) + 4(y^2+14y+49) &= k + 25 + 4(49) = k + 221 \\ (x-5)^2 + 4(y+7)^2 &= k + 221
\end{aligned}\]We see that if $k + 221 > 0,$ then we can divide both sides by $k + 221$ to obtain the standard form for the equation of an ellipse
On the other hand, if $k + 221 = 0,$ then this equation is only satisfied when $x-5 = 0$ and $y+7=0,$ so the graph of the equation only consists of a single point
And if $k + 221 < 0,$ then no points $(x, y)$ satisfy this equation
Therefore, the graph is a non-degenerate ellipse if and only if $k + 221 > 0,$ that is, $k > -221.$ Thus, $a = \boxed{-221}.$
Each pair of adjacent terms sums to 1 and there are $10,\!000$ terms, so the sum is $10,\!000/2=\boxed{5000}$.
We have \[29 \le x \lfloor x \rfloor < 30.\]First, suppose that $x \ge 0.$ Then we have $x \lfloor x \rfloor \ge \lfloor x \rfloor^2,$ so $\lfloor x \rfloor^2 < 30,$ and $\lfloor x \rfloor \le 5.$ Also, $x\lfloor x \rfloor \le x^2,$ so $29 \le x^2,$ which means that $\lfloor x \rfloor \ge 5.$ Thus, $\lfloor x \rfloor = 5,$ so $\lfloor 5x \rfloor = 29$ from the original equation
Thus, $29 \le 5x < 30,$ so \[5.8 \le x < 6.\]Indeed, if $5.8 \le x < 6,$ then $\lfloor x \lfloor x \rfloor \rfloor = \lfloor 5x \rfloor = 29,$ so all $x \in [5.8,6)$ are solutions to the equation.
Now suppose that $x < 0.$ Then we have $x\lfloor x \rfloor \le \lfloor x \rfloor^2,$ so $29 \le \lfloor x \rfloor^2,$ and $\lfloor x \rfloor \le -6.$ But then $x < -5,$ so \[x \lfloor x \rfloor \ge -6x > -6(-5) = 30,\]a contradiction
Hence, no negative $x$ satisfy the equation.
Thus, the solution set is the interval $\boxed{[5.8,6)}.$
We have that
\[f(f(f(-x))) = f(f(-f(x)) = f(-f(f(x))) = -f(f(f(x))),\]so $f(f(f(x)))$ is an $\boxed{\text{odd}}$ function.
We have that
\[(x^2 - x + a) p(x) = x^{13} + x + 90\]for some polynomial $p(x)$ with integer coefficients.
Setting $x = 0,$ we get $ap(0) = 90.$  This means $a$ divides 90.
Setting $x = 1,$ we get $ap(1) = 92.$  This means $a$ divides 92.
Since $a$ divides both 90 and 92, it must divide $92 - 90 = 2.$  Hence, $a$ must be equal to 2, 1, $-1,$ or $-2.$
Setting $x = -1,$ we get $(a + 2) p(-1) = 88.$  This means $a + 2$ divides 88
Of the four values we listed above, only $a = -1$ and $a = 2$ work.
If $a = -1,$ then $x^2 - x + a$ becomes $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$
The roots are
\[x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]In particular, one root is positive, and one root is negative
But $x^{13} + x + 90$ is positive for all positive $x,$ which means that it does not have any positive roots
Therefore, $a$ cannot be $-1,$ which means $a = \boxed{2}.$
By Long Division,
\[x^{13} + x + 90 = (x^2 - x + 2)(x^{11} + x^{10} - x^9 - 3x^8 - x^7 + 5x^6 + 7x^5 - 3x^4 - 17x^3 - 11x^2 + 23x + 45).\]
First, we split $\frac{2n - 1}{n(n + 1)(n + 2)}$ into partial fractions by writing
\[\frac{2n - 1}{n(n + 1)(n + 2)} = \frac{A}{n} + \frac{B}{n + 1} + \frac{C}{n + 2}.\]Then $2n - 1 = A(n + 1)(n + 2) + Bn(n + 2) + Cn(n + 1).$
Setting $n = 0,$ we get $-1 = 2A,$ so $A = -\frac{1}{2}.$
Setting $n = -1,$ we get $-3 = -B,$ so $B = 3.$
Setting $n = -2,$ we get $2C = -5,$ so $C = -\frac{5}{2}.$  Thus,
\[\frac{2n - 1}{n(n + 1)(n + 2)} = -\frac{1/2}{n} + \frac{3}{n + 1} - \frac{5/2}{n + 2}.\]Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{2n - 1}{n(n + 1)(n + 2)} &= \left( -\frac{1/2}{1} + \frac{3}{2} - \frac{5/2}{3} \right) + \left( -\frac{1/2}{2} + \frac{3}{3} - \frac{5/2}{4} \right) \\
&\quad + \left( -\frac{1/2}{3} + \frac{3}{4} - \frac{5/2}{5} \right) + \left( -\frac{1/2}{4} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{5/2}{6} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{5/2}{2} = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.
\end{align*}
We can rewrite the summand as \[\begin{aligned} \log_2\left(1+\frac1k\right) \log_k2 \log_{k+1}2 &= \frac{ \log_2\left(\frac{k+1}{k}\right)}{\log_2 k \log_2 (k+1)} \\ &= \frac{\log_2(k+1) - \log_2 k}{\log_2 k \log_2 (k+1)} \\ &= \frac{1}{\log_2 k} - \frac{1}{\log_2 (k+1)}
\end{aligned}\]Therefore, the sum telescopes: \[\begin{aligned} \sum_{k=2}^{63} \log_2\left(1 + \frac{1}{k}\right) \log_k 2 \log_{k+1} 2 &= \left(\frac{1}{\log_2 2} - \frac{1}{\log_2 3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\log_2 3} - \frac1{\log_2 4}\right) + \dots + \left(\frac{1}{\log_2 63} - \frac{1}{\log_2 64}\right) \\ &= \frac{1}{\log_2 2} - \frac{1}{\log_2 64} \\ &= 1 - \frac16 \\ &= \boxed{\frac56}
\end{aligned}\]
Substituting $y^2 = 8x$ into $x^2 + y^2 - 2x - 4y = 0,$ we get
\[x^2 + 6x - 4y = 0.\]Then $x^2 + 6x = 4y.$  Squaring both sides, we get
\[x^4 + 12x^3 + 36x^2 = 16y^2 = 128x.\]Hence,
\[x^4 + 12x^3 + 36x^2 - 128x = 0.\]We can take out a factor of $x,$ to get
\[x(x^3 + 12x^2 + 36x - 128) = 0.\]We can check that $x = 2$ is a root of the cubic, so we can also take out a factor of $x - 2,$ to get
\[x(x - 2)(x^2 + 14x + 64) = 0.\]The quadratic factor has no real roots, so the real solutions are $x = 0$ and $x = 2.$
For $x = 0,$ $y = 0,$ and for $x = 2,$ $y^2 = 16,$ so $y = \pm 4.$  We check that only $y = 4$ satisfies the equation of the circle
Hence, the two intersection points are $(0,0)$ and $(2,4),$ and the distance between them is $\sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{20} = \boxed{2 \sqrt{5}}.$
Let $f(x) = p(x) - 17x.$  Then $f(1) = f(2) = f(3) = 0.$  Also, $f(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree 4, so
\[f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - r),\]for some real number $r.$  Then
\[p(x) = f(x) + 17x = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - r) + 17x.\]Therefore,
\begin{align*}
p(0) + p(4) &= (0 - 1)(0 - 2)(0 - 3)(0 - r) + 17 \cdot 0 + (4 - 1)(4 - 2)(4 - 3)(4 - r) + 17 \cdot 4 \\
&= 6r + 24 - 6r + 68 \\
&= \boxed{92}.
\end{align*}
Setting $y = x$ in the second equation, we get
\[2 f \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = 1 + f \left( \frac{1}{2x} \right)
\quad (1)\]Setting $x = \frac{1}{2t},$ we find
\[2f(2t) = 1 + f(t) \quad (2)\]for all $t \in S.$
\begin{align*}
x(1 + f(x)) &= 2x f(2x) \quad \text{from (2)} \\
&= f \left( \frac{1}{2x} \right) \quad \text{from (i)} \\
&= 2 f \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) - 1 \quad \text{from (1)} \\
&= 2xf(x) - 1 \quad \text{from (i)}.
\end{align*}Solving for $f(x),$ we find
\[f(x) = \frac{1}{x} + 1.\]We can check that this function works
Therefore, $n = 1$ and $s = 2,$ so $n \times s = \boxed{2}.$
If $f(x) \ge 0,$ then $|f(x)| = f(x).$  And if $f(x) < 0,$ then $|f(x)| = -f(x).$  Thus, the graph of $y = |f(x)|$ is obtained by taking the graph of $y = f(x),$ and reflecting everything below the $x$-axis about the $x$-axis
The correct graph is $\boxed{\text{D}}.$
By the Triangle Inequality,
\[|z - 3i| + |z - 4| = |z - 4| + |3i - z| \ge |(z - 4) + (3i - z)| = |-4 + 3i| = 5.\]But we are told that $|z - 3i| + |z - 4| = 5.$  The only way that equality can occur is if $z$ lies on the line segment connecting 4 and $3i$ in the complex plane.

We want to minimize $|z|$
We see that $|z|$ is minimized when $z$ coincides with the projection of the origin onto the line segment.
The area of the triangle with vertices 0, 4, and $3i$ is
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 6.\]This area is also
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot 5 \cdot h = \frac{5h}{2},\]so $h = \boxed{\frac{12}{5}}.$
We use the fact that $\lfloor x \rfloor = x - \{x\}$ for all $x.$ Therefore, it suffices to compute the sum of the arithmetic sequence itself, \[1 + 1.6 + 2.2 + \dots + 100,\]and then subtract off the sum of the fractional parts, \[\{1\} + \{1.6\} + \{2.2\} + \dots + \{100\}.\]The common difference of the arithmetic sequence is $0.6,$ so the number of terms is $1 + \frac{100 - 1}{0.6} = 166.$ Then, the sum of the arithmetic sequence is \[\frac{1 + 100}{2} \cdot 166 = 101 \cdot 83 = 8383.\]Because five times the common difference is $5 \cdot 0.6 = 3,$ which is an integer, the fractional parts of the arithmetic sequence repeat every five terms
Thus, the sum of the fractional parts is \[\frac{165}{5} \left( 0 + 0.6 + 0.2 + 0.8 + 0.4 \right) + 0 = 33 \cdot 2 = 66.\]Therefore, the given sum equals \[8383 - 66 = \boxed{8317} \,.\]
We have $91=a^3+b^3=(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)=(a+b)((a+b)^2-3ab)=7\cdot (49-3ab)$, from which $ab=\boxed{12}$.
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
x + y &= \frac{x}{5} + \frac{x}{5} + \frac{x}{5} + \frac{x}{5} + \frac{x}{5} + \frac{y}{2} + \frac{y}{2} \\
&\ge 7 \sqrt[7]{\left( \frac{x}{5} \right)^5 \left( \frac{y}{2} \right)^2} \\
&= 7 \sqrt[7]{\frac{x^5 y^2}{5^5 \cdot 2^2}}.
\end{align*}Since $x + y = 35,$ this gives us
\[x^5 y^2 \le 5^7 \cdot 5^5 \cdot 2^2,\]and equality occurs when $x + y = 35$ and $\frac{x}{5} = \frac{y}{2}.$  We can solve, we get $(x,y) = \boxed{(25,10)}.$
To work with the absolute values, we take cases on the value of $x$:
For $x < 0,$ we have $(60-x) + |y| = -\frac{x}{4},$ or $|y| = \frac{3x}{4} - 60.$ But $|y|$ is always nonnegative, whereas $\frac{3x}{4}-60 < -60$ whenever $x < 0.$ So no part of the graph of the given equation has $x < 0.$
For $0 \le x < 60,$ we have $(60-x) + |y| = \frac{x}{4},$ or $|y| = \frac{5x}{4} - 60.$ Since $\frac{5x}{4} - 60 \ge 0$ when $x \ge 48,$ the graph of the equation consists of two line segments, one from $(48,0)$ to $(60,15),$ and another from $(48,0)$ to $(60,-15).$
For $60 \le x,$ we have $(x-60) + |y| = \frac{x}{4},$ or $|y| = -\frac{3x}{4} + 60.$ Since $-\frac{3x}{4} + 60 \ge 0$ when $x \le 80,$ the graph of this equation consists of two line segments, one from $(60,15)$ to $(80,0),$ and another from $(60,-15)$ to $(80,0).$
Altogether, the graph of this equation is a kite, with diagonals of length $80 - 48 = 32$ and $15 - (-15) = 30.$ Therefore, the area of the enclosed region is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 32 \cdot 30 = \boxed{480}.$

Since $\lfloor{x}\rfloor>x-1$ for all $x$, we have that
\begin{align*}
\Big\lfloor{\frac{a+b}{c}}\Big\rfloor+\Big\lfloor{\frac{b+c}{a}}\Big\rfloor+\Big\lfloor{\frac{c+a}{b}}\Big\rfloor&>\frac{a+b}{c}+\frac{b+c}{a}+\frac{c+a}{b}-3\\
&=\left(\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{a}\right)+\left(\frac{b}{c}+\frac{c}{b}\right)+\left(\frac{c}{a}+\frac{a}{c}\right)-3.
\end{align*}But by the AM-GM inequality, each of the first three terms in the last line is at least 2
Therefore, the lefthand side is greater than $2+2+2-3=3$
Since it is an integer, the smallest value it can be is therefore $\boxed{4}$
This is in fact attainable by letting $(a,b,c)=(6,8,9)$.
We recognize $729x^3+8$ as a sum of cubes
We can write $729x^3+8$ as $(9x)^3+2^3$
We know the formula: $$a^3+b^3= (a+b)(a^{2}-ab+b^{2})
$$Thus, $$ (9x)^3+2^3=(9x+2)(81x^2-18x+4).$$Therefore, $a+b+c+d+e=9+2+81-18+4=\boxed{78}$.
Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get
\[9(x + 3)^2 - (y - 5)^2 = 1,\]which we can write as
\[\frac{(x + 3)^2}{1/9} - \frac{(y - 5)^2}{1} = 1.\]Thus, $a^2 = \frac{1}{9}$ and $b^2 = 1,$ so $a = \frac{1}{3}.$  Therefore, the distance between the vertices is $2a = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.$
From the given equation,
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} - 4 \sqrt[3]{x} = 0.\]We can also write this as
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} + \sqrt[3]{-64x} = 0.\]Let $a = \sqrt[3]{15x - 1},$ $b = \sqrt[3]{13x + 1},$ and $c = \sqrt[3]{-64x},$ so $a + b + c = 0.$  From the factorization
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ab - bc),\]we have that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc.$  Hence,
\[-36x = 3 \sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)(-64x)}.\]We can simplify this to
\[3x = \sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)x}.\]Cubing both sides we, get $27x^3 = 195x^3 + 2x^2 - x,$ so $168x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0.$  This factors as $x(14x - 1)(12x + 1) = 0,$ so the solutions are $\boxed{0, \frac{1}{14}, -\frac{1}{12}}.$
Let $r$ be the radius of such a circle
Since the circle is tangent to the positive $x$-axis and positive $y$-axis, its center is $(r,r).$  This circle is also tangent to the circle centered at $(3,0)$ with radius 1, so
\[(r - 3)^2 + r^2 = (r + 1)^2.\]This simplifies to $r^2 - 8r + 8 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula, the roots are $r = 4 \pm 2 \sqrt{2}.$  Thus, the sum of all possible values of $r$ is $\boxed{8}.$

By AM-GM,
\[4x + \frac{1}{x^4} = x + x + x + x + \frac{1}{x^4} \ge 5 \sqrt[5]{x^4 \cdot \frac{1}{x^4}} = 5.\]Equality occurs when $x = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{5}.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
\frac{2016}{1} + \frac{2015}{2} + \frac{2014}{3} + \dots + \frac{1}{2016} &= \frac{2017 - 1}{1} + \frac{2017 - 2}{2} + \frac{2017 - 3}{3} + \dots + \frac{2017 - 2016}{2016} \\
&= \frac{2017}{1} - 1  +\frac{2017}{2} - 1 + \frac{2017}{3} - 1 + \dots + \frac{2017}{2016} - 1 \\
&= \frac{2017}{1} + \frac{2017}{2} + \frac{2017}{3} + \dots + \frac{2017}{2016} - 2016 \\
&= 2017 \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \dots + \frac{1}{2016} \right) + 1 \\
&= 2017 \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \dots + \frac{1}{2016} + \frac{1}{2017} \right).
\end{align*}Therefore,
\[\frac{\frac{2016}{1} + \frac{2015}{2} + \frac{2014}{3} + \dots + \frac{1}{2016}}{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \dots + \frac{1}{2017}} = \boxed{2017}.\]
We have that
\begin{align*}
f(11) + f(13) + f(14) &= \log_{2002} 11^2 + \log_{2002} 13^2 + \log_{2002} 14^2 \\
&= \log_{2002} (11^2 \cdot 13^2 \cdot 14^2) \\
&= \log_{2002} 2002^2 \\
&= \boxed{2}.
\end{align*}
In order to find $f^{-1}$ we substitute $f^{-1}(x)$ into our expression for $f$
This gives  \[f(f^{-1}(x))=2f^{-1}(x)+1.\]Since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$, this equation is equivalent to  \[x=2f^{-1}(x)+1,\]which simplifies to  \[f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x-1}2.\]If we assume $x$ solves $f^{-1}(x)=f(x^{-1})$, then we get  \[\frac{x-1}2=\frac 2x+1=\frac{2+x}x.\]Cross-multiplying gives  \[x^2-x=4+2x.\]Then $x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0$
Factoring gives $(x-4)(x+1)=0$, from which we find $x=4$ or $x=-1$
The sum of the solutions is $4+(-1) = \boxed{3}$.
Alternatively, since Vieta's formula tells us that the sum of the roots of a quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$ is $-\frac{b}{a}$, the sum of the roots of $x^2-3x-4$ is $-\frac{-3}{1}=\boxed{3}$.
Denote the remaining entries by $d, e, f, g, h,$ as shown: [asy]

[/asy] One possible solution proceeds in three steps, as follows:
The leftmost column and up-right diagonal have the same sum, so $x + 1 + f = 96 + d + f,$ which gives $d = x - 95.$
The down-right diagonal and the rightmost column have the same sum, so $x + (x-95) + h = 96 + e + h,$ which gives $e = 2x - 191.$
Finally, the first row and second sum have the same sum, so \[x + 19 + 96 = 1 + (x-95) + (2x-191),\]which gives $x = \boxed{200}.$
After the subtractions are performed, each fraction in the pattern has a numerator that is one less than its denominator
The product then reduces quite nicely, leaving just the frst numerator and the last denominator, as follows: $\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{3}{4}\times \cdots\times\frac{49}{50} = \boxed{\frac{1}{50}}$.
The function $a(x) = \sqrt{2 - x}$ is decreasing, so it has an inverse.
Note that $b(0) = b(1) = 0,$ so the function $b(x)$ does not have an inverse.
Note that $c \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = c(2) = \frac{5}{2},$ so the function $c(x)$ does not have an inverse.
The function $d(x) = 2x^2 + 4x + 7 = 2(x + 1)^2 + 5$ is increasing on $[0,\infty),$ so it has an inverse.
Note that $e(2) = e(-3) = 5,$ so the function $e(x)$ does not have an inverse.
Both $3^x$ and $7^x$ are increasing, so $f(x) = 3^x + 7^x$ is also increasing
Hence, it has an inverse.
Suppose $g(a) = g(b)$ for some $a,$ $b > 0.$  Then
\[a - \frac{1}{a} = b - \frac{1}{b}.\]Multiplying both sides by $ab,$ we get
\[a^2 b - b = ab^2 - a.\]Then $a^2 b - ab^2 + a - b = 0,$ which factors as $(a - b)(ab + 1) = 0.$  Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $ab + 1$ cannot be 0, so $a = b.$
We have shown that $g(a) = g(b)$ forces $a = b,$ so the function $g(x)$ has an inverse.
The function $h(x) = \frac{x}{2}$ has an inverse, namely $h^{-1}(x) = 2x.$
Thus, the letters of the functions that have inverses are $\boxed{\text{A, D, F, G, H}}.$
We can write $x - \lfloor x \rfloor = \{x\},$ so
\[\{x\}^2 + y^2 = \{x\}.\]Completing the square in $\{x\},$ we get
\[\left( \{x\} - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + y^2 = \frac{1}{4}.\]Let $n = \lfloor x \rfloor,$ so $\{x\} = x - n.$  Hence,
\[\left( x - n - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + y^2 = \frac{1}{4}.\]Consider the case where $n = 0.$  Then $0 \le x < 1,$ and the equation becomes
\[\left( x - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + y^2 = \frac{1}{4}.\]This is the equation of the circle centered at $\left( \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right)$ with radius $\frac{1}{2}.$
Now consider the case where $n = 1.$  Then $1 \le x < 2,$ and the equation becomes
\[\left( x - \frac{3}{2} \right)^2 + y^2 = \frac{1}{4}.\]This is the equation of the circle centered at $\left( \frac{3}{2}, 0 \right)$ with radius $\frac{1}{2}.$
In general, for $n \le x < n + 1,$
\[\left( x - n - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + y^2 = \frac{1}{4}\]is the equation of a circle centered at $\left( \frac{2n + 1}{2}, 0 \right)$ with radius $\frac{1}{2}.$
Thus, the graph of $\{x\}^2 + y^2 = \{x\}$ is a chain of circles, each of radius $\frac{1}{2},$ one for each integer $n.$

The graph of $y = \frac{1}{5} x$ intersects each of the six circles closest to the origin in two points
For $x > 5,$ $y > \frac{1}{2},$ so the line does not intersect any circles
Similarly, the line does not intersect any circles for $x < -5.$
One point of intersection is repeated twice, namely the origin
Hence, the number of points of intersection of the two graphs is $2 \cdot 6 - 1 = \boxed{11}.$
Let $F_1 = (3,7)$ and $F_2 = (d,7).$  Then the center of the ellipse is $C = \left( \frac{d + 3}{2}, 7 \right),$ and the point where the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis is $T = \left( \frac{d + 3}{2}, 0 \right).$

Then for any point $P$ on the ellipse, $PF_1 + PF_2 = 2 \cdot \frac{d + 3}{2} = d + 3.$  In particular, this holds for $P = T,$ so
\[2 \sqrt{\left( \frac{d - 3}{2} \right)^2 + 7^2} = d + 3.\]Then
\[\sqrt{(d - 3)^2 + 196} = d + 3.\]Squaring both sides, we get $(d - 3)^2 + 196 = d^2 + 6d + 9.$  This simplifies to $12d = 196,$ so $d = \frac{196}{12} = \boxed{\frac{49}{3}}.$
Note that
\begin{align*}
a_{2^1} &= a_2 = a_{2\cdot1} = 1\cdot a_1 = 2^0\cdot 2^0 = 2^0,\\
a_{2^2} &= a_4 = a_{2\cdot2} = 2\cdot a_2 = 2^1\cdot 2^0 = 2^1,\\
a_{2^3} &= a_8 = a_{2\cdot4} = 4\cdot a_4 = 2^2 \cdot 2^1 = 2^{1+2},\\
a_{2^4} &= a_{16} = a_{2\cdot8} = 8\cdot a_8 = 2^3\cdot 2^{1+2} = 2^{1+2+3},
\end{align*}and, in general, $a_{2^n} = 2^{1+2+\cdots+(n-1)}$
Because $$1+2+3+\cdots+(n-1) =
\frac{1}{2}n(n-1),$$we have $a_{2^{100}} = 2^{(100)(99)/2} = \boxed{2^{4950}}$.
The standard form for the equation of a vertically oriented hyperbola centered at $(h, k)$ is \[\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]But the given equation is not in standard form, because the terms $2y$ and $3x$ appear instead of $y$ and $x.$ So we factor out $2^2$ and $3^2$ from the two terms on the left-hand side, giving \[\frac{2^2(y-1)^2}{5^2} - \frac{3^2(x-\tfrac43)^2}{4^2} = 1,\]or \[\frac{(y-1)^2}{\left(\tfrac52\right)^2} - \frac{(x-\tfrac43)^2}{\left(\tfrac43\right)^2} = 1.\]This equation is in standard form, so we can read off the center of the hyperbola as $\boxed{\left(\frac43, 1\right)}.$
Note that $780=\frac 3{10}\cdot 2600$, and $1040=\frac{4}{10}\cdot 2600$
Thus, geometrically, the distance from Los Angeles to Knoxville forms a 3-4-5 right triangle, with hypotenuse of length $\frac{5}{10}\cdot 2600=\boxed{1300}$
Since magnitude of a number is defined to be the distance from the origin of that number, $1300$ is our answer.
From the given equation,
\[\sqrt{x + 4 \sqrt{x - 4}} - \sqrt{x - 4 \sqrt{x - 4}} = 4.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[x + 4 \sqrt{x - 4} - 2 \sqrt{x + 4 \sqrt{x - 4}} \sqrt{x - 4 \sqrt{x - 4}} + x - 4 \sqrt{x - 4} = 16.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
2x - 16 &= 2 \sqrt{(x + 4 \sqrt{x - 4})(x - 4 \sqrt{x - 4})} \\
&= 2 \sqrt{x^2 - 16(x - 4)} \\
&= 2 \sqrt{x^2 - 16x + 64} \\
&= 2 \sqrt{(x - 8)^2}.
\end{align*}Equivalently, $x - 8 = \sqrt{(x - 8)^2}.$  This holds if and only if $x \ge 8.$
All our steps are reversible, so the solution is $x \in \boxed{[8,\infty)}.$
$$\begin{aligned} \binom{1/2}{2014} &= \frac{(1/2)(1/2-1)(1/2-2)\dotsm(1/2-2014+1)}{2014!}  \\
&= \frac{(1/2)(-1/2)(-3/2)\dotsm(-4025/2)}{2014!} \\
&= \frac{(-1)(-3)\dotsm(-4025)}{(2014!)2^{2014}} \\
&= -\frac{(1)(3)\dotsm(4025)}{(2014!)2^{2014}} \cdot \frac{2\cdot4\cdot6\cdot\dots\cdot 4026}{2\cdot4\cdot6\cdot\dots\cdot 4026} \\
&= -\frac{4026!} {(2014!)2^{2014+2013}(2013!)} \\
\end{aligned}$$So then
$$\begin{aligned} \frac{\binom{1/2}{2014}\cdot 4^{2014}}{{4028 \choose 2014}} &= -\frac{4026!\cdot 4^{2014}} {(2014!)2^{2014+2013}(2013!){4028 \choose 2014}}  \\
&= -\frac{4026!\cdot 2^{4028}(2014!)(2014!)} {(2014!)2^{4027}(2013!)(4028!)}  \\
&= \boxed{-\frac{1} { 4027}}
\end{aligned}$$
We can factor the numerator and denominator to get $$\frac{x^2+3x+2}{x^3+x^2-2x} = \frac{(x+1)(x+2)}{x(x-1)(x+2)}.$$In this representation we can immediately see that there is a hole at $x=-2$, and vertical asymptotes at $x=1$ and $x=0$
There are no more holes or vertical asymptotes, so $a=1$ and $b=2$
If we cancel out the common factors we have
$$\frac{(x+1)(x+2)}{x(x-1)(x+2)} =\frac{x+1}{x^2-x}.$$We can now see that as $x$ becomes very large, the $x^2$ term in the denominator dominates and the graph tends towards $0$, giving us a horizontal asymptote.
Since the graph cannot have more than one horizontal asymptote, or a horizontal asymptote and a slant asymptote, we have that $c=1$ and $d=0$
Therefore, $a+2b+3c+4d = 1+2\cdot 2+3+0 = \boxed{8}.$
By symmetry, the vertices of the square are $(\pm t, \pm t)$ for some positive real number $t.$  Then
\[\frac{t^2}{3} + \frac{t^2}{6} = 1.\]Solving, we find $t^2 = 2.$  Then $t = \sqrt{2}.$
The side length of the square is then $2t = 2 \sqrt{2},$ so its area is $(2 \sqrt{2})^2 = \boxed{8}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
f(x) f(-x) &= (ax^2 + bx + c)(ax^2 - bx + c) \\
&= (ax^2 + c)^2 - (bx)^2 \\
&= a^2 x^4 + 2acx^2 + c^2 - b^2 x^2.
\end{align*}We want this to equal $f(x^2) = ax^4 + bx^2 + c.$  Comparing coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
a^2 &= a, \\
2ac - b^2 &= b, \\
c^2 &= c.
\end{align*}Thus, $a = 0$ or $a = 1,$ and $c = 0$ or $c = 1.$  We divide into cases accordingly.
If $a = 0$ or $c = 0,$ then $ac = 0,$ so
\[b^2 + b = b(b + 1) = 0,\]which means $b = 0$ or $b = -1.$
The only other case is where $a = 1$ and $c = 1.$  Then
\[b^2 + b - 2 = 0,\]which factors as $(b - 1)(b + 2) = 0.$  Hence, $b = 1$ or $b = -2.$
Therefore, there are $\boxed{8}$ such functions $f(x)$:
\[0, 1, -x, 1 - x, x^2, x^2 - x, x^2 + x + 1, x^2 - 2x + 1.\]
Note that $z^2 + 4 = (z + 2i)(z - 2i),$ so we can write the given equation as
\[|z + 2i||z - 2i| = |z||z + 2i|.\]If $|z + 2i| = 0,$ then $z = -2i,$ in which case $|z + i| = |-i| = 1.$  Otherwise, $|z + 2i| \neq 0,$ so we can divide both sides by $|z + 2i|,$ to get
\[|z - 2i| = |z|.\]This condition states that $z$ is equidistant from the origin and $2i$ in the complex plane
Thus, $z$ must lie on the perpendicular bisector of these complex numbers, which is the set of complex numbers where the imaginary part is 1.

In other words, $z = x + i$ for some real number $x.$  Then
\[|z + i| = |x + 2i| = \sqrt{x^2 + 4} \ge 2.\]Therefore, the smallest possible value of $|z + i|$ is $\boxed{1},$ which occurs for $z = -2i.$

\]So the quotient is $\boxed{z^3  -2z^2+3z-\frac{17}{3}}$.
Squaring the equation $x + y = 2,$ we get $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 4.$  Also, $4xy - 4z^2 = 4,$ so
\[x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 4xy - 4z^2.\]Then $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 + 4z^2 = 0,$ which we write as
\[(x - y)^2 + 4z^2 = 0.\]For this equation to hold, we must have $x = y$ and $z = 0,$ and if $x = y,$ then $x = y = 1.$
Therefore, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution, namely $(x,y,z) = (1,1,0).$
Let $z = a + bi.$  Then
\[z^2 = (a + bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi + b^2 i^2 = a^2 + 2ab - b^2.\]We want this to equal $-77 - 36i.$  Setting the real and imaginary parts equal, we get
\begin{align*}
a^2 - b^2 &= -77, \\
2ab &= -36,
\end{align*}so $ab = -18.$  Then $b = -\frac{18}{a}.$  Substituting, we get
\[a^2 - \frac{324}{a^2} = -77,\]so $a^4 + 77a^2 - 324 = 0.$  This factors as $(a^2 - 4)(a^2 + 81) = 0,$ so $a^2 = 4.$
If $a = 2,$ then $b = -\frac{18}{a} = -9.$  If $a = -2,$ then $b = -\frac{18}{a} = 9.$  Therefore, the solutions are $\boxed{2 - 9i, -2 + 9i}.$
We work on the two parts of the given inequality separately
First, $3 \le \frac{x}{2x-5}$ is equivalent to \[0 \le \frac{x}{2x-5} - 3 = \frac{x - 3(2x-5)}{2x-5} = \frac{-5x + 15}{2x-5}.\]Making a sign table, we have:  \begin{tabular}{c|cc|c} &$-5x+15$ &$2x-5$ &$\frac{-5x+15}{2x-5}$ \\ \hline$x<\frac{5}{2}$ &$+$&$-$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$\frac{5}{2}<x<3$ &$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$x>3$ &$-$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]\end{tabular}Therefore, the inequality holds when $\tfrac52 < x < 3,$ as well as the endpoint $x = 3,$ which makes the right-hand side zero
The solution set to the first inequality is $(\tfrac52, 3].$
Second, $\frac{x}{2x-5} < 8$ is equivalent to \[\frac{x}{2x-5} - 8 = \frac{x - 8(2x-5)}{2x-5} = \frac{-15x + 40}{2x-5} < 0.\]Making another sign table, we have: \begin{tabular}{c|cc|c} &$-15x+40$ &$2x-5$ &$\frac{-15x+40}{2x-5}$ \\ \hline$x<\frac{5}{2}$ &$+$&$-$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$\frac{5}{2}<x<\frac{8}{3}$ &$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$x>\frac{8}{3}$ &$-$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]\end{tabular}It follows that the inequality holds when either $x < \tfrac52$ or $x > \tfrac83.$
The intersection of this solution set with $(\tfrac52, 3]$ is $\boxed{(\tfrac83, 3]},$ which is the solution set for both inequalities combined.
Consider the term $\frac{1}{x_{k - 1} + 1}.$  We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $x_{k - 1},$ to get
\[\frac{x_{k - 1}}{x_{k - 1}^2 + x_{k - 1}} = \frac{x_{k - 1}}{x_k}.\]To get the sum to telescope, we can multiply the numerator and denominator again by $x_{k - 1}$:
\[\frac{x_{k - 1}^2}{x_{k - 1} x_k} = \frac{x_k - x_{k - 1}}{x_{k - 1} x_k} = \frac{1}{x_{k - 1}} - \frac{1}{x_k}.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{x_1 + 1} + \frac{1}{x_2 + 1} + \frac{1}{x_3 + 1} + \dotsb &= \left( \frac{1}{x_1} - \frac{1}{x_2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{x_2} - \frac{1}{x_3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{x_3} - \frac{1}{x_4} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \frac{1}{x_1} = \boxed{\frac{1}{115}}.
\end{align*}
By AM-GM,
\[xz + (xy + y^2 + yz) \ge 2 \sqrt{xz(xy + y^2 + yz)} = 2 \sqrt{xyz(x + y + z)}.\]But $xz + (xy + y^2 + yz) = (x + y)(y + z),$ so
\[(x + y)(y + z) \ge 2 \sqrt{xyz(x + y + z)}.\]Then $(x + y)^2 (y + z)^2 \ge 4xyz(x + y + z),$ so
\[\frac{xyz(x + y + z)}{(x + y)^2 (y + 2)^2} \le \frac{1}{4}.\]Equality occurs whenever $xz = xy + y^2 + yz.$  For example, we can take $x = 2,$ $y = 1,$ and $z = 3.$  Thus, the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}.$
Setting $x = 0$ in the second equation, we get
\[f(-1) = f(0)^2 - 2.\]Setting $x = -1$ in the second equation, we get
\[f(0) = (f(-1) + 1)^2 - 1.\]Let $a = f(0)$ and $b = f(-1)$; then $b = a^2 - 2$ and $a = (b + 1)^2 - 1.$  Substituting $b = a^2 - 2,$ we get
\[a = (a^2 - 1)^2 - 1.\]This simplifies to $a^4 - 2a^2 - a = 0,$ which factors as $a(a + 1)(a^2 - a - 1) = 0.$  The quadratic $a^2 - a - 1 = 0$ has no integer solutions, so $a = 0$ or $a = -1.$
Suppose $f(0) = a = 0.$  Then $f(-1) = -2.$  Setting $x = -1$ in the first equation, we get
\[f(3) - f(-1) = 12,\]so $f(3) = f(-1) + 12 = 10.$  But setting $x = 2$ in the second equation, we get
\[f(3) = (f(2) - 2)^2 + 2,\]so $(f(2) - 2)^2 = 8.$  No integer value for $f(2)$ satisfies this equation.
Therefore, $f(0) = a = -1.$  Setting $x = 1$ in the second equation, we get
\[f(0) = (f(1) - 1)^2 - 1,\]so $(f(1) - 1)^2 = 0,$ which forces $f(1) = 1.$
Hence, $(f(0),f(1)) = \boxed{(-1,1)}.$  Note that the function $f(n) = n^2 + n - 1$ satisfies the given conditions.
Since $f(x)=x^2$, $f(g(x))=g(x)^2$
Therefore, $g(x)^2=4x^2+4x+1=(2x+1)^2$ and $g(x)=\boxed{2x+1}$ or $g(x)=\boxed{-2x-1}$.
Setting $x = 10,$ we get
\[(b + 10)(c + 10) = 1.\]Either $b + 10 = c + 10 = 1$ or $b + 10 = c + 10 = -1.$
If $b + 10 = c + 10 = 1,$ then $b = c = -9,$ and
\[(x - a)(x - 10) + 1 = (x - 9)^2.\]Since $(x - 9)^2 - 1 = (x - 10)(x - 8),$ $a = 8.$
If $b + 10 = c + 10 = -1,$ then $b = c = 11,$ and
\[(x - a)(x - 10) + 1 = (x - 11)^2.\]Since $(x - 11)^2 - 1 = (x - 12)(x - 10),$ $a = 12.$
Thus, the possible values of $a$ are $\boxed{8,12}.$
By definition of $S_n,$ we can write $a_n = S_n - S_{n - 1}.$  Then
\[S_n - S_{n - 1} = \frac{2S_n^2}{2S_n - 1},\]so $(2S_n - 1)(S_n - S_{n - 1}) = 2S_n^2.$  This simplifies to
\[S_{n - 1} = 2S_{n - 1} S_n + S_n.\]If $S_n = 0,$ then $S_{n - 1} = 0.$  This tells us that if $S_n = 0,$ then all previous sums must be equal to 0 as well
Since $S_1 = 1,$ we conclude that all the $S_n$ are nonzero
Thus, we can divide both sides by $S_{n - 1} S_n,$ to get
\[\frac{1}{S_n} = \frac{1}{S_{n - 1}} + 2.\]Since $\frac{1}{S_1} = 1,$ it follows that $\frac{1}{S_2} = 3,$ $\frac{1}{S_3} = 5,$ and so on
In general,
\[\frac{1}{S_n} = 2n - 1,\]so $S_n = \frac{1}{2n - 1}.$
Therefore,
\[a_{100} = S_{100} - S_{99} = \frac{1}{199} - \frac{1}{197} = \boxed{-\frac{2}{39203}}.\]
We can build a sign chart, but since all of the factors are linear, we can track what happens to the expression as $x$ increases
At $x = 0,$ the expression is positive
As $x$ increases past 1, the expression becomes negative
As $x$ increases past 2, the expression becomes positive, and so on
Thus, the solution is
\[x \in \boxed{(-\infty,1) \cup (2,3) \cup (4,5) \cup (6,\infty)}.\]
Let $x = ki,$ where $k$ is a real number
Then the given equation becomes
\[(ki)^4 - 3(ki)^3 + 5(ki)^2 - 27(ki) - 36 = 0,\]which simplifies to
\[k^4 + 3ik^3 - 5k^2 - 27ik - 36 = 0.\]The imaginary part must be 0, so $3ik^3 - 27ik = 3ik(k^2 - 9) = 0.$
Since $k = 0$ does not work, we must have $k = \pm 3$
Therefore, the pure imaginary solutions are $\boxed{3i,-3i}.$
First,
\[\frac{1 + i}{1 - i} = \frac{(1 + i)(1 + i)}{(1 - i)(1 + i)} = \frac{1 + 2i + i^2}{1 - i^2} = \frac{1 + 2i - 1}{1 + 1} = \frac{2i}{2} = i.\]So,
\[\left( \frac{1 + i}{1 - i} \right)^{1000} = i^{1000} = (i^2)^{500} = (-1)^{500} = \boxed{1}.\]
In an effort to factor this quartic polynomial, we try completing the square
If we square $x^2 + p,$ then we get
\[(x^2 + p)^2 = x^4 + 2px^2 + p^2,\]which gives us a term of $x^4.$  Thus,
\begin{align*}
x^4 - 4x - 1 &= (x^2 + p)^2 - 2px^2 - p^2 - 4x - 1 \\
&= (x^2 + p)^2 - (2px^2 + 4x + p^2 + 1).
\end{align*}If we can choose a value of $p$ such that $2px^2 + 4x + p^2 + 1$ is the square of a binomial, then we can factor the quartic using the difference-of-squares factorization.
The quadratic $2px^2 + 4x + p^2 + 1$ is a perfect square if and only if its discriminant is 0, so
\[4^2 - 4(2p)(p^2 + 1) = 0.\]This simplifies to $p^3 + p - 2 = 0.$  We see that $p = 1$ is a root.
Then for $p = 1,$ we get
\begin{align*}
x^4 - 4x - 1 &= (x^2 + 1)^2 - (2x^2 + 4x + 2) \\
&= (x^2 + 1) - 2 (x^2 + 2x + 1) \\
&= (x^2 + 1) - [(x + 1) \sqrt{2}]^2 \\
&= (x^2 + (x + 1) \sqrt{2} + 1)(x^2 - (x + 1) \sqrt{2} + 1) \\
&= (x^2 + x \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} + 1)(x^2 - x \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2} + 1).
\end{align*}The discriminant of the first quadratic factor is negative, so it has no real roots
The discriminant of the second quadratic factor is positive, so $a$ and $b$ are the roots of this quadratic.
Then by Vieta's formulas, $a + b = \sqrt{2}$ and $ab = -\sqrt{2} + 1,$ so $ab + a + b = \boxed{1}.$
By partial fractions,
$$\frac{-x^2+3x-4}{x^3+x}=\frac{-x^2+3x-4}{x(x^2+1)} = \frac{A}{x} +\frac{Bx+C}{x^2+1} $$Multiplying by $x(x^2+1)$ gives
$$-x^2+3x-4 = (A+B)x^2 +Cx + A.$$By comparing coefficients, we can see that $A=-4$ and $C=3.$ Then, $-4+B=-1$ which means $B=3$.
$$\frac{-x^2+3x-4}{x^3+x} = \frac{-4}{x}+\frac{3x+3}{x^2+1}.$$and $(A,B,C) = \boxed{(-4,3,3)}.$
Using long division,

\]So the quotient is $\boxed{4x^2 -2x + \frac{3}{2}} $.
Solution 1
The first equation gives $x = y+4$
Substituting into the second equation, we get \[(y+4)^3 - y^3 = 28 \implies 12y^2 + 48y + 36 = 0.\]Thus, $y^2 + 4y + 3 = 0$, so $(y+1)(y+3) = 0$
Therefore, either $y=-1$ and $x=y+4=3$, or $y=-3$ and $x=y+4=1$
Either way, $xy = \boxed{-3}$.
Solution 2
The second equation factors via difference of cubes, as \[(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2) = 28.\]Since $x-y=4$, we have $x^2+xy+y^2=\frac{28}{4} =7$
Now, squaring the first equation, we get $x^2-2xy+y^2=16$
Thus, \[3xy = (x^2+xy+y^2) - (x^2-2xy+y^2) = 7-16=-9,\]so $xy = \frac{-9}{3} = \boxed{-3}$.
We have that
\[\sum_{i = 0}^{50} a_i x^i = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{3} x + \frac{1}{6} x^2 \right) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{3} x^3 + \frac{1}{6} x^6 \right) \dotsm \left( 1 - \frac{1}{3} x^9 + \frac{1}{6} x^{18} \right).\]If we multiply this out (which we're not going to do), this involves taking a term from the first factor $1 - \frac{1}{3} x + \frac{1}{6} x^2,$ a term from the second factor $1 - \frac{1}{3} x^3 + \frac{1}{6} x^6,$ and so on, until we take a term from the fifth factor $1 - \frac{1}{3} x^9 + \frac{1}{6} x^{18},$ and taking the product of these terms.
Suppose the product of the terms is of the form $cx^n,$ where $n$ is even
Then the number of terms of odd degree, like $-\frac{1}{3} x$ and $-\frac{1}{3} x^3,$ that contributed must have been even
These are the only terms from each factor that are negative, so $c$ must be positive.
Similarly, if $n$ is odd, then the number of terms of odd degree that contributed must be odd
Therefore, $c$ is negative
Hence,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i = 0}^{50} |a_i| &= |a_0| + |a_1| + |a_2| + \dots + |a_{50}| \\
&= a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - \dots + a_{50} \\
&= Q(-1) \\
&= P(-1)^5 \\
&= \left( 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} \right)^5 \\
&= \boxed{\frac{243}{32}}.
\end{align*}
For such a set $\{a, b, c, d\},$ the six pairwise sums can be themselves paired up into three pairs which all have the same sum: \[\begin{aligned} a+b\; &\text{ with } \;c+d, \\  a+c\; &\text{ with }\; b+d, \\  a+d \;&\text{ with } \;b+c
\end{aligned}\]Thus, the sum of all six pairwise sums is $3S,$ where $S = a+b+c+d,$ and so in our case, \[x+y=3S - (189 + 320 + 287 + 234) = 3S - 1030.\]Therefore, we want to maximize $S.$
Because of the pairing of the six pairwise sums, $S$ must be the sum of two of the four given numbers $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ and $234,$ so the greatest possible value of $S$ is $320 + 287 = 607.$ Therefore, the greatest possible value of $x+y$ is $3(607) - 1030 = 791.$ This value is achievable for the set $\{51.5, 137.5, 182.5, 235.5\},$ which has pairwise sums $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ $234,$ $373,$ and $418.$ Therefore the answer is $\boxed{791}.$
Let $m$ and $n$ denote the number of 1's and $-1$'s among the $a_i,$ respectively
Then $m + n = 95$ and
\[a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_{95}^2 = 95.\]Let
\[S = \sum_{1 \le i < j \le 95} a_i a_j.\]Then
\[2S + 95 = (a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{95})^2 = (m - n)^2.\]Note that $m - n = m + n - 2n = 95 - 2n$ is odd, so $(m - n)^2$ is an odd perfect square
To minimize $S,$ while still keeping it positive, we take $(m - n)^2$ as the smallest odd perfect square greater than 95, which is 121
Then $S = \frac{121 - 95}{2} = 13.$
Equality occurs when $m = 53$ and $n = 42,$ so the smallest possible positive value of $S$ is $\boxed{13}.$
By Vieta's formulas, $a + b = -a$ and $ab = b.$  Since $b$ is nonzero, $a = 1.$  Then $b = -2a = -2,$ so $(a,b) = \boxed{(1,-2)}.$
Note that $f(x) = \sqrt[3]{20x + \sqrt[3]{20x + 13}}$ is an increasing function, so the solution to
\[\sqrt[3]{20x + \sqrt[3]{20x + 13}} = 13\]is unique
Furthermore, if $\sqrt[3]{20x + 13} = 13,$ then $x$ satisfies the given equation
Thus, $20x + 13 = 13^3 = 2197,$ so $x = \boxed{\frac{546}{5}}.$
By the Integer Root Theorem, any integer root must divide 7
Thus, the possible values of the integer root are 1, 7, $-1,$ and $-7.$
We can plug in each integer root separately to see what $a$ is in each case
For $x = 1,$
\[1 + 3 + a + 7 = 0,\]so $a = -11.$  For $x = 7,$ $a = -71.$  For $x = -1,$ $a = 9.$  For $x = -7,$ $a = -27.$
Thus, the possible values of $a$ are $\boxed{-71, -27, -11, 9}.$
We claim that the minimum value is $-101.$
If $a = -1$ and $b = -100,$ then $ab = 100$ and $a + b = -101.$
\begin{align*}
a + b + 101 &= a + \frac{100}{a} + 101 \\
&= \frac{a^2 + 101a + 100}{a} \\
&= \frac{(a + 1)(a + 100)}{a}.
\end{align*}If $a$ is positive, then $b$ is positive, so $a + b$ is positive, so suppose $a$ is negative
Then $b$ is negative
Furthermore, since $a$ is a factor of 100, $-100 \le a \le -1.$  Hence, $a + 1 \le 0$ and $a + 100 \ge 0,$ so
\[a + b + 101 = \frac{(a + 1)(a + 100)}{a} \ge 0.\]Equality occurs if and only if $a = -1$ or $a = -100,$ both of which lead to $a + b = -101.$
Therefore, the minimum value of $a + b$ is $\boxed{-101}.$
We have that
\[1 + 5x + 9x^2 + 13x^3 + \dotsb = 85.\]Multiplying both sides by $x,$ we get
\[x + 5x^2 + 9x^3 + 13x^4 + \dotsb = 85x.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[1 + 4x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + \dotsb = 85 - 85x.\]Then
\[1 + \frac{4x}{1 - x} = 85 - 85x.\]Multiplying both sides by $1 - x,$ we get
\[1 - x + 4x = (85 - 85x)(1 - x).\]This simplifies to $85x^2 - 173x + 84 = 0,$ which factors as $(5x - 4)(17x - 21) = 0.$  Hence, $x = \frac{4}{5}$ or $x = \frac{21}{17}.$
In order for the series $1 + 5x + 9x^2 + 13x^3 + \dotsb$ to converge, the value of $x$ must lie strictly between $-1$ and 1
Therefore, $x = \boxed{\frac{4}{5}}.$
From the equation $z + \frac{1}{z} = r,$ $z^2 + 1 = rz,$ so
\[z^2 - rz + 1 = 0.\]By the quadratic equation,
\[z = \frac{r \pm \sqrt{r^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{r \pm i \sqrt{4 - r^2}}{2}.\]Then
\[|z| = \sqrt{\left( \frac{r}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{4 - r^2}}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{r^2}{4} + \frac{4 - r^2}{4}} = \boxed{1}.\]
Since $PA + PD = 8,$ point $P$ must lie on the ellipse whose foci are $A$ and $D,$ and whose major axis has length $8.$ Since the distance between the foci is $3 - (-3) = 6,$ the minor axis has length $\sqrt{8^2 - 6^2} = 2\sqrt{7}.$ Then the semi-axes have lengths $4$ and $\sqrt{7},$ respectively, and the center of the ellipse is $(0,0),$ so the equation of this ellipse is \[\frac{x^2}{16} + \frac{y^2}{7} = 1.\]Similarly, since $PB+PC=8,$ point $P$ must lie on the ellipse whose foci are $B$ and $C,$ and whose major axis has length $8.$ Since the distance between the foci is $2-(-2) = 4,$ the minor axis has length $\sqrt{8^2-4^2} = 4\sqrt{3}.$ Then the semi-axes have lengths $4$ and $2\sqrt{3},$ respectively, and the center of the ellipse is $(0,1),$ so the equation of this ellipse is \[\frac{x^2}{16} + \frac{(y-1)^2}{12} = 1.\]Both ellipses are shown below
(Note that they intersect at two different points, but that they appear to have the same $y-$coordinate.) [asy]
size(7cm);
pair A=(-3,0),B=(-2,1),C=(2,1),D=(3,0);
path ellipse1 = xscale(4)*yscale(sqrt(7))*unitcircle, ellipse2 = shift((0,1))*xscale(4)*yscale(sqrt(12))*unitcircle;

Since $P$ lies on both ellipses, it must satisfy both equations, where $P=(x,y).$ We solve for $y.$ By comparing the two equations, we get \[\frac{y^2}{7} = \frac{(y-1)^2}{12}.\]Cross-multiplying and rearranging, we get the quadratic \[5y^2 + 14y - 7 = 0,\]and so by the quadratic formula, \[y=\frac{-14 \pm \sqrt{14^2 + 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 7}}{10} = \frac{-7 \pm 2\sqrt{21}}{5}.\]It remains to determine which value of $y$ is valid
Since $\sqrt{21} > 4,$ we have \[\frac{-7 - 2\sqrt{21}}{5} < \frac{-7 -2 \cdot 4}{5} = -3.\]But the smallest possible value of $y$ for a point on the ellipse $\frac{x^2}{16} + \frac{y^2}{7} = 1$ is $-\sqrt{7},$ which is greater than $-3.$ Therefore, we must choose the $+$ sign, and so \[y = \frac{-7 + 2\sqrt{21}}{5}.\]The final answer is $7 + 2 + 21 + 5 = \boxed{35}.$
The four points $(0,0),$ $(0,2),$ $(3,0),$ and $(3,2)$ form a rectangle, and the horizontal line through $(-\tfrac32, 1)$ bisects the rectangle
So, visually, we hope that the center of the ellipse coincides with the center of the rectangle, which has coordinates $\left(\tfrac32, 1\right),$ and that its major axis should pass through the point $(-\tfrac32, 1).$
In this case, the semimajor axis has length $\tfrac32 - (-\tfrac32) = 3.$ Then, its equation must take the form \[\frac{(x-\tfrac32)^2}{3^2} + \frac{(y-1)^2}{b^2} = 1\]where $b$ is the length of the semiminor axis
Since $(0,0)$ lies on the ellipse, setting $x=y=0,$ we have \[\frac{\left(\frac32\right)^2}{3^2} + \frac{1}{b^2} = 1,\]or $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{b^2} = 1.$ Solving for $b$ gives $b = \frac{2\sqrt3}{3},$ so the length of the minor axis is $2b = \boxed{\frac{4\sqrt3}{3}}.$
The sum of the distances from $(0,0)$ to the two foci is $ 2 + 3 = 5.$ By the definition of an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci must also be $5.$ So, in particular, if $(x, 0)$ is the other $x$-intercept, the distance formula gives \[|x-3| + \sqrt{x^2+4} = 5.\]Drawing out the ellipse, we see that $x>3,$ so we can drop the absolute values around $x-3.$ Then, solving for $x$, we have \[\begin{aligned} \sqrt{x^2+4} &= 8-x \\ x^2+4 &= x^2-16x+64 \\ 16x &= 60, \end{aligned}\]so $x = \tfrac{60}{16} = \tfrac{15}{4}.$ Thus the answer is $\boxed{\left(\tfrac{15}{4},0\right)}.$
Let $w = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers
Then the sum of the three roots is
\[(w + 3i) + (w + 9i) + (2w - 4) = 4w - 4 + 12i = 4x + 4yi - 4 + 12i.\]By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $-a,$ are real number
Hence, $(4x - 4) + (4y + 12)i$ must be a real number, which means $y = -3.$  Thus, the three roots are $w + 3i = x,$ $w + 9i = x + 6i,$ and $2w - 4 = 2x - 4 - 6i.$
Since the coefficients of $P(z)$ are all real, the nonreal roots must come in conjugate pairs
Thus, $x + 6i$ must be the conjugate of $2x - 4 - 6i,$ which means $x = 2x - 4.$  Hence, $x = 4,$ so
\[P(z) = (z - 4)(z - 4 - 6i)(z - 4 + 6i).\]In particular,
\[P(1) = (1 - 4)(1 - 4 - 6i)(1 - 4 + 6i) = -135.\]But $P(1) = 1 + a + b + c,$ so $a + b + c = \boxed{-136}.$
If a polynomial has real coefficients, then any complex conjugate of a root must also be a root
Hence, the other root is $-2 + i \sqrt{5}.$  Thus, the polynomial is
\[(x + 2 + i \sqrt{5})(x + 2 - i \sqrt{5}) = (x + 2)^2 - 5i^2 = \boxed{x^2 + 4x + 9}.\]
Since $q(x)$ is quadratic, and we have a horizontal asymptote at $y=0,$ we know that $p(x)$ must be linear.
Since we have a hole at $x=0,$ there must be a factor of $x$ in both $p(x)$ and $q(x).$ Lastly, since there is a vertical asymptote at $x=1,$ the denominator $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x-1.$ Then, $p(x) = ax$ and $q(x) = bx(x-1),$ for some constants $a$ and $b.$ Since $p(3) = 3,$ we have $3a = 3$ and hence $a=1.$ Since $q(2) = 2,$ we have $2b(2-1) = 2$ and hence $b=1.$
So $p(x) = x$ and $q(x) = x(x - 1) = x^2 - x,$ and $p(x) + q(x) = \boxed{x^2}$.
\[S = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{k^2}{2^k} = \frac{1^2}{2} + \frac{2^2}{2^2} + \frac{3^2}{2^3} + \frac{4^2}{2^4} + \dotsb.\]Then
\[2S = 1 + \frac{2^2}{2} + \frac{3^2}{2^2} + \frac{4^2}{2^3} + \frac{5^2}{2^4} + \dotsb.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[S = 1 + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{5}{2^2} + \frac{7}{2^3} + \frac{9}{2^4} + \dotsb.\]Then
\[2S = 2 + 3 + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{7}{2^2} + \frac{9}{2^3} + \frac{11}{2^4} + \dotsb.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[S = 4 + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2^2} + \frac{2}{2^3} + \frac{2}{2^4} + \dotsb = 4 + \frac{1}{1 - 1/2} = \boxed{6}.\]
Let's write $x^2+2x+5$ in the form $(x-3)(x+a)+c$ for some integers $a$ and $c$
Since $(x-3)(x+a)=x^2+(a-3)x-3a$, we set $a-3=2$ to find $a=5$
Expanding $(x-3)(x+5)$, we find $c=20$
\frac{x^2+2x+5}{x-3}=x+5+\frac{20}{x-3}.
\] Since $x+5$ is always an integer, $\frac{x^2+2x+5}{x-3}$ is an integer if and only if $\frac{20}{x-3}$ is an integer
The largest divisor of 20 is 20, so $\boxed{23}$ is the largest value of $x$ for which $\frac{x^2+2x+5}{x-3}$ is an integer.
Each of the fractions $\frac{5}{3},$ $\frac{15}{9},$ $\frac{25}{15},$ $\frac{35}{21}$ reduce to $\frac{5}{3},$ and each of the fractions $\frac{6}{10},$ $\frac{12}{20},$ $\frac{18}{30},$ $\frac{24}{40}$ reduce to $\frac{3}{5}.$  Therefore, the product of all eight fractions is $\boxed{1}.$
Setting $a = 0$ and $b = 0$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[2f(0) = 2f[(0)]^2.\]Hence, $f(0) = 0$ or $f(0) = 1.$
Setting $a = 0$ and $b = 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[2f(1) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(1)]^2.\]If $f(0) = 0,$ then $2f(1) = [f(1)]^2,$ which means $f(1) = 0$ or $f(1) = 2.$  If $f(0) = 1,$ then $[f(1)]^2 - 2f(1) + 1 = [f(1) - 1]^2 = 0,$ so $f(1) = 1.$
We divide into cases accordingly, but before we do so, note that we can get to $f(25)$ with the following values:
\begin{align*}
a = 1, b = 1: \ & 2f(2) = 2[f(1)]^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f(2) = [f(1)]^2 \\
a = 1, b = 2: \ & 2f(5) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(2)]^2 \\
a = 0, b = 5: \ & 2f(25) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(5)]^2
\end{align*}Case 1: $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 0.$
From the equations above, $f(2) = [f(1)]^2 = 0,$ $2f(5) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(2)]^2 = 0$ so $f(5) = 0,$ and $2f(25) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(5)]^2 = 0,$ so $f(25) = 0.$
Note that the function $f(n) = 0$ satisfies the given functional equation, which shows that $f(25)$ can take on the value of 0.
Case 2: $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 2.$
From the equations above, $f(2) = [f(1)]^2 = 4,$ $2f(5) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(2)]^2 = 20$ so $f(5) = 10,$ and $2f(25) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(5)]^2 = 100,$ so $f(25) = 50.$
Note that the function $f(n) = 2n$ satisfies the given functional equation, which shows that $f(25)$ can take on the value of 50.
Case 3: $f(0) = 1$ and $f(1) = 1.$
From the equations above, $f(2) = [f(1)]^2 = 1,$ $2f(5) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(2)]^2 = 2$ so $f(5) = 1,$ and $2f(25) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(5)]^2 = 2,$ so $f(25) = 1.$
Note that the function $f(n) = 1$ satisfies the given functional equation, which shows that $f(25)$ can take on the value of 1.
Hence, there are $n = 3$ different possible values of $f(25),$ and their sum is $s = 0 + 50 + 1 = 51,$ which gives a final answer of $n \times s = 3 \times 51 = \boxed{153}$.
By Vieta's formulas, \[t = -(a+b)(b+c)(c+a).\]From the first cubic polynomial, we have $a+b+c=-3$
Using this equation, we can rewrite the expression for $t$ as \[t = -(-3-c)(-3-a)(-3-b).\]To compute this expression quickly, notice that, for any $x$, \[x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x - 11 = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)\]by the factor theorem
Setting $x = -3$, we get \[(-3)^3 + 3(-3)^2 + 4(-3) - 11 = -23 = (-3-a)(-3-b)(-3-c).\]Thus, $t = -(-23) = \boxed{23}$.
We first notice that we can simplify the fraction: \[\frac{x^3+2x^2}{x^2+3x+2} = \frac{x^2(x+2)}{(x+1)(x+2)} = \frac{x^2}{x+1},\]provided that $x \neq -2.$ Therefore, we have \[\frac{x^2}{x+1} + x = -6.\]Multiplying both sides by $x+1$ gives \[x^2 + x(x+1) = -6(x+1),\]or \[2x^2+7x+6=0.\]This equation factors as \[(2x+3)(x+2) = 0,\]so $x = -\tfrac32$ or $x = -2.$ But, as we said before, $x = -2$ is impossible because it makes the denominator of the fraction equal to zero
Therefore, the only valid solution is $x = \boxed{-\tfrac32}.$
We have \begin{align*}
\log_a \frac{a}{b} + \log_b \frac{b}{a}=& \log_a a - \log_a b + \log_b b - \log_b a\\
=&1 - \log_a b + 1 - \log_b a\\
=&2 - \log_a b - \log_b a.
\end{align*}Let $c = \log_a b$, and note that $c>0$ since $a$ and $b$ are both greater than 1
Thus \[
\log_a \frac{a}{b} + \log_b \frac{b}{a}= 2 - c - \frac{1}{c} = \frac{c^2 - 2c + 1}{-c}=
\frac{(c-1)^2}{-c}\le 0.
\]This expression is 0 when $c=1$, that is, when $a=b$
Hence the answer is $\boxed{0}$.
Let $q(x) = xp(x) - 1.$  Then $q(x)$ has degree 7, and $q(2^n) = 0$ for $n = 0,$ 1, 2, $\dots,$ 6, so
\[q(x) = c(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 2^2) \dotsm (x - 2^6)\]for some constant $c.$
We know that $q(0) = 0 \cdot p(0) - 1.$  Setting $x = 0$ in the equation above, we get
\[q(0) = c(-1)(-2)(-2^2) \dotsm (-2^6) = -2^{21} c,\]so $c = \frac{1}{2^{21}}.$  Hence,
\begin{align*}
q(x) &= \frac{(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 2^2) \dotsm (x - 2^6)}{2^{21}} \\
&= (x - 1) \left( \frac{x}{2} - 1 \right) \left( \frac{x}{2^2} - 1 \right) \dotsm \left( \frac{x}{2^6} - 1 \right).
\end{align*}The coefficient of $x$ in $q(x)$ is then
\begin{align*}
&[(1)(-1)(-1) \dotsm (-1)] + \left[ (-1) \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) (-1) \dotsm (-1) \right] + \left[ (-1)(-1) \left( \frac{1}{2^2} \right) \dotsm (-1) \right] + \left[ (-1) \dotsm (-1) \left( -\frac{1}{2^6} \right) \right] \\
&= 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{2^6} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{2^7}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 - \frac{1}{64} = \frac{127}{64}.
\end{align*}Also, the constant coefficient in $q(x)$ is $-1,$ so $q(x)$ is of the form
\[q(x) = \frac{1}{2^{21}} x^7 + \dots + \frac{127}{64} x - 1.\]Then
\[p(x) = \frac{q(x) + 1}{x} = \frac{1}{2^{21}} x^6 + \dots + \frac{127}{64}.\]Therefore, $p(0) = \boxed{\frac{127}{64}}.$
We know that $a_n + a_{n + 1} + a_{n + 2} = n$ and $a_{n - 1} + a_n + a_{n + 1} = n - 1.$  Subtracting these equations, we get
\[a_{n + 2} - a_{n - 1} = 1,\]so $a_{n + 2} = a_{n - 1} + 1.$
Hence, the terms
\[a_1 = 2007, \ a_4, \ a_7, \ a_{10}, \ \dots, \ a_{1000}\]form an arithmetic sequence with common difference 1
The common difference of 1 is added $\frac{1000 - 1}{3} = 333$ times, so $a_{1000} = 2007 + 333 = \boxed{2340}.$
Since $\omega^3 = 1,$ $\frac{2}{\omega} = 2 \omega^2.$  Then multiplying both sides by $(a + \omega)(b + \omega)(c + \omega)(d + \omega),$ we get
\[(b + \omega)(c + \omega)(d + \omega) + (a + \omega)(c + \omega)(d + \omega) + (a + \omega)(b + \omega)(d + \omega) + (a + \omega)(b + \omega)(c + \omega) = 2 \omega^2 (a + \omega)(b + \omega)(c + \omega)(d + \omega).\]Expanding both sides, we get
\begin{align*}
&4 \omega^3 + 3(a + b + c + d) \omega^2 + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) \omega + (abc + abd + acd + bcd) \\
&= 2 \omega^6 + 2(a + b + c + d) \omega^5 + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) \omega^4 + 2(abc + abd + acd + bcd) \omega^3 + 2abcd \omega^2.
\end{align*}Since $\omega^3 = 1,$ this simplifies to
\begin{align*}
&3(a + b + c + d) \omega^2 + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) \omega + (abc + abd + acd + bcd) + 4 \\
&= (2(a + b + c + d) + 2abcd) \omega^2 + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) \omega + 2(abc + abd + acd + bcd) + 2.
\end{align*}Then
\[(a + b + c + d - 2abcd) \omega^2 - abc - abd - acd - bcd + 2 = 0.\]Since $\omega^2$ is nonreal, we must have $a + b + c + d =  2abcd.$  Then $abc + abd + acd + bcd = 2.$
Hence,
\begin{align*}
&\frac{1}{a + 1} + \frac{1}{b + 1} + \frac{1}{c +1} + \frac{1}{d + 1} \\
&= \frac{(b + 1)(c + 1)(d + 1) + (a + 1)(c + 1)(d + 1) + (a + 1)(b + 1)(d + 1) + (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1)}{(a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1)(d + 1)} \\
&= \frac{(abc + abd + acd + bcd) + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) + 3(a + b + c + d) + 4}{abcd + (abc + abd + acd + bcd) + (ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) + (a + b + c + d) + 1} \\
&= \frac{2 + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) + 6abcd + 4}{abcd + 2 + (ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) + 2abcd + 1} \\
&= \frac{6abcd + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) + 6}{3abcd + (ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) + 3} \\
&= \boxed{2}.
\end{align*}
If the graph of $f(x)$ is continuous, the two pieces of the function must meet at $x=n$
In order for this to happen, we know that $n^2+2=2n+5$
Moving all the terms to one side, we are left with the quadratic $n^2-2n-3=0$
Vieta's formulas tell us that the sum of the roots of a quadratic in the form of $ax^2+bx+c$ is just $-\frac{b}{a}$
Since the roots of this quadratic are the only possible values of $n$, our final answer is $-\frac{2}{1}=\boxed{2}$.
By the Remainder Theorem, $p(1) = -1,$ $p(2) = 3,$ and $p(-3) = 4.$
When $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 3),$ the remainder is of the form $ax^2 + bx + c.$  Thus,
\[p(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 3) q(x) + ax^2 + bx + c\]for some polynomial $q(x).$  Setting $x = 1,$ $x = 2,$ and $x = -3,$ we get
\begin{align*}
a + b + c &= p(1) = -1, \\
4a + 2b + c &= p(2) = 3, \\
9a - 3b + c &= p(-3) = 4.
\end{align*}Subtracting these equations in pairs, we get
\begin{align*}
3a + b &= 4, \\
5a - 5b &= 1.
\end{align*}Solving, we find $a = \frac{21}{20}$ and $b = \frac{17}{20}.$  Then $c = -\frac{29}{10},$ so
\[r(x) = \frac{21}{20} x^2 + \frac{17}{20} x - \frac{29}{10}.\]Thus, $r(6) = \frac{21}{20} \cdot 6^2 + \frac{17}{20} \cdot 6 - \frac{29}{10} = \boxed{40}.$
Putting everything over a common denominator, we get
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)} + \frac{1}{(1 + x)(1 + y)(1 + z)} &= \frac{(1 + x)(1 + y)(1 + z) + (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)}{(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)(1 + x)(1 + y)(1 + z)} \\
&= \frac{2 + 2(xy + xz + yz)}{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)(1 - z^2)}.
\end{align*}Note that $2 + 2(xy + xz + yz) \ge 2$ and $(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)(1 - z^2) \le 1,$ so
\[\frac{2 + 2(xy + xz + yz)}{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)(1 - z^2)} \ge 2.\]Equality occurs when $x = y = z = 0,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{2}.$
Dividing by $36,$ we have the standard form of the ellipse: \[\frac{(x-1)^2}{2^2} + \frac{y^2}{6^2} = 1.\]Therefore, the distance from the center of the ellipse to $A$ is $6,$ and the distance from the center of the ellipse to $B$ is $2.$ Since the major and minor axes are perpendicular, by the Pythagorean theorem, \[AB = \sqrt{6^2 + 2^2} = \boxed{ 2\sqrt{10} }.\]
Setting $y = 3$ and $x = 15,$ we get
\[15f(3) = 3f(15) = 60,\]so $f(3) = \boxed{4}.$
Writing the equation as a quadratic in $a,$ we get
\[a^2 - (x^2 + 2x) a + (x^3 - 1) = a^2 - (x^2 + 2x) a + (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0.\]We can then factor this as
\[(a - (x - 1))(a - (x^2 + x + 1)) = 0.\]So, one root in $x$ is $x = a + 1.$  We want the values of $a$ so that
\[x^2 + x + 1 - a = 0\]has no real root
In other words, we want the discriminant to be negative
This gives us $1 - 4(1 - a) < 0,$ or $a < \frac{3}{4}.$
Thus, the solution is $a \in \boxed{\left( -\infty, \frac{3}{4} \right)}.$
Since $P(0) = k,$ the polynomial $P(x)$ is of the form
\[P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + k.\]Since $P(1) = 2k,$
\[a + b + c + k = 2k,\]so $a + b + c = k.$
Since $P(-1) = 3k,$
\[-a + b - c + k = 3k,\]so $-a + b - c = 2k.$   Adding the equations $a + b + c = k$ and $-a + b - c = 2k,$ we get $2b = 3k,$ so $b = \frac{3}{2} k.$
\begin{align*}
P(2) + P(-2) &= (8a + 4b + 2c + k) + (-8a + 4b - 2c + k) \\
&= 8b + 2k = 12k + 2k = \boxed{14k}.
\end{align*}
Since $|a| = 1,$ $a \overline{a} = |a|^2,$ so $\overline{a} = \frac{1}{a}.$  Similarly, $\overline{b} = \frac{1}{b}$ and $\overline{c} = \frac{1}{c}.$
Also, let $z = a + b + c.$  Then
\begin{align*}
|z|^2 &= |a + b + c|^2 \\
&= (a + b + c)(\overline{a + b + c}) \\
&= (a + b + c)(\overline{a} + \overline{b} + \overline{c}) \\
&= (a + b + c) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \right) \\
&= (a + b + c) \cdot \frac{ab + ac + bc}{abc} \\
&= \frac{a^2 b + ab^2 + a^2 c + ac^2 + b^2 c + bc^2 + 3abc}{abc}.
\end{align*}We have that
\[z^3 = (a + b + c)^3 = (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 3(a^2 b + ab^2 + a^2 c + ac^2 + b^2 c + bc^2) + 6abc,\]so
\begin{align*}
3|z|^2 &= \frac{3(a^2 b + ab^2 + a^2 c + ac^2 + b^2 c + bc^2) + 3abc}{abc} \\
&= \frac{z^3 - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 3abc}{abc}.
\end{align*}From the equation $\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ac} + \frac{c^2}{ab} = -1,$ $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = -abc,$ so
\[3|z|^2 = \frac{z^3 + 4abc}{abc} = \frac{z^3}{abc} + 4.\]Then
\[3|z|^2 - 4 = \frac{z^3}{abc},\]so
\[\left| 3|z|^2 - 4 \right| = \left| \frac{z^3}{abc} \right| = |z|^3.\]Let $r = |z|,$ so $|3r^2 - 4| = r^3.$  If $3r^2 - 4 < 0,$ then
\[4 - 3r^2 = r^3.\]This becomes $r^3 + 3r^2 - 4 = 0,$ which factors as $(r - 1)(r + 2)^2 = 0.$  Since $r$ must be nonnegative, $r = 1.$
If $3r^2 - 4 \ge 0,$ then
\[3r^2 - 4 = r^3.\]This becomes $r^3 - 3r^2 + 4 = 0,$ which factors as $(r + 1)(r - 2)^2 = 0.$  Since $r$ must be nonnegtaive, $r = 2.$
Finally, we must show that for each of these potential values of $r,$ there exist corresponding complex numbers $a,$ $b,$ and $c.$
If $a = b = 1$ and $c = -1,$ then $\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ac} + \frac{c^2}{ab} = -1,$ and
\[|a + b + c| = |1| = 1.\]If $a = 1,$ $b = \frac{1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2},$ and $c = \frac{1 - i \sqrt{3}}{2},$ then $\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ac} + \frac{c^2}{ab} = -1,$ and
\[|a + b + c| = |2| = 2.\]Therefore, the possible values of $|a + b + c|$ are $\boxed{1,2}.$
We know that $f^{-1}(u)=v$ is the same as $u=f(v)$
Therefore $f^{-1}(g(x))=x^3-1$ is the same as  \[g(x)=f(x^3-1).\]We can also use that $g(s)=t$ is equivalent to $s=g^{-1}(t)$ to say \[x=g^{-1}(f(x^3-1)).\]This gives an expression containing $g^{-1}\circ f$.
Therefore, $g^{-1}(f(7))$ is the value of $x$ such that $x^3 - 1 = 7$
Solving for $x$, we find $x = \boxed{2}$.
We start by trying to express $z$ in a more convenient form.
We are given that $ z + z^{-1} = \sqrt{3} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 \cos{\frac{\pi}{6}}$
So we know that $z$ is $\text{cis}{\frac{\pi}{6}}$ or $\text{cis}{-\frac{\pi}{6}}$
Say that $z = \text{cis}{\frac{\pi}{6}}$
$$z^{2010} = \left(\text{cis}{\frac{\pi}{6}}\right)^{2010} = \text{cis}{\frac{2010\pi}{6}} = \text{cis}335\pi = \text{cis}\pi = -1.$$Then $z^{-1} = -1^{-1} = -1$
$$z^{2010} + z^{-2010} = -1 + (-1) = \boxed{-2}.$$Similarly, if $z = \text{cis}{-\frac{\pi}{6}}$
$$z^{2010} = \left(\text{cis}{-\frac{\pi}{6}}\right)^{2010} = \text{cis}{-\frac{2010\pi}{6}} = \text{cis}-335\pi = \text{cis}-\pi = -1.$$Then $z^{-1} = -1^{-1} = -1$
$$z^{2010} + z^{-2010} = -1 + (-1) = \boxed{-2}.$$
Arrange the five numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in a circle, in some order
We can place the 5 at the top; let the other numbers be $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d.$  Then the sum we are interested in is the sum of the product of adjacent pairs.
unitsize(1 cm);
label("$5$", dir(90), fontsize(18));
label("$a$", dir(90 - 360/5), fontsize(18));
label("$b$", dir(90 - 2*360/5), fontsize(18));
label("$c$", dir(90 - 3*360/5), fontsize(18));
label("$d$", dir(90 - 4*360/5), fontsize(18));
[/asy]
Assume that the numbers have been arranged so that the sum we are interested in has been maximized
The sum for this arrangement is $5a + ab + bc + cd + 5d.$  This means that if we were to change the arrangement, the sum must either stay the same or decrease.
Suppose we swap 5 and $a$:
unitsize(1 cm);
label("$a$", dir(90), fontsize(18));
label("$5$", dir(90 - 360/5), fontsize(18));
label("$b$", dir(90 - 2*360/5), fontsize(18));
label("$c$", dir(90 - 3*360/5), fontsize(18));
label("$d$", dir(90 - 4*360/5), fontsize(18));
[/asy]
The sum is now $5a + 5b + bc + cd + ad.$  Hence,
\[5a + 5b + bc + cd + ad \le 5a + ab + bc + cd + 5d.\]This reduces to $ab - ad + 5d - 5b \ge 0,$ which factors as $(5 - a)(d - b) \ge 0.$  We know $5 - a \ge 0,$ so $d - b \ge 0.$  And since $b$ and $d$ are distinct, $d > b.$
Now, suppose we swap 5 and $d$:
unitsize(1 cm);
label("$d$", dir(90), fontsize(18));
label("$a$", dir(90 - 360/5), fontsize(18));
label("$b$", dir(90 - 2*360/5), fontsize(18));
label("$c$", dir(90 - 3*360/5), fontsize(18));
label("$5$", dir(90 - 4*360/5), fontsize(18));
[/asy]
The sum is now $ad + ab + bc + 5c + 5d.$  Hence,
\[ad + ab + bc + 5c + 5d \le 5a + ab + bc + cd + 5d.\]This reduces to $cd - ad + 5a - 5c \ge 0,$ which factors as $(5 - d)(a - c) \ge 0.$  We know $5 - d \ge 0,$ so $a - c \ge 0.$  And since $a$ and $c$ are distinct, $a > c.$
Finally, by reflecting the diagram along the vertical axis, we can assume that $b > c.$  This leaves three cases to check:
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}
a & b & c & d & 5a + ab + bc + cd + 5d \\ \hline
2 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 43 \\
3 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 47 \\
4 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 48
\end{array}
\]Hence, the largest possible sum is 48
Furthermore, there are ten permutations that work: The five cyclic permutations of $(5,4,2,1,3),$ and the five cyclic permutations of its reverse, namely $(5,3,1,2,4).$  Thus, $M + N = 48 + 10 = \boxed{58}.$
Let $K$ be the area of the triangle, and let $p$ be the semi-perimeter
Then by Heron's formula,
\[K^2 = p(p - r)(p - s)(p - t).\]By Vieta's formulas, $r + s + t = 4,$ so $p = 2.$  Also, since $r,$ $s,$ $t$ are the roots of $x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - \frac{19}{10},$
\[x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - \frac{19}{10} = (x - r)(x - s)(x - t).\]Setting $x = 2,$ we get
\[(2 - r)(2 - s)(2 - t) = \frac{1}{10}.\]Then
\[K^2 = 2(2 - r)(2 - s)(2 - t) = \frac{1}{5},\]so $K = \sqrt{\frac{1}{5}} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}}.$
The first few terms are
\begin{align*}
z_2 &= 0^2 + i = i, \\
z_3 &= i^2 + i = -1 + i, \\
z_4 &= (-1 + i)^2 + i = -i, \\
z_5 &= (-i)^2 + i = -1 + i.
\end{align*}Since $z_4 = z_2,$ and each term depends only on the previous term, the sequence from here on is periodic, with a period of length 2
Hence, $|z_{111}| = |z_3| = |-1 + i| = \boxed{\sqrt{2}}.$
We can count that there are 49 factors in the given product
For $n < 1,$ all the factors are negative, so the product is negative.
Then for $1 < n < 3,$ the factor $n - 1$ changes sign, and the product becomes positive
For $3 < n < 5,$ the product changes sign again, and the product becomes negative, so the inequality holds for $n = 4.$
Continuing in this way, we see that the inequality holds for $n = 4,$ 8, 16, $\dots,$ 96
For $n > 97,$ all the factors are positive, so the total number of such integers is $\boxed{24}.$
Note that for a fixed value of $p,$ $F(p,q)$ is linear in $q,$ which means that $F(p,q)$ attains its maximum value either at $q = 0$ or $q = 1.$  We compute that $F(p,0) = 7p - 4$ and $F(p,1) = 3 - 5p.$  Hence,
\[G(p) = \max(7p - 4,3 - 5p).\]Note that $7p - 4 = 3 - 5p$ when $p = \frac{7}{12}.$  Then $G(p) = 3 - 5p$ for $p < \frac{7}{12},$ so $G(p)$ is decreasing on this interval
Also, $G(p) = 7p - 4$ for $p > \frac{7}{12},$ so $G(p)$ is increasing on this interval
Therefore, $G(p)$ is minimized for $p = \boxed{\frac{7}{12}}.$
By the Integer Root Theorem, $-2,$ $5,$ and $9$ must all divide $e,$ so $e$ must be at least 90
The polynomial
\[(x + 2)(x - 5)(x - 9)(3x + 1) = 3x^4 - 35x^3 + 39x^2 + 287x + 90\]satisfies the given conditions, so the smallest possible value of $e$ is $\boxed{90}.$
We graph the points $(a,b)$ that satisfy each inequality
The graph of $a^2 + b^2 < 16$ is the set of points inside the circle centered at the origin with radius 4.
From $a^2 + b^2 < 8a,$
\[(a - 4)^2 + b^2 < 16.\]This represents the inside of the circle centered at $(4,0)$ with radius 4.
From $a^2 + b^2 < 8b,$
\[a^2 + (b - 4)^2 < 16.\]This represents the inside of the circle centered at $(0,4)$ with radius 4.

[/asy]
We see that there are $\boxed{6}$ lattice points that lie inside all three circles.
We have that
\[f(2,1) = \frac{2 \cdot 1 - 2 + 2}{4} = \frac{1}{2},\]and
\[f(2,4) = \frac{2 \cdot 4 - 4 - 2}{-8} = -\frac{1}{4},\]so $f(2,1) + f(4,2) = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}.$
This quartic looks almost like a quadratic
We can turn it into one by making the substitution $y = x^2$, giving us $y^2 - 25y + 144 = 0$
We can factor this as $(y - 16)(y - 9) = 0$ to find that $y = 9$ or $y = 16$
We could also have used the quadratic formula to find this.
Now, substituting $x^2$ back for $y$, we see that $x^2 = 9$ or $x^2 = 16$
It follows that the possible values for $x$ are $-3, 3, -4, 4$
Adding all of these values together, we find that the sum of all solutions is $\boxed{0}$.
The center of the hyperbola is $(h,k) = (2,0).$  The distance between the center and one vertex is $a = 3,$ and the distance between the center and one focus is $c = 6.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 6^2 - 3^2 = 27,$ so $b = 3 \sqrt{3}.$
Therefore, $h + k + a + b = 2 + 0 + 3 + 3 \sqrt{3} = \boxed{3 \sqrt{3} + 5}.$
Note that $(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)$ is a factor of $(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1) = x^4 - 1.$  Since
\[x^{1000} - 1 = (x^4 - 1)(x^{996} + x^{992} + x^{988} + \dots + x^8 + x^4 + 1),\]the remainder when $x^{1000}$ is divided by $(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)$ is $\boxed{1}.$
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\left( 1 + \frac{2}{3} \right) \left( \sin^4 x + \frac{3}{2} \cos^4 x \right) \ge (\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x)^2 = 1,\]so
\[\sin^4 x + \frac{3}{2} \cos^4 x \ge \frac{3}{5}.\]Equality occurs when
\[\sin^4 x = \frac{9}{4} \cos^4 x,\]or $\tan^4 x = \frac{9}{4}.$  Thus, equality occurs for $x = \arctan \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}.$  Hence, the minimum value is $\boxed{\frac{3}{5}}.$
Note that $xz + 2yz + 3zv + 7zw = z(x + 2y + 3v + 7w).$  By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\begin{align*}
x + 2y + 3v + 7w &\le \sqrt{(1 + 4 + 9 + 49)(x^2 + y^2 + v^2 + w^2)} \\
&= \sqrt{63 (x^2 + y^2 + v^2 + w^2)} \\
&= 3 \sqrt{7(2016 - z^2)},
\end{align*}so $z(x + 2y + 3v + 7w) \le 3z \sqrt{7(2016 - z^2)} = 3 \sqrt{7z^2 (2016 - z^2)}.$
By AM-GM,
\[z^2 (2016 - z^2) \le \left( \frac{z^2 + (2016 - z^2)}{2} \right)^2 = 1008^2,\]so
\[3 \sqrt{7z^2 (2016 - z^2)} \le 3 \sqrt{7 \cdot 1008^2} = 3024 \sqrt{7}.\]Equality occurs when $x:y:v:w = 1:2:3:7,$ $z^2 = 1008,$ and $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + v^2 + w^2 = 2016,$ which leads to $x = 4,$ $y = 8,$ $z = 12 \sqrt{7},$ $v = 12$, and $w = 28.$  Thus,
\[M + x_M + y_M + z_M + v_M + w_M = 3024 \sqrt{7} + 4 + 8 + 12 \sqrt{7} + 12 + 28 = \boxed{52 + 3036 \sqrt{7}}.\]
Let $a$ and $b$ be the roots of this equation
Then we want
\[|a - b| = a^2 + b^2.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[(a - b)^2 = (a^2 + b^2)^2.\]By Vieta's formulas, $a + b = -\frac{4}{5}$ and $ab = \frac{k}{5}.$  Squaring the equation $a + b = -\frac{4}{5},$ we get
\[a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = \frac{16}{25}.\]Then
\[(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 4ab = \frac{16}{25} - \frac{4k}{5} = \frac{16 - 20k}{25}.\]Also,
\[a^2 + b^2 = \frac{16}{25} - 2ab = \frac{16}{25} - \frac{2k}{5} = \frac{16 - 10k}{25}.\]Hence,
\[\frac{16 - 20k}{25} = \left( \frac{16 - 10k}{25} \right)^2.\]This simplifies to $25k^2 + 45k - 36 = 0,$ which factors as $(5k - 3)(5k + 12) = 0.$  Thus, the possible values of $k$ are $\boxed{\frac{3}{5}, -\frac{12}{5}}.$
The given inequality expands as
\[x^2 + y^2 + 1 \ge Cx + Cy.\]Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get
\[\left( x - \frac{C}{2} \right)^2 + \left( y - \frac{C}{2} \right)^2 + 1 - \frac{C^2}{2} \ge 0.\]This inequality holds for all $x$ and $y$ if and only if $1 - \frac{C^2}{2} \ge 0,$ or $C^2 \le 2.$  Thus, the largest possible value of $C$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{2}}.$
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$
We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$
The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\]
Let $f(x)$ be the polynomial of degree $13$ and let $q(x)$ be the quotient when $f(x)$ is divided by $d(x)$
Let $r(x) = 3x^3+4x^2-x+12$
Then we have
$$f(x) = d(x)\cdot q(x) + r(x).$$where $\deg q = 7$.
Since $\deg r = 3$, we need to have $\deg(d\cdot q) = \deg f$ which means $\deg d + \deg q = \deg f$
So $\deg d = 13-7 = \boxed{6}.$
The domain of the function is the set of all real numbers if and only if the denominator $-5x^2 + 2x + k$ is nonzero for all $x.$  In other words, the quadratic
\[-5x^2 + 2x + k = 0\]should not have any real solutions
This means that the discriminant is negative, i.e.
\[4 - 4(-5)(k) = 4 + 20k < 0.\]Solving, we find $k < -\frac{1}{5}.$  Therefore, the set of all possible $k$ is $\boxed{\left( -\infty, -\frac{1}{5} \right)}.$
Since the given function has vertical asymptotes at $2$ and $-2$, we know that $q(2) = q(-2) = 0$ (i.e
$2$ and $-2$ are roots of $q(x)$)
Moreover, since the given function has no horizontal asymptote, we know that the degree of $q(x)$ must be less than the degree of the numerator, which is $3$.
Hence, $q(x)$ is a quadratic with roots $2$ and $-2$
In other words, we can write it as $q(x) = a(x+2)(x-2)$ for some constant $a$
Since $q(3) = 15$, we have $a(3+2)(3-2) = 15$.
Solving for $a$ gives $a = 15/5 = 3$
Hence $q(x) = 3(x-2)(x+2) = \boxed{3x^2 - 12}$.
Squaring the equation $|2z - w| = 25$, we get $|2z - w|^2 = 625$
Since $k \cdot \overline{k} = |k|^2$ for all complex numbers $k$, we have that
\[(2z - w)(2 \overline{z} - \overline{w}) = 625.\]Expanding, we get
\[4z \overline{z} - 2(w \overline{z} + \overline{w} z) + w \overline{w} = 625.\]Similarly, from the equation $|z + 2w| = 5$, we get
\[(z + 2w)(\overline{z} + 2 \overline{w}) = 25.\]Expanding, we get
\[z \overline{z} + 2(w \overline{z} + \overline{w} z) + 4w \overline{w} = 25.\]Finally, from the equation $|z + w| = 2$, we get
\[(z + w)(\overline{z} + \overline{w}) = 4.\]Expanding, we get
\[z \overline{z} + (w \overline{z} + \overline{w} z) + w \overline{w} = 4.\]We then have the equations
\begin{align*}
4z \overline{z} - 2(w \overline{z} + \overline{w} z) + w \overline{w} &= 625, \\
z \overline{z} + 2(w \overline{z} + \overline{w} z) + 4w \overline{w} &= 25, \\
z \overline{z} + (w \overline{z} + \overline{w} z) + w \overline{w} &= 4.
\end{align*}Let $a = z \overline{z}$, $b = w \overline{z} + \overline{w} z$, and $c = w \overline{w}$
Then our equations become
\begin{align*}
4a - 2b + c &= 625, \\
a + 2b + 4c &= 25, \\
a + b + c &= 4.
\end{align*}Adding the first two equations, we get $5a + 5c = 650$, so $a + c = 130$
Substituting into the equation $a + b + c = 4$, we get $b + 130 = 4$, so $b = -126$.
Substituting this value of $b$ into the first two equations, we get $4a + 252 + c = 625$ and $a - 252 + 4c = 25$, so
\begin{align*}
4a + c &= 373, \\
a + 4c &= 277.
\end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by 4, we get $16a + 4c = 1492.$  Subtracting the equation $a + 4c = 277,$ we get $15a = 1215$, so $a = 81$.
But $a = z \overline{z} = |z|^2$, so $|z| = \boxed{9}$.
Observe that  \begin{align*}
p(0,0) &= a_0 = 0\\
p(1,0) &= a_0 + a_1 + a_3 + a_6 = a_1 + a_3 + a_6 = 0\\
p(-1,0) &= -a_1 + a_3 - a_6 = 0.
\end{align*}Adding the above two equations gives $a_3 = 0$, and so we can deduce that $a_6 = -a_1$
Similarly, plugging in $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$ gives $a_5 = 0$ and $a_9 = -a_2$
Now, \begin{align*}
p(1,1) &= a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9\\
&= 0 + a_1 + a_2 + 0 + a_4 + 0 - a_1 + a_7 + a_8 - a_2 = a_4 + a_7 + a_8 = 0\\
p(1,-1) &= a_0 + a_1 - a_2 + 0 - a_4 + 0 - a_1 - a_7 + a_8 + a_2\\ &= -a_4 - a_7 + a_8 = 0
\end{align*}Therefore, $a_8 = 0$ and $a_7 = -a_4$
Finally, $$p(2,2) = 0 + 2a_1 + 2a_2 + 0 + 4a_4 + 0 - 8a_1 - 8a_4 +0 - 8a_2 = -6 a_1 - 6 a_2 - 4 a_4 = 0.$$Hence, $3a_1 + 3a_2 + 2a_4 = 0$
Now,  \begin{align*}
p(x,y) &= 0 + a_1x + a_2y + 0 + a_4xy + 0 - a_1x^3 - a_4x^2y + 0 - a_2y^3\\
&= a_1 x(1-x)(1+x) + a_2 y(1-y)(1+y) + xy (1-x) a_4 \\
&= a_1 x(1 - x)(1 + x) + a_2 y(1 - y)(1 + y) - \left( \frac{3}{2} a_1 + \frac{3}{2} a_2 \right) xy(1 - x) \\
&= a_1 \left( x - x^3 - \frac{3}{2} xy(1 - x) \right) + a_2 \left( y - y^3 - \frac{3}{2} xy(1 - x) \right).
\end{align*}If $p(r,s) = 0$ for every such polynomial, then
\begin{align*}
r - r^3 - \frac{3}{2} rs (1 - r) &= 0, \\
s - s^3 - \frac{3}{2} rs (1 - r) &= 0.
\end{align*}These factor as
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} r(1 - r)(2r - 3s + 2) &= 0, \\
\frac{1}{2} s(3r^2 - 3r - 2s^2 + 2) &= 0.
\end{align*}Hence, $r = 0,$ $r = 1,$ or $r = \frac{3s - 2}{2}.$
Substituting $r = 0$ into the second equation, we get $s^3 = s,$ so $s = -1,$ 0, or 1.
Substituting $r = 1$ into the second equation, we again get $s^3 = s,$ so $s = -1,$ 0, or 1.
Substituting $r = \frac{3s - 2}{2}$ into the second equation, we get
\[s - s^3 - \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{3s - 2}{2} \cdot s \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{3s - 2}{2} \right) = 0.\]This simplifies to $19s^3 - 54s^2 + 32s = 0,$ which factors as $s(s - 2)(19s - 16) = 0.$  We are looking for a value where $s$ is not an integer, so $s = \frac{16}{19}.$  Then $r = \frac{5}{19},$ so $(r,s) = \boxed{\left( \frac{5}{19}, \frac{16}{19} \right)}.$
This is an instance of a result known as Bezout's Theorem, from algebraic geometry
Loosely speaking, Bezout's Theorem states that if we plot two curves, then the number of intersection points is equal to the product of their degrees
Here, one curve is
\[x(x - 1)(2x - 3y + 2) = 0,\]shown in red below, which consists of three lines
The other curve is
\[y(3x^2 - 3x - 2y^2 + 2) = 0,\]shown in blue below, which consists of a line and a hyperbola
The degree of both curves is 3
Note how the red and blue curves intersect at the eight given points, so by Bezout's Theorem, there is a ninth point of intersection, which is exactly $\left( \frac{5}{19}, \frac{16}{19} \right).$

By the formula for an infinite geometric series, \[S(r) = \frac{12}{1-r}.\]Thus, we are given that \[S(a)S(-a) = \frac{12}{1-a} \cdot \frac{12}{1+a} = \frac{144}{1-a^2} = 2016.\]Instead of solving for $a$ explicitly, we note that \[\begin{aligned} S(a) + S(-a) &= \frac{12}{1-a} + \frac{12}{1+a}\\& = \frac{12(1-a)+12(1+a)}{1-a^2}\\& = \frac{24}{1-a^2}\\& = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{144}{1-a^2} \\&= \frac{1}{6} \cdot 2016\\& = \boxed{336},\end{aligned}\]which is the answer.
Writing the product out, we get
\[\frac{1 \cdot 3}{5^2} \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 4}{6^2} \cdot \frac{3 \cdot 5}{7^2} \dotsm \frac{11 \cdot 13}{15^2} \cdot \frac{12 \cdot 14}{16^2} \cdot \frac{13 \cdot 15}{17^2}.\]The two factors of 5 in the numerators cancel the two factors of 3 in the denominators
The same occurs with the two factors of 6, and so on, up to the two factors of 13
We are left with
\[\frac{2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 4^2}{14 \cdot 15 \cdot 16^2 \cdot 17^2} = \boxed{\frac{3}{161840}}.\]
Let $r$ and $s$ be the integer roots
Then by Vieta's formulas, $r+s=-a$ and $rs=6a.$ Thus, \[rs + 6(r+s) = 0.\]Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we have \[rs + 6(r+s) + 36 = 36 \implies (r+6)(s+6) = 36.\]The number $36 = 2^2 3^2$ has $2(2+1)(2+1) = 18$ factors, both positive and negative; they come in $8$ pairs, with singletons $6$ and $-6.$ However, since the order of $r$ and $s$ does not matter, each pair should only be counted once, so there are $8 + 1 + 1 = \boxed{10}$ possible values for $a.$
\[S = \sum_{i = 1}^k (a_i + b_i).\]Since the $a_i$ and $b_i$ are all distinct,
\[S \ge 1 + 2 + \dots + 2k = \frac{(2k)(2k + 1)}{2} = k(2k + 1).\]Since the $k$ sums $a_1 + b_1,$ $a_2 + b_2,$ $\dots,$ $a_k + b_k$ are all distinct and less than or equal to 2009,
\[S \le (2010 - k) + (2011 - k) + \dots + 2009 = \frac{(4019 - k)(k)}{2}.\]Hence,
\[k(2k + 1) \le \frac{k(4019 - k)}{2}.\]Then
\[2k + 1 \le \frac{4019 - k}{2},\]so $k \le \frac{4017}{5},$ which means $k \le 803.$
The 803 pairs $(1,1207),$ $(2,1208),$ $\dots,$ $(401,1607),$ $(402,805),$ $(403,806),$ $\dots,$ $(803,1206)$ show that $k$ can be 803
Thus, the maximum value of $k$ is $\boxed{803}.$
Note that $x^2+4x+4-81x^4=(x+2)^2-(9x^2)^2=\boxed{(-9x^2+x+2)(9x^2+x+2)}$, where we have used the difference of squares identity to get the second equality.
The distance between the center and the focus $(-3,0)$ is $c = 1.$  Also, the semi-major axis is the distance between the center and the endpoint of the semi-major axis, which is $a = 2.$  Then the semi-minor axis is $b = \sqrt{a^2 - c^2} = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}.$
Since $x^2+4x+3 = (x+1)(x+3)$ has degree $2$, the remainder must be of the form $ax+b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$
Let $q(x)$ be the quotient of the division, so
$$2x^6-x^4+4x^2-7= (x+1)(x+3)q(x)+ax+b.$$Plugging in $x=-1$ gives us:
$$2(-1)^6-(-1)^4+4(-1)^2-7 = 0+a(-1)+b,$$which simplifies to
$$b-a = -2.$$Plugging in $x=-3$ gives us:
$$2(-3)^6-(-3)^4+4(-3)^2-7 = 0+a(-3)+b,$$which simplifies to
$$b-3a = 1406.$$Solving this system of equations gives us $a=-704$ and $b=-706$, and so our remainder is $\boxed{-704x-706}$.
If we let $y=z^2$, then our equation becomes a simple quadratic equation:
$$y^2-4y+3=0.$$Indeed, this equation factors easily as $(y-3)(y-1)=0$, so either $y-3=0$ or $y-1=0$.
We now explore both possibilities.
If $y-3=0$, then $y=3$, so $z^2=3$, so $z=\pm\sqrt 3$.
If $y-1=0$, then $y=1$, so $z^2=1$, so $z=\pm 1$.
Thus we have four solutions to the original equation: $z=\boxed{-\sqrt{3},-1,1,\sqrt{3}}$.
Note that $n^3a_n= 133.\overline{133}_n = a_n + n^2 +
3n + 3$, so $a_n = \frac{n^2+3n+3}{n^3-1} =
\frac{(n+1)^3-1}{n(n^3-1)}.$ Therefore      \begin{align*}
a_4\cdot a_5 \cdots a_{99} &= \frac{5^3 - 1}{4(4^3-1)} \cdot \frac{6^3 - 1}{5(5^3-1)} \cdots \frac{100^3 - 1}{99(99^3-1)} \\
&= \frac{3!}{99!} \cdot \frac{100^3 - 1}{4^3-1} \\
&= \frac{6}{99!} \cdot \frac{99(100^2 + 100 + 1)}{63}\\
&= \frac{(2)(10101)}{(21)(98!)} = \frac{962}{98!}.
\end{align*}Hence, $m=\boxed{962}$.
If the given equation is true, then multiplying by $(x+C)(x+7)$ gives the equation \[(x+B)(Ax+28) = 2(x+C)(x+7),\]which must also be true
(Note however, that the converse does not hold: that is, by multiplying by $(x+C)(x+7),$ we may have introduced extraneous roots.) Therefore, the above equation must also have infinitely many roots for $x.$ That is, the polynomials $(x+B)(Ax+28)$ and $2(x+C)(x+7)$ must agree for infinitely many values of $x.$ This means that they must be identical polynomials
(In general, if $p(x) = q(x)$ for infinitely many $x,$ then $p(x) - q(x) = 0$ has infinitely many roots, which is only possible if $p(x) - q(x)$ is identically the zero polynomial.)
This means that \[(x+B)(Ax+28) = 2(x+C)(x+7)\]for all $x.$ Expanding both sides, we get \[Ax^2 + (AB+28)x + 28B = 2x^2 + (2C+14)x + 14C.\]Corresponding coefficients of both sides must be equal, so we have \[\begin{aligned} A &= 2, \\ AB+28 &= 2C+14, \\ 28B &= 14C
\end{aligned}\]From the first and third equations, $A=2$ and $C=2B.$ Then substituting into the second equation gives \[2B+28 = 4B+14,\]so $B=7,$ and then $C=14.$ This means that our original equation was \[\frac{(x+7)(2x+28)}{(x+14)(x+7)} = 2.\]This equation holds whenever the denominator is nonzero
The denominator is equal to zero when $x=-7$ and $x=-14,$ so the sum of the values of $x$ which are not roots of the original equation is $(-7)+(-14) = \boxed{-21}.$
$$f(-x) = |g((-x)^3)| = |g(-x^3)|$$Since $g$ is odd, $g(-x) = -g(x)$
$$f(-x) = |-g(x^3)| = |g(x^3)| = f(x).$$Hence, $f$ is $\boxed{\text{even}}$.
We have $a_n = \frac{1}{\log_n 2002} = \log_{2002} n$, so \begin{align*}
b-c =& \left(\log_{2002} 2 + \log_{2002}
3 + \log_{2002} 4 + \log_{2002} 5\right)\\
&- \left(\log_{2002} 10 + \log_{2002}
11 + \log_{2002} 12 + \log_{2002} 13 + \log_{2002} 14\right)\\
=& \log_{2002}
\frac{2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5}{10\cdot 11 \cdot 12 \cdot 13 \cdot
14} = \log_{2002} \frac{1}{11 \cdot 13 \cdot 14} = \log_{2002}
\frac{1}{2002} = \boxed{-1}.
\end{align*}
By applying the difference of squares factorization repeatedly, we get
\begin{align*}
x^8 - 1 &= (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1) \\
&= (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 1) \\
&= (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 1).
\end{align*}We can factor $x^4 + 1$ further with a clever application of difference-of-squares:
\begin{align*}
x^4 + 1 &= x^4 + 2x^2 + 1 - 2x^2 \\
&= (x^2 + 1)^2 - (x \sqrt{2})^2 \\
&= (x^2 + x \sqrt{2} + 1)(x^2 - x \sqrt{2} + 1).
\end{align*}Thus,
\[x^8 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + x \sqrt{2} + 1)(x^2 - x \sqrt{2} + 1).\]The quadratic factors have no real roots, so the factorization can have at most $\boxed{5}$ factors.
The $y$-intercept of the graph is the point at which $x=0$
At that point, $P(x)=c$, which we are told is equal to 8
Thus, $c=8$
The product of the roots of the given polynomial is $-\frac{c}{2}=-4$
The problem states that the mean of the zeros must also equal $-4$, so the sum of the three zeros (this is a cubic equation) is equal to $3 \cdot -4 = -12$
The sum of the zeros is also equal to $-\frac{a}{2}$, so $a=24$
Finally, we are given that the sum of the coefficients, or $2+ a+b+c$, is also equal to $-4$
Plugging in our known values of $a$ and $c$, we have $2+24+b+8=-4$
Solving for $b$, we get $b=\boxed{-38}$.
We have \begin{align*} 7^{x+7} &= 8^x \\
7^x\cdot 7^7 &= 8^x \\
\left(\frac{8}{7}\right)^x &= 7^7 \\
x &= \log_{8/7}7^7 \end{align*}Since we are looking for the base of the logarithm, our answer is $\boxed{\frac{8}{7}}$.
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin
Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).
Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$
Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).
There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line
However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$
Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin
This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.
In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point
This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$.
Let $y$ be a number in the range of $g.$ This means that there is a real number $t$ such that \[y = \frac{t^2+\tfrac34 t}{t^2+1}.\]Multiplying both sides by $t^2+1$ and rearranging, we get the equation \[(y-1)t^2 - \tfrac34 t + y = 0.\]Since $t^2+1 \neq 0$ for all $t,$ our steps are reversible, so $y$ is in the range of $g$ if and only if this equation has a real solution for $t.$ In turn, this equation has a real solution for $t$ if and only if the discriminant of this quadratic is nonnegative
Therefore, the range of $g$ consists exactly of the values of $y$ which satisfy \[\left(\tfrac34\right)^2 - 4(y-1)y \ge 0,\]or \[0 \ge 64y^2 -64y -9.\]This quadratic factors as \[0 \ge (8y-9)(8y+1),\]which means that the solutions to the inequality are given by $-\tfrac18 \le y \le \tfrac98.$ Therefore, the range of $g$ is the closed interval $\boxed{[-\tfrac18, \tfrac98]}.$
First, we claim there exist positive real numbers $x$ and $y$ so that $x - y = xy = 2009.$  From these equations,
\[x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 2009^2,\]so $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 2009^2 + 4 \cdot 2009.$  Then $x + y = \sqrt{2009^2 + 4 \cdot 2009},$ so by Vieta's formulas, $x$ and $y$ are the roots of
\[t^2 - (\sqrt{2009^2 + 4 \cdot 2009}) t + 2009 = 0.\](The discriminant of this quadratic is $2009^2,$ so it does have real roots.)
Then for these values of $x$ and $y,$
\[f(2009) = \sqrt{f(2009) + 2}.\]Let $a = f(2009),$ so $a = \sqrt{a + 2}.$  Squaring both sides, we get $a^2 = a + 2,$ so $a^2 - a - 2 = 0.$  This factors as $(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0.$  Since $a$ is positive, $a = \boxed{2}.$
To compare different values of $A_k,$ we look at the ratio $A_k/A_{k-1},$ which equals \[\frac{A_k}{A_{k-1}} = \frac{\binom{1000}{k} (0.2)^k}{\binom{1000}{k-1} (0.2)^{k-1}} = \frac{\frac{1000!}{k!(1000-k)!} (0.2)^k}{\frac{1000!}{(k-1)!(1001-k)!} (0.2)^{k-1}} = \frac{1001-k}{5k}.\]The inequality \[\frac{A_k}{A_{k-1}} = \frac{1001-k}{5k} > 1\]holds if and only if $k < \tfrac{1001}{6} = 166.8\overline{3},$ that is, if $k \le 166.$ Therefore, $A_k > A_{k-1}$ holds when $k \le 166,$ and $A_k < A_{k-1}$ holds when $k \ge 167.$ Thus, \[A_{166} > A_{165} > \dots > A_1\]and \[A_{1000} < A_{999} < \dots < A_{166},\]which means that $A_k$ is largest for $k=\boxed{166}.$
First,
\[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1} = \frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{(\sqrt{2} + 1)(\sqrt{2} - 1)} = \frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{2 - 1} = \sqrt{2} - 1.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
\frac{(\sqrt{2} - 1)^{1 - \sqrt{3}}}{(\sqrt{2} + 1)^{1 + \sqrt{3}}} &= (\sqrt{2} - 1)^{1 - \sqrt{3}} (\sqrt{2} - 1)^{1 + \sqrt{3}} \\
&= (\sqrt{2} - 1)^2 \\
&= 2 - 2 \sqrt{2} + 1 \\
&= \boxed{3 - 2 \sqrt{2}}.
\end{align*}
Adding $\sqrt{25-x^2}$ to both sides gives \[\sqrt{49-x^2} = 3 + \sqrt{25-x^2}.\]Then, squaring both sides, we get \[49-x^2 = 9 + 6\sqrt{25-x^2} + (25-x^2),\]so \[15 = 6\sqrt{25-x^2}.\]Thus, $\sqrt{25-x^2} = \frac{15}{6} = \frac{5}{2}.$ Instead of solving for $x$ from here, we notice that \[\sqrt{49-x^2} = 3 + \sqrt{25-x^2} = 3 + \frac{5}{2} = \frac{11}{2}.\]Thus, \[\sqrt{49-x^2} + \sqrt{25-x^2} = \frac{11}{2} + \frac{5}{2} = \boxed{8}.\]
In general, when a polynomial is divided by a polynomial of degree $d,$ then the possible degrees of the remainder are 0, 1, 2, $\dots,$ $d - 1.$  Therefore, the possible degrees of the remainder here are $\boxed{0,1,2,3,4}.$
Combining the fractions, we get
\[\frac{2x + 16}{(x + 9)(x + 7)} = \frac{2x + 16}{(x + 10)(x + 6)}.\]Hence,
\[(2x + 16)(x + 10)(x + 6) = (2x + 16)(x + 9)(x + 7),\]so
\[2(x + 8)[(x + 10)(x + 6) - (x + 9)(x + 7)] = 2(x + 8)(-3) = 0.\]Thus, $x = \boxed{-8}.$
Setting $x = 0,$ we get
\[f(y + f(0)) = f(y) + 1\]for all real numbers $y.$
Setting $y = f(0),$ we get
\[f(f(x) + f(0)) = f(x + f(0)) + xf(f(0)) - xf(0) - x + 1\]for all real numbers $x.$  Since $f(f(x) + f(0)) = f(f(x)) + 1,$ $f(x + f(0)) = f(x) + 1,$ and $f(f(0)) = f(0) + 1,$
\[f(f(x)) + 1 = f(x) + 1 + x(f(0) + 1) - xf(0) - x + 1.\]This simplifies to
\[f(f(x)) = f(x) + 1.\]Setting $y = 0,$ we get
\[f(f(x)) = f(x) + xf(0) - x + 1.\]But $f(f(x)) = f(x) + 1,$ so $xf(0) - x = 0$ for all $x.$  This means $f(0) = 1.$  Hence,
\[f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1\]for all $x.$
Replacing $x$ with $x + 1,$ we get
\[f(f(x + 1) + y) = f(x + y + 1) + (x + 1) f(y) - (x + 1) y - x + 1.\]Since $f(f(x + 1) + y) = f(f(x) + y + 1) = f(f(x) + y) + 1$ and $f(x + y + 1) = f(x + y),$ we can write this as
\[f(f(x) + y) + 1 = f(x + y) + 1 + (x + 1) f(y) - (x + 1) y - x + 1.\]Subtracting $f(f(x) + y) = f(x + y) + xf(y) - xy - x + 1,$ we get
\[1 = f(y) - y,\]so $f(x) = x + 1$ for all $x.$  We can check that this function works.
Therefore, $n = 1$ and $s = 2,$ so $n \times s = \boxed{2}.$
We can write
\[f(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2) \dotsm (x - r_{2017})\]and
\[P(z) = k \prod_{j = 1}^{2007} \left( z - \left( r_j + \frac{1}{r_j} \right) \right)\]for some nonzero constant $k.$
We want to compute
\[\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \frac{\prod_{j = 1}^{2007} \left( 1 - \left( r_j + \frac{1}{r_j} \right) \right)}{\prod_{j = 1}^{2007} \left( -1 - \left( r_j + \frac{1}{r_j} \right) \right)} = \frac{\prod_{j = 1}^{2007} (r_j^2 - r_j + 1)}{\prod_{j = 1}^{2007} (r_j^2 + r_j + 1)}.\]Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be the roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0,$ so
\[x^2 + x + 1 = (x - \alpha)(x - \beta).\]Then
\[x^2 - x + 1 = (x + \alpha)(x + \beta).\]Also, $(\alpha - 1)(\alpha^2 + \alpha + 1) = \alpha^3 - 1 = 0,$ so $\alpha^3 = 1.$  Similarly, $\beta^3 = 1.$  Thus,
\begin{align*}
\prod_{j = 1}^{2007} (r_j^2 - r_j + 1) &= \prod_{j = 1}^{2007} (r_j + \alpha)(r_j + \beta) \\
&= \prod_{j = 1}^{2007} (-\alpha - r_j)(-\beta - r_j) \\
&= f(-\alpha) f(-\beta) \\
&= (-\alpha^{2007} + 17 \alpha^{2006} + 1)(-\beta^{2007} + 17 \beta^{2006} + 1) \\
&= (17 \alpha^2)(17 \beta^2) \\
&= 289.
\end{align*}Similarly,
\begin{align*}
\prod_{j = 1}^{2007} (r_j^2 + r_j + 1) &= \prod_{j = 1}^{2007} (r_j - \alpha)(r_j - \beta) \\
&= \prod_{j = 1}^{2007} (\alpha - r_j)(\beta - r_j) \\
&= f(\alpha) f(\beta) \\
&= (\alpha^{2007} + 17 \alpha^{2006} + 1)(\beta^{2007} + 17 \beta^{2006} + 1) \\
&= (17 \alpha^2 + 2)(17 \beta^2 + 2) \\
&= 289 \alpha^2 \beta^2 + 34 \alpha^2 + 34 \beta^2 + 4 \\
&= 259.
\end{align*}Therefore,
\[\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \boxed{\frac{289}{259}}.\]
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} &= \frac{1}{3x} + \frac{1}{3x} + \frac{1}{3x} + \frac{1}{2y} + \frac{1}{2y} + \frac{1}{z} \\
&\ge 6 \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{3x} \cdot \frac{1}{3x} \cdot \frac{1}{3x} \cdot \frac{1}{2y} \cdot \frac{1}{2y} \cdot \frac{1}{z}} \\
&= 6 \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{108x^3 y^2 z}}.
\end{align*}Since $\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} = 6,$ this gives us
\[x^3 y^2 z \ge \frac{1}{108}.\]Equality occurs when $3x = 2y = z.$  Along with the condition $\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} = 6,$ we can solve to get $x = \frac{1}{3},$ $y = \frac{1}{2},$ and $z = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{\frac{1}{108}}.$
By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root $p/q$ of $g(x)$ must have $p$ divide $4$ and $q$ divide 1
In particular, this means any rational root must be an integer divisor of 4.
By trying out the integer factors of 4, we find that $g(2) = 8-9\cdot4+16\cdot2-4=0$
Hence by the Factor theorem, $x-2$ is a factor of $g(x)$
With polynomial division, we can write $g(x) = (x-2)(x^2-7x+2).$ We can find the remaining roots of $g(x)$ by finding the roots of $x^2-7x+2$ using the quadratic formula
This gives us
\[x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49-8} }{2} =\frac{7 \pm \sqrt{41} }{2} .\]Since these are definitely not rational, the sum of the rational roots of $g(x)$ is $\boxed{2}.$
Denote the first three terms by $a,$ $a+d,$ and $a+2d,$ where $a$ and $d$ are positive integers; then the fourth term is $a+30.$ Since the last three terms form an arithmetic sequence, we have \[(a+d)(a+30) = (a+2d)^2,\]or \[a^2 + (30+d) a + 30d = a^2 + 4ad + 4d^2.\]Solving for $a,$ we get \[a = \frac{4d^2-30d}{30-3d} = \frac{2d(2d-15)}{3(10-d)}.\]Since $a$ is positive, we must have $f(d) = \frac{d(2d-15)}{10-d} > 0.$ We construct a sign table for this expression: \begin{tabular}{c|ccc|c} &$d$ &$2d-15$ &$-d+10$ &$f(d)$ \\ \hline$d<0$ &$-$&$-$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$0<d<\frac{15}{2}$ &$+$&$-$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$\frac{15}{2}<d<10$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$d>10$ &$+$&$+$&$-$&$-$\\ [.1cm]\end{tabular}Since $d > 0,$ we must have $\tfrac{15}{2} < d < 10,$ which only gives two possible integer values for $d,$ namely $8$ and $9.$ For $d=8,$ we get \[a = \frac{2 \cdot 8 \cdot 1}{3 \cdot 2} = \frac{8}{3},\]which is not an integer, so we must have $d=9$ and \[a = \frac{2 \cdot 9 \cdot 3}{3 \cdot 1} = 18.\]Then the sum of the four terms is \[a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+30) = 18 + 27 + 36 + 48 = \boxed{129}.\]
If $a_1$ is even, then $a_2 = \frac{a_1}{2} < a_1,$ so $a_1$ does not have the given property.
If $a_1$ is of the form $4k + 1,$ then $a_2 = 3(4k + 1) + 1 = 12k + 4,$ $a_3 = 6k + 2,$ and
\[a_4 = 3k + 1 < a_1,\]so $a_1$ does not have the given property in this case either.
If $a_1$ is of the form $4k + 3,$ then $a_2 = 3(4k + 3) + 1 = 12k + 10,$ $a_3 = 6k + 5,$ and
\[a_4 = 3(6k + 5) + 1 = 18k + 16,\]which are all greater than $a_1,$ so in this case, $a_1$ has the given property.
There are $2008/4 = 502$ numbers less than or equal to 2008 that have the form $4k + 3.$  Thus, the answer is $\boxed{502}.$
In the first equation, adding $(a-13)x$ to both sides gives us $ax+by+cz=(a-13)x$
Solving for $x$, we have $$x = \frac{ax+by+cz}{a-13}.$$Since $ a \ne 13$ and $ x \ne 0$, both sides of the equation are non-zero
Similarly from the 2nd and 3rd equation,
$$ y = \frac{ax+by+cz}{b-23}$$and
$$z = \frac{ax+by+cz}{c-42}.$$Then we know that
$$\begin{aligned} ax+by+cz &= a \cdot  \frac{ax+by+cz}{a-13} + b \cdot \frac{ax+by+cz}{b-23} + c \cdot \frac{ax+by+cz}{c-42}\\
&= (ax+by+cz)\left(\frac{a}{a-13} + \frac{b}{b-23} + \frac{c}{c-42}\right)
\end{aligned} $$If $ax+by+cz = 0 $, then $x = \frac{ax+by+cz}{a-13} = 0$
But we know $x\ne0$
Hence, $ax+by+cz \ne 0 $
$$\frac{a}{a-13} + \frac{b}{b-23} + \frac{c}{c-42} = \boxed{1}.$$
Instead of plugging in $x=7$ into $f(x)$ and solving, we can use the Remainder Theorem to avoid complicated arithmetic
We know that $f(7)$ will be the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $x-7$
So we have:
\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{2x^3} & -3x^2&+5x&+11 \\
\cline{2-6}
x-7 & 2x^4 &- 17x^3 &+ 26x^2&-24x&-60  \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{2x^4} & -14x^3  \\
\cline{2-3}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{0} & -3x^3 & +26x^2   \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} &-3x^3  &+21x^2   \\
\cline{3-4}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 0& 5x^2 & -24x   \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 5x^2 & -35x   \\
\cline{4-5}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 0 & 11x & -60   \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & &  & 11x & -77   \\
\cline{5-6}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & &  & 0 & 17  \\
\end{array}
\]Hence $f(7) = \boxed{17}$.
We have that $a^2 = 18$ and $b^2 = 2,$ so $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 20,$ and $c = \sqrt{20} = 2 \sqrt{5}.$  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \boxed{4 \sqrt{5}}.$
We attempt to solve the system $y = x^2+2$ and $y^2-mx^2=1.$ The first equation gives $x^2 = y-2,$ so we can substitute into the second equation to get \[y^2 - m(y-2) = 1,\]or \[y^2 - my + (2m-1) = 0.\]For the parabola and hyperbola to be tangent, this equation must have exactly one solution for $y,$ so the discriminant must be zero: \[m^2 - 4(2m-1) = 0.\]Thus, $m^2 - 8m + 4 = 0,$ which gives \[m = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4 \cdot 4}}{2} = 4 \pm 2\sqrt{3}.\]To choose between the two possible values of $m,$ we attempt to solve for $y$ in the equation $y^2 - my + (2m-1) = 0.$ For $m = 4 \pm 2\sqrt{3},$ we have \[y = \frac{m \pm \sqrt{m^2 - 4(2m-1)}}{2} = \frac{m}{2},\]because these values of $m$ make the discriminant zero
Since $y = x^2+2,$ we have $y \ge 2,$ so we must have $\frac{m}{2} \ge 2,$ or $m \ge 4.$ Therefore, we must choose the root $m = \boxed{4+2\sqrt3}.$ (Note that only the top branch of the hyperbola is shown below, in blue.)

Adding the equations, we get
\[x + y = x^2 + 15x + 32 + y^2 + 49y + 593,\]or $x^2 + 14x + y^2 + 48y + 625.$  Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get
\[(x + 7)^2 + (y + 24)^2 = 0.\]We can check that $\boxed{(-7,-24)}$ lies on both parabolas, so this is the point of tangency.
From the equation $z^3 = -8,$ $z^3 + 8 = 0.$   We see that $z = -2$ is one solution, so we can take out a factor of $z + 2 = 0,$ which gives us
\[(z + 2)(z^2 - 2z + 4) = 0.\]By the quadratic formula, the roots of $z^2 - 2z + 4 = 0$ are
\[z = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 4}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 2i \sqrt{3}}{2} = 1 \pm i \sqrt{3}.\]Thus, the solutions are $\boxed{-2, 1 + i \sqrt{3}, 1 - i \sqrt{3}}.$
We can use the coefficient of the $x^3$ term to find $b$
On the right we have $-14x^3$, and on the left, the only $x^3$ terms we will get when we expand are $-3x(ax^2)$ and $5x^2(bx)$.
So we must have
$$-3ax^3 + 5bx^3 = -14x^3$$which means
$$5b - 3a = -14$$To find $a$, we use the same reasoning and look at the $x^4$ terms
On the right we have $15x^4$, and on the left, the only $x^4$ term we will get when we expand is $5x^2(ax^2)$
Then we know that
$$5ax^4 = 15x^4$$which means that $a=3$.
Then $5b -3(3) = -14$ and $b = \boxed{-1}$.
Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real
\[(x + yi)^4 = x^4 + 4ix^3 y - 6x^2 y^2 - 4ixy^3 + y^4 = -4.\]Equating real and imaginary parts, we get
\begin{align*}
x^4 - 6x^2 y^2 + y^4 &= -4, \\
4x^3 y - 4xy^3 &= 0.
\end{align*}From the equation $4x^3 y - 4xy^3 = 0,$ $4xy(x^2 - y^2) = 0.$  If $x = 0,$ then $y^4 = -4,$ which has no solutions
If $y = 0,$ then $x^4 = -4,$ which has no solutions
Otherwise, $x^2 = y^2.$
Then the first equation becomes $-4x^4 = -4,$ so $x^4 = 1.$  Hence, $x = 1$ or $x = -1.$  In either case, $x^2 = 1,$ so $y^2 = 1,$ and $y = \pm 1.$  Therefore, the solutions are $\boxed{1 + i, 1 - i, -1 + i, -1 - i}.$
We would like to factor the left-hand side in the form \[
(x^2-\boxed{\phantom{09}})(x^2-\boxed{\phantom{25}}).
\] The numbers in the boxes must multiply to give $225$ and add to give $34$
We write $225=3\cdot3\cdot5\cdot5$ and try a few different pairs until we find that 9 and 25 satisfy the requirements
We factor further using difference of squares and solve
\begin{align*}
(x^2-9)(x^2-25)&=0 \\
(x+3)(x-3)(x-5)(x+5)&=0 \\
x = \pm 3, x=\pm 5&
\end{align*} The smallest of these solutions is $x=\boxed{-5}$.
Without loss of generality, assume that $F_1 F_2 = 2,$ so $c = 1.$  Since triangle $QF_1 F_2$ is equilateral, $b = \sqrt{3}$ and $a = 2.$

Let $s$ be the side length of equilateral triangle $PQR,$ and let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{PR}.$  Then $RM = \frac{s}{2}.$  Also, $RF_1 = QR - QF_1 = s - 2,$ so the distance from $R$ to the $x$-axis is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} (s - 2).$
Hence, $R = \left( \frac{s}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} (s - 2) \right).$  Substituting these coordinates into the equation of the ellipse, we get
\[\frac{(\frac{s}{2})^2}{4} + \frac{(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} (s - 2))^2}{3} = 1.\]This simplifies to $5s^2 = 16s,$ so $s = \frac{16}{5}.$  Therefore,
\[\frac{PQ}{F_1 F_2} = \frac{16/5}{2} = \boxed{\frac{8}{5}}.\]
By the change-of-base formula, the equation becomes
\[\log_a 2 + \log_a 3 + \log_a 4 = 1.\]Then $\log_a 24 = 1,$ so $a = \boxed{24}.$
Note that $2^4 = 4^2,$ so from (iii), either $f(2) = 4$ or $f(4) = 2.$  But from (i),
\[f(4) > f(3) > f(2) > f(1),\]so $f(4) \ge 4.$   Hence, $f(2) = 4.$  By applying (ii) repeatedly, we find that
\[f(2^n) = 2^{2n}\]for all positive integers $n.$
From (i) and (iii),
\[f(3)^2 = f(9) > f(8) = 64,\]so $f(3) \ge 9.$
Similarly,
\[f(3)^8 = f(3^8) < f(2^{13}) = 2^{26},\]so $f(3) \le 9.$  Therefore, $f(3) = 9.$  It follows that $f(3^n) = 3^{2n}$ for all positive integers $n.$
\[f(5)^3 = f(5^3) < f(2^7) = 2^{14},\]so $f(5) \le 25.$
\[f(5)^{11} = f(5^{11}) > f(3^{16}) = 3^{32},\]so $f(5) \ge 25.$  Therefore, $f(5) = 25.$
Hence,
\[f(30) = f(2) f(3) f(5) = 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 25 = \boxed{900}.\]Note that the function $f(n) = n^2$ satisfies all the given properties
(It can be shown that the only solutions to $n^m = m^n$ where $m \neq n$ are $(2,4)$ and $(4,2).$)
Setting $x = y = 0,$ we get
\[f(0)^2 = 4f(0)^2.\]Then $f(0)^2 = 0,$ so $f(0) = 0.$
Setting $x = y,$ we get
\[4f(x)^2 - 4x^2 f(x) = 0,\]so $f(x) (f(x) - x^2) = 0.$  This tells us that for each value of $x,$ either $f(x) = 0$ or $f(x) = x^2.$  (Note that it does not tell us that either $f(x) = 0$ for all $x,$ or $f(x) = x^2$ for all $x.$)
We can easily check that $f(x) = x^2$ satisfies the given functional equation
Otherwise, there exists some nonzero real number $a$ such that $f(a) = 0.$  Setting $y = a,$ we get
\[f(x + a) f(x - a) = f(x)^2\]for all $x.$  Suppose there exists a real number $b$ such that $f(b) \neq 0.$  Then $f(b) = b^2.$  Substituting $x = b$ into the equation above, we get
\[f(b + a) f(b - a) = f(b)^2 = b^4.\]Since $f(b) = b^2 \neq 0,$ both $f(b + a)$ and $f(b - a)$ must be nonzero
Therefore, $f(b + a) = (b + a)^2$ and $f(b - a) = (b - a)^2,$ and
\[(b + a)^2 (b - a)^2 = b^4.\]Expanding, we get $a^4 - 2a^2 b^2 + b^4 = b^4,$ so $a^4 - 2a^2 b^2 = 0$
Then $a^2 (a^2 - 2b^2) = 0.$  Since $a$ is nonzero, $a^2 = 2b^2,$ which leads to $b = \pm \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}.$
This tells us that if there exists some nonzero real number $a$ such that $f(a) = 0,$ then the only possible values of $x$ such that $f(x) \neq 0$ are $x = \pm \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}.$  We must have that $f(x) = 0$ for all other values of $x.$  We can then choose a different value of $a'$ such that $f(a') = 0,$ which leads to $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$ other than $x = \pm \frac{a'}{\sqrt{2}}.$  This forces $f(x) = 0$ for all $x,$ which easily satisfies the given functional equation.
Therefore, there are only $\boxed{2}$ functions that work, namely $f(x) = 0$ and $f(x) = x^2.$
Let $w$ be the complex number corresponding to the point $S.$  Since $PQSR$ is a parallelogram,
\[w = (1 + i) z + 2 \overline{z} - z,\]so $w = 2 \overline{z} + iz.$  Then $\overline{w} = 2z - i \overline{z},$ so
\begin{align*}
|w|^2 &= w \overline{w} \\
&= (2 \overline{z} + iz)(2z - i \overline{z}) \\
&= 4 z \overline{z} + 2iz^2 - 2i \overline{z}^2 + z \overline{z} \\
&= 5|z|^2 + 2i (z^2 - \overline{z}^2) \\
&= 2i (z^2 - \overline{z}^2) + 5.
\end{align*}Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers
Since $|z| = 1,$ $x^2 + y^2 = 1.$  Also,
\begin{align*}
2i (z^2 - \overline{z}^2) &= 2i ((x + yi)^2 - (x - yi)^2) \\
&= 2i (4ixy) \\
&= -8xy,
\end{align*}so $|w|^2 = 5 - 8xy.$
By the Trivial Inequality, $(x + y)^2 \ge 0.$  Then $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \ge 0,$ so $2xy + 1 \ge 0.$  Hence, $-8xy \le 4,$ so
\[|w|^2 = 5 - 8xy \le 9,\]which implies $|w| \le 3.$
Equality occurs when $z = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}},$ so the maximum distance between $S$ and the origin is $\boxed{3}.$
We want to maximize
\[|(3 + 4i)z^3 - z^5| = |z^3| |3 + 4i - z^2| = |z|^3 |3 + 4i - z^2| = 8 |3 + 4i - z^2|.\]In other words, we want to maximize the distance between $3 + 4i$ and $z^2.$
Since $|z| = 2,$ the set of complex numbers of the form $z^2$ lie on a circle with radius $|z|^2 = 4.$  The distance between $3 + 4i$ and $z^2$ is maximized when $z^2$ lies on the line passing through the origin and the $3 + 4i.$  (This line intersects the circle at two points, so we take the one that is farther from $3 + 4i.$)

dot("$3 + 4i$", (3,4), NE);
dot("$z^2$", (-4/5)*(3,4), SW);
[/asy]
For this number, the distance between $3 + 4i$ and $z^2$ is $4 + 5 = 9,$ so the maximum value of $8 |3 + 4i - z^2|$ is $8 \cdot 9 = \boxed{72}.$
By AM-GM,
\[2 \cos \theta + \frac{1}{\sin \theta} + \sqrt{2} \tan \theta \ge 3 \sqrt[3]{2 \cos \theta \cdot \frac{1}{\sin \theta} \cdot \sqrt{2} \tan \theta} = 3 \sqrt{2}.\]Equality occurs when $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4},$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{3 \sqrt{2}}.$
We can write \[\frac{1}{n^2+n} = \frac{(n+1) - n}{n(n+1)} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1}.\]Thus, the sum telescopes: \[\sum_{n=1}^{1000} \frac{1}{n^2+n} = \left(\frac11-\frac12\right)+\left(\frac12-\frac23\right)+\dots+\left(\frac1{1000}-\frac1{1001}\right) = \frac11-\frac1{1001} = \boxed{\frac{1000}{1001}}.\]
\[f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 1} + \frac{2}{x - 2} + \frac{3}{x - 3} + \dots + \frac{100}{x - 100}.\]Consider the graph of $y = f(x).$

The graph of $y = f(x)$ has vertical asymptotes at $x = 1,$ $x = 2,$ $\dots,$ $x = 100.$  In particular, $f(x)$ approaches $-\infty$ as $x$ approaches $n$ from the left, and $f(x)$ approaches $\infty$ as $x$ approaches $n$ from the right, for $1 \le n \le 100.$  Furthermore, $y = 0$ is a vertical asymptote
In particular, $f(x)$ approaches 0 as $x$ approaches both $\infty$ and $-\infty.$
Thus, the graph of $y = f(x)$ intersects the graph of $y = x$ exactly once on each of the intervals $(-\infty,1),$ $(1,2),$ $(2,3),$ $\dots,$ $(99,100),$ $(100,\infty).$  Therefore, there are a total of $\boxed{101}$ real solutions.
The inequality $x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0$ factors as $(x - 2)(x - 3) < 0,$ so the solution is $2 < x < 3.$  Since $x^2 + 5x + 6$ is increasing on this interval, we have that
\[x^2 + 5x + 6 > 2^2 + 5 \cdot 2 + 6 = 20\]and
\[x^2 + 5x + 6 < 3^2 + 5 \cdot 3 + 6 = 30.\]Therefore, the set of possible values of $x^2 + 5x + 6$ is $\boxed{(20,30)}.$
Since $0 \le c \le 1,$ $\sqrt{c} \le 1$ and $\sqrt{1 - c} \le 1,$ so
\[\sqrt{abc} + \sqrt{(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c)} \le \sqrt{ab} + \sqrt{(1 - a)(1 - b)}.\]Then by AM-GM,
\[\sqrt{ab} \le \frac{a + b}{2}\]and
\[\sqrt{(1 - a)(1 - b)} \le \frac{(1 - a) + (1 - b)}{2} = \frac{2 - a - b}{2},\]so
\[\sqrt{ab} + \sqrt{(1 - a)(1 - b)} \le \frac{a + b}{2} + \frac{2 - a - b}{2} = 1.\]Equality occurs when $a = b = c = 0,$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{1}.$
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
x + 2y &\ge 2 \sqrt{2xy}, \\
y + 2z &\ge 2 \sqrt{2yz}, \\
xz + 1 &\ge 2 \sqrt{xz},
\end{align*}so
\[(x + 2y)(y + 2z)(xz + 1) \ge (2 \sqrt{2xy})(2 \sqrt{2yz})(2 \sqrt{xz}) = 16xyz = 16.\]Equality occurs when $x = 2y,$ $y = 2z,$ and $xz = 1.$  We can solve to get $x = 2,$ $y = 1,$ and $z = \frac{1}{2},$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{16}.$
First, we write the given equation as
\[\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{x + 7} + 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 7x} + 2x = 35.\]Let $y = \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{x + 7}.$  Then
\[y^2 = x + 2 \sqrt{x(x + 7)} + x + 7 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 7x} + 2x + 7.\]Hence, $y + y^2 - 7 = 35.$  Then $y^2 + y - 42 = 0,$ which factors as $(y - 6)(y + 7) = 0.$  Since $y$ is positive, $y = 6.$
Hence,
\[\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{x + 7} = 6.\]Then $\sqrt{x + 7} = 6 - \sqrt{x}.$  Squaring both sides, we get
\[x + 7 = 36 - 12 \sqrt{x} + x.\]Then $12 \sqrt{x} = 29,$ so $x = \left( \frac{29}{12} \right)^2 = \boxed{\frac{841}{144}}.$  We check that this solution works.
If $x \neq -7,$ then we can cancel the factors of $x + 7$ to get
\[h(x) = 2(x - 3).\]If $x$ were allowed to be any real number, then $2(x - 3)$ could also be any real number
However, the function is not defined for $x = -7,$ so the function cannot take on the value $2(-7 - 3) = -20.$
Therefore, the range of the function is $\boxed{(-\infty,-20) \cup (-20,\infty)}.$
We pair up the terms in the product as follows: $$
\left(\frac{1}{2} \times 4\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{8} \times 16\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{32} \times 64\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{128} \times 256\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{512} \times 1024\right).
$$The value inside each pair of parentheses is $2,$ so the answer is $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = \boxed{32}.$
Since $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are nonnegative real numbers such that $x + y + z = 1,$ $0 \le x,$ $y,$ $z \le 1.$  Then $y^2 \le y$ and $z^3 \le z,$ so
\[x + y^2 + z^3 \le x + y + z = 1.\]Equality occurs when $x = 1,$ $y = 0,$ and $z = 0,$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{1}.$
From the given information we know that $|a| |b| = |ab| = 2\sqrt{26}$
We can also write $|ab| = |t-2i| = \sqrt{t^2 + 4}$
Setting these equal, we have $$\sqrt{t^2 + 4} = 2\sqrt{26} \Rightarrow
t^2 + 4 = 104.$$The positive answer is $t = \boxed{10}$.
Let $r$ and $s$ be the roots of $2x^2 - 3x - 11 = 0,$ so by Vieta's formulas, $r + s = \frac{3}{2}$ and $rs = -\frac{11}{2}.$
\begin{align*}
\frac{4r^3 - 4s^3}{r - s} &= \frac{4(r - s)(r^2 + rs + s^2)}{r - s} \\
&= 4 (r^2 + rs + s^2) \\
&= 4 [(r + s)^2 - rs] \\
&= 4 \left[ \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{11}{2} \right] \\
&= \boxed{31}.
\end{align*}
The definition of $f$ lets us evaluate $f(2)$: \[f(2)=\frac{b}{2\cdot2-3}=\frac b{1}=b.\]Therefore we want to find all possible $b$ for which \[b=f^{-1}(b+1).\]This is equivalent to  \[f(b)=b+1.\]When we substitute $x=b$ into the definition of $f$ we get  \[f(b)=\frac{b}{2b-3},\]so we are looking for all solutions $b$ to the equation \[\frac{b}{2b-3}=b+1.\]Assuming $b \ne \dfrac32$, we can multiply both sides by $2b - 3$ to get \[b = (2b - 3)(b + 1) = 2b^2 - b - 3,\]so $2b^2 - 2b - 3 = 0$
We note that $b = \dfrac32$ is not a solution
By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $c/a$, so in this case, the product of the roots is $\boxed{-\frac{3}{2}}$.
\[p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n - 1} x^{n - 1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0,\]where $a_n \neq 0.$  Then
\begin{align*}
p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) &= a_n x^{3n} + a_{n - 1} x^{3n - 3} + \dotsb - a_n (x^3 - 2)^n - a_{n - 1} (x^3 - 2)^{n - 1} - \dotsb \\
&= a_n x^{3n} + a_{n - 1} x^{3n - 3} + \dotsb - a_n x^{3n} - 2na_n x^{3n - 3} - \dotsb - a_{n - 1} x^{3n - 3} - \dotsb \\
&= 2n a_n x^{3n - 3} + \dotsb.
\end{align*}Thus, the degree of $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2)$ is $3n - 3.$
The degree of $[p(x)^2] + 12$ is $2n,$ so $3n - 3 = 2n,$ which means $n = 3.$
Let $p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d.$  Then
\begin{align*}
p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) &= ax^9 + bx^6 + cx^3 + d - (a(x^3 - 2)^3 + b(x^3 - 2)^2 + c(x^3 - 2) + d) \\
&= 6ax^6 + (-12a + 4b) x^3 + 8a - 4b + 2c,
\end{align*}and
\[[p(x)]^2 + 12 = a^2 x^6 + 2abx^5 + (2ac + b^2) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x^3 + (2bd + c^2) x^2 + 2cdx + d^2 + 12.\]Comparing coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
a^2 &= 6a, \\
2ab &= 0, \\
2ac + b^2 &= 0, \\
2ad + 2bc &= -12a + 4b, \\
2bd + c^2 &= 0, \\
2cd &= 0, \\
d^2 + 12 &= 8a - 4b + 2c.
\end{align*}From the equation $a^2 = 6a,$ $a = 0$ or $a = 6.$  But since $a$ is a leading coefficient, $a$ cannot be 0, so $a = 6.$
From the equation $2ab = 0,$ $b = 0.$
Then the equation $2ac + b^2 = 0$ becomes $12c = 0,$ so $c = 0.$
Then the equation $2ad + 2bc = -12a + 4b$ becomes $12d = -72,$ so $d = -6.$  Note that $(a,b,c,d) = (6,0,0,-6)$ satisfies all the equations.
Therefore, $p(x) = \boxed{6x^3 - 6}.$
Let $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of $z$, respectively
Then $\bar{z}=a-bi$, so that $-3i\bar{z}=-3b-3ia$
We now find that \[ 2z-3i\bar{z} = 2a+2ib -3b - 3ia = (2a-3b) + (2b-3a)i
\]So if $2z-3i\bar{z}=-7+3i$ then (by matching real and imaginary components) we must have $2a-3b=-7$ and $-3a+2b=3$
This system of equations is routine to solve, leading to the values $a=1$ and $b=3$
Therefore the complex number we are seeking is $z=\boxed{1+3i}$.
Let $x = 2 * (3 * ( \dotsb (999 * 1000) \dotsb ))).$  Then
\[1 * (2 * (3 * (\dotsb (999 * 1000) \dotsb))) = 1 * x = \frac{1 - x}{1 - x} = \boxed{1}.\]For the sake of rigor, we should prove that $x \neq 1.$  This is left as an exercise for the reader.
Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get
\[\frac{8x^2 + 16x - 51 - 3(2x - 3)(x + 4)}{(2x - 3)(x + 4)} < 0.\]Then
\[\frac{2x^2 + x - 15}{(2x - 3)(x + 4)} < 0,\]or
\[\frac{(x + 3)(2x - 5)}{(x + 4)(2x - 3)} < 0.\]We can build a sign chart, but since all of the factors are linear, we can track what happens to the expression as $x$ increases
At $x = -5,$ the expression is positive
As $x$ increases past $-4,$ the expression becomes negative
As $x$ increases past $-3,$ the expression becomes positive, and so on
Thus, the solution is
\[x \in \boxed{(-4,-3) \cup \left( \frac{3}{2}, \frac{5}{2} \right)}.\]
Setting $y = 0,$ we get
\[f(f(x)) = xf(0) + f(x)\]for all $x.$  In particular, $f(f(0)) = f(0).$
Setting $x = f(0)$ and $y = 0,$ we get
\[f(f(f(0))) = f(0)^2 + f(f(0)).\]Note that $f(f(f(0))) = f(f(0)) = f(0)$ and $f(f(0)) = f(0),$ so $f(0) = f(0)^2 + f(0).$  Then $f(0)^2 = 0,$ so $f(0) = 0.$  It follows that
\[f(f(x)) = f(x)\]for all $x.$
Setting $x = 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[f(y + 1) = f(y) + 1\]for all $y.$  Replacing $y$ with $f(x),$ we get
\[f(f(x) + 1) = f(f(x)) + 1 = f(x) + 1.\]For nonzero $x,$ set $y = \frac{1}{x}$ in the given functional equation
\[f(1 + f(x)) = x f \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) + f(x).\]Then $x f \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) + f(x) = f(x) + 1,$ so $xf \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = 1,$ which means
\[f \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{1}{x}\]for all $x \neq 0.$
We conclude that $f(x) = x$ for all $x.$  Therefore, $n = 1$ and $s = \frac{1}{2},$ so $n \times s = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
From the equation $a + b + c = 0,$ $c = -a - b.$  Hence,
\begin{align*}
\frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{abc} &= -\frac{a^3 + b^3 - (a + b)^3}{ab(a + b)} \\
&= \frac{3a^2 b + 3ab^2}{ab(a + b)} \\
&= \frac{3ab(a + b)}{ab(a + b)} \\
&= \boxed{3}.
\end{align*}By the Multivariable Factor Theorem, this implies that $a + b + c$ is a factor of $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc.$  We can then factor, to get the factorization.
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc).\]
Setting $b = a$ and $c = a,$ we get
\[a \, \diamondsuit \, (a \, \diamondsuit \, a) = (a \, \diamondsuit \, a) \cdot a,\]which reduces to $a \, \diamondsuit \, 1 = a$ for any nonzero $a.$
Setting $c = b,$ we get
\[a \, \diamondsuit \, (b \, \diamondsuit \, b) = (a \, \diamondsuit \, b) \cdot b,\]which reduces to $a \, \diamondsuit \, 1 = (a \, \diamondsuit \, b) \cdot b,$ so $a = (a \, \diamondsuit \, b) \cdot b.$  Hence,
\[a \, \diamondsuit \, b = \frac{a}{b}\]for any nonzero $a$ and $b.$
We want to solve $2016 \, \diamondsuit \, (6 \, \diamondsuit\, x) = 100,$ or
\[\frac{2016}{\frac{6}{x}} = 100.\]Solving, we find $x = \boxed{\frac{25}{84}}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
\frac{F_k}{F_{k - 1}} - \frac{F_k}{F_{k + 1}} &= \frac{F_k F_{k + 1}}{F_{k - 1} F_{k + 1}} - \frac{F_{k - 1} F_k}{F_k F_{k + 1}} \\
&= \frac{F_k F_{k + 1} - F_{k - 1} F_k}{F_{k - 1} F_{k + 1}} \\
&= \frac{F_k (F_{k + 1} - F_{k - 1})}{F_{k - 1} F_{k + 1}} \\
&= \frac{F_k^2}{F_{k - 1} F_{k + 1}}.
\end{align*}Thus,
\begin{align*}
\prod_{k = 2}^{100} \left( \frac{F_k}{F_{k - 1}} - \frac{F_k}{F_{k + 1}} \right) &= \prod_{k = 2}^{100} \frac{F_k^2}{F_{k - 1} F_{k + 1}} \\
&= \frac{F_2^2}{F_1 \cdot F_3} \cdot \frac{F_3^2}{F_2 \cdot F_4} \cdot \frac{F_4^2}{F_3 \cdot F_5} \dotsm \frac{F_{99}^2}{F_{98} \cdot F_{100}} \cdot \frac{F_{100}^2}{F_{99} \cdot F_{101}} \\
&= \frac{F_2 \cdot F_{100}}{F_1 \cdot F_{101}} = \frac{F_{100}}{F_{101}}.
\end{align*}Therefore, $(a,b) = \boxed{(100,101)}.$
The graph of $y=f(x-2)$ is just the graph of $y=f(x)$ shifted two units to the right
To see this, note that if $(a,b)$ is a point on the graph of $y=f(x)$, then $(a+2,b)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x-2)$
Then the graph of $y=3f(x-2)$ is the graph of $y=f(x-2)$ scaled by a factor of 3 in the vertical direction
To see this, note that if $(a,b)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x-2)$, then $(a,3b)$ is on the graph of $y=3f(x-2)$
Stretching a region in the plane by a factor of 3 in one dimension increases its area by a factor of 3, so the area between the graph of $y=3f(x-2)$ and the $x$-axis is $\boxed{30}$.
Let $m$ and $n$ be the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x),$ respectively
Then the degree of $f(g(x))$ is $mn.$  The degree of $f(x) g(x)$ is $m + n,$ so
\[mn = m + n.\]Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we get $(m - 1)(n - 1) = 1,$ so $m = n = 2.$
Let $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ and $g(x) = dx^2 + ex + f.$  Then
\[a(dx^2 + ex + f)^2 + b(dx^2 + ex + f) + c = (ax^2 + bx + c)(dx^2 + ex + f).\]Expanding, we get
\begin{align*}
&ad^2 x^4 + 2adex^3 + (2adf + ae^2 + bd) x^2 + (2aef + be)x + af^2 + bf + c \\
&\quad = adx^4 + (ae + bd) x^3 + (af + be + cd) x^2 + (bf + ce) x + cf.
\end{align*}Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
ad^2 &= ad, \\
2ade &= ae + bd, \\
2adf + ae^2 + bd &= af + be + cd, \\
2aef + be &= bf + ce, \\
af^2 + bf + c &= cf.
\end{align*}Since $a$ and $d$ are nonzero, the equation $ad^2 = ad$ tells us $d = 1.$  Thus, the system becomes
\begin{align*}
2ae &= ae + b, \\
2af + ae^2 + b &= af + be + c, \\
2aef + be &= bf + ce, \\
af^2 + bf + c &= cf.
\end{align*}Then $b = ae.$  Substituting, the system becomes
\begin{align*}
2af + ae^2 + ae &= af + ae^2 + c, \\
2aef + ae^2 &= aef + ce, \\
af^2 + aef + c &= cf.
\end{align*}Then $af + ae = c,$ so $af^2 + aef = cf$
Hence, $c = 0,$ which means $ae + af = 0.$ Since $a$ is nonzero, $e + f = 0.$
Now, from $g(2) = 37,$ $4 + 2e + f = 37.$  Hence, $e = 33$ and $f = -33.$  Therefore, $g(x) = \boxed{x^2 + 33x - 33}.$
We can complete the square in $x,$ to get
\[x^2 + xy + y^2 = \left( x + \frac{y}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{3y^2}{4}.\]We see that the minimum value is $\boxed{0},$ which occurs at $x = y = 0.$
Let $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.$  Then from the given information,
\begin{align*}
9a - 3b + c &= 10, \\
c &= 1, \\
4a + 2b + c &= 5.
\end{align*}Then $9a - 3b = 9$ and $4a + 2b = 4,$ which reduce to $3a - b = 3$ and $2a + b = 2.$  Adding, we get $5a = 5,$ so $a = 1.$  Then $4 + 2b = 4,$ so $b = 0.$  Therefore, $p(x) = \boxed{x^2 + 1}.$
We can attempt to deconstruct the summand by applying supposing that it breaks down like a partial fraction:
\[\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} = \frac{A}{3^k - 2^k} + \frac{B}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}}.\]Then
\[6^k = A (3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}) + B (3^k - 2^k),\]which expands as
\[6^k = (3A + B) 3^k - (2A + B) 2^k.\]It makes sense to make both $(3A + B) 3^k$ and $(2A + B) 2^k$ multiples of $6^k$ that differ by $6^k.$  To this end, set $(3A + B) 3^k = (n + 1) 6^k$ and $(2A + B) 2^k = n6^k.$  Then $3A + B = (n + 1) 2^k$ and $2A + B = n3^k$
Subtracting these equations, we get $A = (n + 1) 2^k - n3^k.$  It follows that $B = 3n3^k - 2(n + 1) 2^k,$ which gives us
\[\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} = \frac{(n + 1) 2^k - n3^k}{3^k - 2^k} + \frac{3n3^k - 2(n + 1) 2^k}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}}.\]We can try setting $n$ to different values, to see what we get
If we set $n = 0,$ then we get
\[\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} = \frac{2^k}{3^k - 2^k} - \frac{2^{k + 1}}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}},\]which makes the sum telescope.
Just to make sure the sum converges, we compute the $n$th partial sum:
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} &= \sum_{k = 1}^n \left( \frac{2^k}{3^k - 2^k} - \frac{2^{k + 1}}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}} \right) \\
&= 2 - \frac{2^{n + 1}}{3^{n + 1} - 2^{n + 1}} \\
&= 2 - \frac{1}{(\frac{3}{2})^{n + 1} - 1}.
\end{align*}As $n$ becomes very large, $\left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{n + 1}$ also becomes very large
Thus, the infinite sum is $\boxed{2}.$
Since the coefficient of $f(x)$ are real, the nonreal roots of $f(x)$ must come in conjugate pairs
Furthermore, the magnitude of a complex number and its conjugate are always equal
If $n$ is the number of magnitudes $|r_i|$ that correspond to nonreal roots, then $f(x)$ has at least $2n$ nonreal roots, which means it has at most $2006 - 2n$ real roots.
Also, this leaves $1006 - n$ magnitudes that correspond to real roots, which means that the number of real roots is at least $1006 - n.$  Hence,
\[1006 - n \le 2006 - 2n,\]so $n \le 1000.$  Then the number of real roots is at least $1006 - n \ge 6.$
The monic polynomial with roots $\pm i,$ $\pm 2i,$ $\dots,$ $\pm 1000i,$ 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006 satisfies the conditions, and has 6 real roots, so the minimum number of real roots is $\boxed{6}.$
The formula for $g(x)$ has a defined value unless its denominator is $0$; thus we must exclude $-8$ from the domain
The domain of $g(x)$ is $\boxed{(-\infty, -8) \cup (-8, \infty)}$.
Using the second part of the definition, we get \[h(100) = 1 + h(101) = 2 + h(102) = 3 + h(103) = \dots = 28 + h(128).\]Since $128 = 2^7,$ we use the first part of the definition to get \[h(100) = 28 + 7 = \boxed{35}.\]
We try completing the square in $x$ again, that gives \[ (x-3)^2 - 9 + 2y^2 - 8y + 21 = 0.\]Then completing the square in $y$ gives \[ (x-3)^2 - 9 + 2(y-2)^2 - 8 + 21 =  0.\]Combining all the constants we have \[ (x-3)^2 + 2(y-2)^2 = -4.\]The left hand side is always nonnegative, so this graph is $\boxed{\text{empty}}$.
To find $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4,$ we can try to find a quartic equation whose roots are $x_1,$ $x_2,$ $x_3,$ and $x_4.$  To this end, we substitute $y = (x + 1)^2$ into $x + 4 = (y - 3)^2,$ to get
\[x + 4 = ((x + 1)^2 - 3)^2.\]Expanding, we get $x^4 + 4x^3 - 9x = 0.$  By Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = -4.$
Substituting $x = (y - 3)^2 - 4$ into $y = (x + 1)^2,$ we get
\[y = ((y - 3)^2 - 3)^2.\]Expanding, we get $y^4 - 12y^3 + 48y^2 - 73y + 36 = 0.$  By Vieta's formulas, $y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 12.$
Therefore, $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = \boxed{8}.$
By GM-HM applied to 1 and $\frac{a}{b + c + d},$
\[\sqrt{1 \cdot \frac{a}{b + c + d}} \ge \frac{2}{\frac{1}{1} + \frac{b + c + d}{a}} = \frac{2a}{a + b + c + d}.\]Similarly,
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{\frac{b}{a + c + d}} &\ge \frac{2b}{a + b + c + d}, \\
\sqrt{\frac{c}{a + b + d}} &\ge \frac{2c}{a + b + c + d}, \\
\sqrt{\frac{d}{a + b + c}} &\ge \frac{2d}{a + b + c + d}.
\end{align*}Adding up all these inequalities, we get
\[\sqrt{\frac{a}{b + c + d}} + \sqrt{\frac{b}{a + c + d}} + \sqrt{\frac{c}{a + b + d}} + \sqrt{\frac{d}{a + b + c}} \ge \frac{2a + 2b + 2c + 2d}{a + b + c + d} = 2.\]The only we can get equality is if
\begin{align*}
a &= b + c + d, \\
b &= a + c + d, \\
c &= a + b + d, \\
d &= a + b + c.
\end{align*}Adding these equations, we get $a + b + c + d = 3(a + b + c + d),$ so $a + b + c + d = 0,$ which is impossible
Thus, equality is not possible.
However, by setting $a = c = 1$ and $b = d = \epsilon,$ where $\epsilon$ is a small positive number, then
\[\sqrt{\frac{a}{b + c + d}} + \sqrt{\frac{b}{a + c + d}} + \sqrt{\frac{c}{a + b + d}} + \sqrt{\frac{d}{a + b + c}} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{1 + 2 \epsilon}} + 2 \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{2 + \epsilon}}.\]As $\epsilon$ approaches 0, the expression approaches 2
Thus, we can make the expression arbitrarily close to 2, so $m = \boxed{2}.$
The sum of the distances from $(14, -3)$ to the two foci is \[\sqrt{(14-2)^2 + (-3-2)^2} + \sqrt{(14-2)^2 + (-3-6)^2} = 13 + 15 = 28.\]Therefore, the major axis has length $28.$ Since the distance between the foci is $\sqrt{(2-2)^2 + (2-6)^2} = 4,$ it follows that the length of the minor axis is $\sqrt{28^2 - 4^2} = 4\sqrt{7^2 - 1} = 4\sqrt{48} = 16\sqrt3.$
The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment between the foci, which is $(2, 4).$ Since the foci and the center have the same $x$-coordinate, the major axis is parallel to the $y$-axis, and the minor axis is parallel to the $x$-axis
Putting all this together, we get the equation of the ellipse: \[\frac{(x-2)^2}{(8\sqrt3)^2} + \frac{(y-4)^2}{14^2} = 1
\]Thus, $(a, b, h, k) = \boxed{ (8\sqrt3, 14, 2, 4)}.$
Let $f(x)$ be the given expression
We first examine the possible values of $f(x)$ for $x$ in the interval $(0, 1].$ Note that $f(0) = 0,$ while $f(1) = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20.$
As we increase $x$ from $0$ to $1,$ each of the four floor functions "jumps up" by $1$ at certain points
Furthermore, if multiple floor functions "jump up" at the same value of $x,$ then some integers will be skipped.
For each $k,$ the function $\lfloor kx \rfloor$ "jumps up" at $x = \tfrac{1}{k}, \tfrac{2}{k}, \ldots, \tfrac{k-1}{k}, \tfrac{k}{k}.$ Therefore, we see that at $x = \tfrac{1}{2}$ and $x = 1,$ all four of the given functions "jump up," so that three integers are skipped
Also, for $x = \tfrac{1}{4}$ and $x =\tfrac{3}{4},$ the functions $\lfloor 4x \rfloor$ and $\lfloor 8x \rfloor$ both "jump up," skipping one integer.
Thus, for $0 < x \le 1,$ $f(x)$ takes $20 - 3 - 3 - 1 - 1 = 12$ positive integer values
Notice that \[\begin{aligned} f(x+1) &= \lfloor 2(x+1) \rfloor + \lfloor 4(x+1) \rfloor + \lfloor 6(x+1) \rfloor + \lfloor 8(x+1) \rfloor \\ &= \left(\lfloor 2x \rfloor+2\right) + \left(\lfloor 4x \rfloor +4\right)+ \left(\lfloor 6x\rfloor+6 \right)+ \left(\lfloor 8x \rfloor +8\right) \\ &= f(x) + 20
\end{aligned}\]Therefore, in the interval $1 < x \le 2,$ $f(x)$ takes $12$ more integer values between $21$ and $40,$ respectively
In general, $f(x)$ takes $12$ out of every $20$ positive integer values from the list $20a, 20a+1, \ldots, 2a+19.$
Since $20$ is a divisor of $1000,$ exactly $\tfrac{12}{20} = \tfrac{3}{5}$ of the first $1000$ positive integers are possible values for $f(x).$ Thus the answer is $1000 \cdot \tfrac{3}{5} = \boxed{600}.$
For the sum $b_n,$ let $j = n - k,$ so $k = n - j.$  Then
\begin{align*}
b_n &= \sum_{k = 0}^n \frac{k}{\binom{n}{k}} \\
&= \sum_{j = n}^0 \frac{n - j}{\binom{n}{n - j}} \\
&= \sum_{j = 0}^n \frac{n - j}{\binom{n}{j}} \\
&= \sum_{k = 0}^n \frac{n - k}{\binom{n}{k}},
\end{align*}so
\[b_n + b_n = \sum_{k = 0}^n \frac{k}{\binom{n}{k}} + \sum_{k = 0}^n \frac{n - k}{\binom{n}{k}} = \sum_{k = 0}^n \frac{n}{\binom{n}{k}} = n \sum_{k = 0}^n \frac{1}{\binom{n}{k}} = na_n.\]Then $2b_n = na_n,$ so $\frac{a_n}{b_n} = \boxed{\frac{2}{n}}.$
For $n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,$ define $s_n = ax^n + by^n.$ We are given the values of $s_1, s_2, s_3,$ and $s_4,$ and want to compute $s_5.$
We find a relationship between the terms $s_n.$ Notice that \[\begin{aligned} (x+y)(ax^n + by^n) &= ax^{n+1} + bxy^n + ax^ny + by^{n+1} \\ &= (ax^{n+1} + by^{n+1}) + xy(ax^{n-1} + by^{n-1})
\end{aligned}\]In other words, $(x+y) s_n= s_{n+1} + xys_{n-1}$ for all $n.$ Therefore, taking $n=2$ and $n=3,$ we get \[\begin{aligned} 7(x+y) &= 16 + 3xy \\ 16(x+y) &= 42 + 7xy
\end{aligned}\]Solving this system of equations for $x+y$ and $xy$ gives $x+y = -14$ and $x=-38.$ Thus, taking $n=4,$ we get \[42(x+y) = s_5 + 16xy,\]so \[s_5 = 42(-14) - 16(-38) = \boxed{20}.\]
Let $S = a_1 a_2 a_3 + b_1 b_2 b_3 + c_1 c_2 c_3.$  Then by AM-GM,
\[S \ge 3 \sqrt[3]{a_1 a_2 a_3 b_1 b_2 b_3 c_1 c_2 c_3} = 3 \sqrt[3]{9!} \approx 213.98.\]Since $S$ is an integer, $S \ge 214.$
Note that
\[2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 + 1 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 + 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 = 214,\]so the smallest possible value of $S$ is $\boxed{214}.$
Graphing the function, or trying different values of $x,$ we may think that the function is maximized at $x = 1,$ which would make the maximum value 2.
To confirm this, we can consider the expression
\[2 - f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2.\]We know that this is zero at $x = 1,$ so $x - 1$ is a factor:
\[2 - f(x) = (x - 1)(x^2 + x - 2) = (x - 1)^2 (x + 2).\]Since $0 \le x \le \sqrt{3},$ $x + 2$ is always positive
Hence, $f(x) \le 2$ for all $x,$ which confirms that the maximum value is $\boxed{2}.$
Recall that a parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus $F$ and the directrix.
Since the parabola $x = -\frac{1}{6} y^2$ is symmetric about the $x$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(f,0).$  Let $x = d$ be the equation of the directrix.

Let $\left( -\frac{1}{6} y^2, y \right)$ be a point on the parabola $x = -\frac{1}{6} y^2.$  Then
\[PF^2 = \left( -\frac{1}{6} y^2 - f \right)^2 + y^2\]and $PQ^2 = \left( -\frac{1}{6} y^2 - d \right)^2.$  Thus,
\[\left( -\frac{1}{6} y^2 - f \right)^2 + y^2 = \left( -\frac{1}{6} y^2 - d \right)^2.\]Expanding, we get
\[\frac{1}{36} y^4 + \frac{f}{3} y^2 + f^2 + y^2 = \frac{1}{36} y^4 + \frac{d}{3} y^2 + d^2.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
\frac{f}{3} + 1 &= \frac{d}{3}, \\
f^2 &= d^2.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $d - f = 3.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $2d = 3,$ so $d = \frac{3}{2}.$
Thus, the equation of the directrix is $\boxed{x = \frac{3}{2}}.$
The sum of the distances from $(4, -2)$ to the foci of the ellipse is \[\sqrt{(4+1)^2 + (-1+2)^2} + \sqrt{(4+1)^2 + (-3+2)^2} = 2\sqrt{26}.\]This is also equal to the length of the major axis of the ellipse
Since the distance between the foci is $2,$ it follows that the length of the minor axis of the ellipse is $\sqrt{(2\sqrt{26})^2 - 2^2} = 10.$
The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment containing points $(-1, -1)$ and $(-1, -3),$ which is $(-1, -2).$ Since the two foci have the same $x$-coordinate, the vertical axis is the major axis
Putting all this together, we get that the equation of the ellipse is \[\frac{(x+1)^2}{5^2} + \frac{(y+2)^2}{(\sqrt{26})^2} = 1.\]Thus, $a+k = 5 + (-2) = \boxed{3}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
f(f(x) + x) &= f(x^2 + (a + 1) x + b) \\
&= (x^2 + (a + 1)x + b)^2 + a(x^2 + (a + 1) x + b) + b \\
&= x^4 + (2a + 2) x^3 + (a^2 + 3a + 2b + 1) x^2 + (a^2 + 2ab + a + 2b) x + (ab + b^2 + b).
\end{align*}We can write this as
\begin{align*}
&x^4 + (2a + 2) x^3 + (a^2 + 3a + 2b + 1) x^2 + (a^2 + 2ab + a + 2b) x + (ab + b^2 + b) \\
&= x^2 (x^2 + ax + b) + (a + 2) x^3 + (a^2 + 3a + b + 1) x^2 + (a^2 + 2ab + a + 2b) x + (ab + b^2 + b) \\
&= x^2 (x^2 + ax + b) + (a + 2)x \cdot (x^2 + ax + b) + (a + b + 1) x^2 + (a^2 + ab + a) x + (ab + b^2 + b) \\
&= x^2 (x^2 + ax + b) + (a + 2)x \cdot (x^2 + ax + b) + (a + b + 1)(x^2 + ax + b) \\
&= (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + (a + 2) x + (a + b + 1)).
\end{align*}(The factor of $f(x) = x^2 + ax + b$ should not be surprising
Thus, we want $a$ and $b$ to satisfy $a + 2 = 1776$ and $a + b + 1 = 2010.$  Solving, we find $a = 1774$ and $b = 235,$ so $f(x) = \boxed{x^2 + 1774x + 235}.$
Since $z^7 = -1,$ $|z^7| = 1.$  Then $|z|^7 = 1,$ so $|z| = 1.$  Then $z \overline{z} = |z|^2 = 1,$ so $\overline{z} = \frac{1}{z}.$  Hence,
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{|1 - z|^2} &= \frac{1}{(1 - z)(\overline{1 - z})} \\
&= \frac{1}{(1 - z)(1 - \overline{z})} \\
&= \frac{1}{(1 - z)(1 - \frac{1}{z})} \\
&= \frac{z}{(1 - z)(z - 1)} \\
&= -\frac{z}{(z - 1)^2}.
\end{align*}Let $z = \frac{1}{w} + 1.$  Then
\[-\frac{z}{(z - 1)^2} = -\frac{\frac{1}{w} + 1}{\frac{1}{w^2}} = -w - w^2.\]From $z^7 = -1,$
\[\left( \frac{1}{w} + 1 \right)^7 = -1.\]Then $(1 + w)^7 = -w^7.$  Expanding, we get
\[2w^7 + 7w^6 + 21w^5 + 35w^4 + 35w^3 + 21w^2 + 7w + 1 = 0.\]Let the roots of $z^7 = -1$ be $z_1,$ $z_2,$ $\dots,$ $z_7,$ and let $w_k$ be the corresponding value of $z_k,$ i.e
$z_k = \frac{1}{w_k} + 1.$  Then
\[\sum_{k = 1}^7 \frac{1}{|1 - z_k|^2} = \sum_{k = 1}^7 (-w_k - w_k^2).\]By Vieta's formulas, $w_1 + w_2 + \dots + w_7 = -\frac{7}{2}$ and $w_1 w_2 + w_1 w_3 + \dots + w_6 w_7 = \frac{21}{2}.$  Squaring the equation $w_1 + w_2 + \dots + w_7 = -\frac{7}{2},$ we get
\[w_1^2 + w_2^2 + \dots + w_7^2 + 2(w_1 w_2 + w_1 w_3 + \dots + w_6 w_7) = \frac{49}{4}.\]Then
\[w_1^2 + w_2^2 + \dots + w_7^2 = \frac{49}{4} - 2(w_1 w_2 + w_1 w_3 + \dots + w_6 w_7) = \frac{49}{4} - 2 \cdot \frac{21}{2} = -\frac{35}{4}.\]Therefore,
\[\sum_{k = 1}^7 (-w_k - w_k^2) = \frac{7}{2} + \frac{35}{4} = \boxed{\frac{49}{4}}.\]
Since the root $\sqrt{3}-2$ is irrational but the coefficients of the quadratic are rational, from the quadratic formula we can see that the other root must be $-\sqrt{3}-2.$
To find the quadratic, we can note that the sum of the roots is $\sqrt{3}-2-\sqrt{3}-2=-4$ and the product is $(\sqrt{3}-2)(-\sqrt{3}-2) =4-3=1.$ Then by Vieta's formulas, we know that the quadratic $\boxed{x^2+4x+1}$ has $\sqrt{3}-2$ as a root.
Using the vertex and focus, we can see that the equation of the directrix must be $y = -1.$

Let $P = (x,y)$ be a point on the parabola
Then by definition of the parabola, $PF$ is equal to the distance from $P$ to the directrix, which is $y + 1.$  Hence,
\[\sqrt{x^2 + (y - 1)^2} = y + 1.\]Squaring, we get $x^2 + (y - 1)^2 = (y + 1)^2.$  This simplifies to $x^2 = 4y.$
We are given that $PF = 101,$ so $y + 1 = 101,$ and hence $y = 100.$  Then $x^2 = 400.$  Since the point is in the first quadrant, $x = 20.$  Hence, $P = \boxed{(20,100)}.$
Note that
\begin{align*}
-x + \sqrt{1 + (-x)^2} &= -x + \sqrt{1 + x^2} \\
&= \frac{(-x + \sqrt{1 + x^2})(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2})}{x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}} \\
&= \frac{-x^2 + (1 + x^2)}{x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}} \\
&= \frac{1}{x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}},
\end{align*}so
\begin{align*}
f(-x) &= \log (-x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}) \\
&= \log \left( \frac{1}{x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}} \right) \\
&= -\log (x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}) \\
&= -f(x).
\end{align*}Thus, $f(x)$ is an $\boxed{\text{odd}}$ function.
Cubing the given equation yields \[
1 = (1-x^3) + 3\sqrt[3]{(1-x^3)(1+x^3)}\left(\sqrt[3]{1-x^3} + \sqrt[3]{1+x^3}\right) + (1+x^3) = 2 + 3\sqrt[3]{1-x^6}.
\]Then $\frac{-1}{3} = \sqrt[3]{1-x^6},$ so $\frac{-1}{27} = 1-x^6$ and $x^6 = \boxed{\frac{28}{27}}.$
Any unit fraction whose denominator is the product of two consecutive numbers can be expressed as a difference of unit fractions as shown below
The second equation is the general rule.
$$\frac{1}{99\times100} = \frac{1}{99} - \frac{1}{100}$$$$\frac{1}{n(n+1)} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1}$$Each of the fractions in the given sum can be expressed as the difference of two unit fractions like so:
$$\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{6}\right)$$Observe that when the addition is performed, all terms but the first and last drop out
Therefore the sum is $1-\frac{1}{6}$ or $\boxed{\frac{5}{6}}$.
Since the coefficients of the polynomial are all real, the four non-real roots must come in two conjugate pairs
Let $z$ and $w$ be the two roots that multiply to $13+i$
Since $13+i$ is not real, $z$ and $w$ cannot be conjugates of each other (since any complex number times its conjugate is a real number)
Therefore, the other two roots must be $\overline{z}$ and $\overline{w}$, the conjugates of $z$ and $w$
Therefore, we have \[zw = 13+i \quad \text{and} \quad \overline{z} + \overline{w} = 3+4i.\]To find $b$, we use Vieta's formulas: $b$ equals the second symmetric sum of the roots, which is \[b = zw + z\overline{z} + z\overline{w} + w\overline{z} + w\overline{w} + \overline{z} \cdot \overline{w}.\]To evaluate this expression, we first recognize the terms $zw$ and $\overline{z} \cdot \overline{w}$
We have $zw = 13+i$, so $\overline{z} \cdot \overline{w} = \overline{zw} = 13-i$
Thus, \[b = 26 +  (z\overline{z} + z\overline{w} + w\overline{z} + w\overline{w}).\]To finish, we can factor the remaining terms by grouping: \[ b = 26 + (z+w)(\overline{z}+\overline{w}).\]From $\overline{z} + \overline{w} = 3+4i$, we get $z + w = 3-4i$
Thus, \[b = 26 + (3-4i)(3+4i) = \boxed{51}.\]
Using the identity $\log_{10}(x^2) = 2 \log_{10} x,$ the first equation simplifies to \[(\log_{10}x)^2 - 2\log_{10} x = 48.\]Subtracting $48$ from both sides gives a quadratic equation in $\log_{10} x,$ which factors as \[(\log_{10} x- 8)(\log_{10} x + 6) = 0.\]Since $x < 1,$ we have $\log_{10} x < 0,$ so we must choose the negative root, $\log_{10} x = -6.$ Then using the identity $\log_{10}(x^3) = 3 \log_{10} x$ gives the answer: \[\begin{aligned} (\log_{10}x)^3 - \log_{10}x^3 &= (\log_{10}x)^3 - 3\log_{10} x \\ &= (-6)^3 - 3(-6) \\ &= -216 + 18 \\ &= \boxed{-198}
\end{aligned}\]
By Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c = 7,$ $ab + ac + bc = 5,$ and $abc = -2.$
We can say
\[\frac{a}{bc + 1} + \frac{b}{ac + 1} + \frac{c}{ab + 1} = \frac{a^2}{abc + a} + \frac{b^2}{abc + b} + \frac{c^2}{abc + c}.\]Since $abc = -2,$ this becomes
\[\frac{a^2}{a - 2} + \frac{b^2}{b - 2} + \frac{c^2}{c - 2}.\]By Long Division, $\frac{x^2}{x - 2} = x + 2 + \frac{4}{x - 2},$ so
\begin{align*}
\frac{a^2}{a - 2} + \frac{b^2}{b - 2} + \frac{c^2}{c - 2} &= a + 2 + \frac{4}{a - 2} + b + 2 + \frac{4}{b - 2} + c + 2 + \frac{4}{c - 2} \\
&= a + b + c + 6 + 4 \left( \frac{1}{a - 2} + \frac{1}{b - 2} + \frac{1}{c - 2} \right) \\
&= 7 + 6 + 4 \cdot \frac{(b - 2)(c - 2) + (a - 2)(c - 2) + (a - 2)(b - 2)}{(a - 2)(b - 2)(c - 2)} \\
&= 13 + 4 \cdot \frac{(ab + ac + bc) - 4(a + b + c) + 12}{abc - 2(ab + ac + bc) + 4(a + b + c) - 8} \\
&= 13 + 4 \cdot \frac{5 - 4 \cdot 7 + 12}{-2 - 2 \cdot 5 + 4 \cdot 7 - 8} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{15}{2}}.
\end{align*}
Subtracting 1 from both sides and putting everything over a common denominator, we get
\[\frac{-x^2 + x + 6}{(x + 1)(x + 5)} \ge 0.\]Equivalently,
\[\frac{x^2 - x - 6}{(x + 1)(x + 5)} \le 0.\]We can factor the numerator, to get
\[\frac{(x - 3)(x + 2)}{(x + 1)(x + 5)} \le 0.\]We build a sign chart, accordingly.
\begin{tabular}{c|cccc|c} &$x-3$ &$x+2$ &$x+1$ &$x+5$ &$f(x)$ \\ \hline$x<-5$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$-5<x<-2$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$-2<x<-1$ &$-$&$+$&$-$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$-1<x<3$ &$-$&$+$&$+$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$x>3$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]\end{tabular}Also, note that $\frac{(x - 3)(x + 2)}{(x + 1)(x + 5)} = 0$ for $x = -2$ and $x = 3.$  Therefore, the solution is
\[x \in \boxed{(-5,-2] \cup (-1,3]}.\]
We know that $(a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2$
Therefore, we plug in the given values to get $5^2=35-2ab$
Solving, we get that $ab=5$
We also have the difference of cubes factorization $a^3-b^3=(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$
Plugging in the values given and solving, we get that $a^3-b^3=(5)(35+5)=(5)(40)=\boxed{200}$.
Since the parabola passes through the points $(0,0)$ and $(2T,0),$ the equation is of the form
\[y = ax(x - 2T).\]For the vertex, $x = T,$ and $y = aT(-T) = -aT^2.$  The sum of the coordinates of the vertex is then $N = T - aT^2.$
Setting $x = 2T + 1,$ we get $a(2T + 1) = 28.$  The possible values of $2T + 1$ are 7, $-1,$ and $-7.$  (We do not include 1, because $T \neq 0.$)  We compute the corresponding values of $T,$ $a,$ and $T - aT^2.$
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
2T + 1 & T & a & T - aT^2 \\ \hline
7 & 3 & 4 & -33 \\
-1 & -1 & -28 & 27 \\
-7 & -4 & -4 & 60
\end{array}
\]Hence, the largest possible value of $N$ is $\boxed{60}.$
Multiplying the first equation by $y$ and the second equation by $x,$ we get \[\begin{aligned} xy+1 &= 10y, \\ xy + 1 &= \tfrac{5}{12} x
\end{aligned}\]Then $10y = \tfrac{5}{12}x,$ so $y = \tfrac{1}{10} \cdot \tfrac{5}{12} x = \tfrac{1}{24}x.$ Substituting into the first equation, we get \[x + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{24}x} = 10,\]or $x + \frac{24}{x} = 10,$ which rearranges to the quadratic $x^2 - 10x + 24 = 0.$ This quadratic factors as $(x-4)(x-6) = 0,$ so the possible values for $x$ are $\boxed{4, 6}.$ (These give corresponding $y$-values $y = \tfrac16, \tfrac14,$ respectively, which, we can check, are valid solutions to the original system of equations.)
By the Rational Root Theorem, any root of the polynomial must divide $4$
Therefore the roots are among the numbers $\pm 1,2$
Since these are only four values, we can try all of them to find that that the roots are $\boxed{-1,2,-2}$.
By AM-HM,
\[\frac{a + b + b}{3} \ge \frac{3}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{b}},\]so
\[\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \ge \frac{9}{a + 2b} = 9.\]Equality occurs when $a = b = \frac{1}{3},$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{9}.$
We can write the expression as
\[\frac{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{1} \rfloor}{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{2} \rfloor} \cdot \frac{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{3} \rfloor}{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{4} \rfloor} \cdot \frac{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{5} \rfloor}{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{6} \rfloor} \dotsm \frac{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{2015} \rfloor}{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{2016} \rfloor}.\]For each fraction, the numerator and denominator will be equal (in which case they will cancel), except when the denominator involves a perfect fourth power
Hence, the product reduces to
\[\frac{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{15} \rfloor}{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{16} \rfloor} \cdot \frac{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{255} \rfloor}{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{256} \rfloor} \cdot \frac{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{1295} \rfloor}{\lfloor \sqrt[4]{1296} \rfloor} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \boxed{\frac{5}{16}}.\]
We see that $x = 0$ cannot be a root of the polynomial
Dividing both sides by $x^2,$ we get
\[x^2 + 2px + 1 + \frac{2p}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} = 0.\]Let $y = x + \frac{1}{x}.$  Then
\[y^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2},\]so
\[y^2 - 2 + 2py + 1 = 0,\]or $y^2 + 2py - 1 = 0.$  Hence,
\[p = \frac{1 - y^2}{2y}.\]If $x$ is negative, then by AM-GM,
\[y = x + \frac{1}{x} = -\left( -x + \frac{1}{-x} \right) \le -2 \sqrt{(-x) \cdot \frac{1}{-x}} = -2.\]Then
\[\frac{1 - y^2}{2y} - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{-2y^2 - 3y + 2}{4y} = -\frac{(y + 2)(2y - 1)}{4y} \ge 0.\]Therefore,
\[p = \frac{1 - y^2}{2y} \ge \frac{3}{4}.\]If $y = -2,$ then $x + \frac{1}{x} = -2.$  Then $x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x + 1)^2 = 0,$ so the only negative root is $-1,$ and the condition in the problem is not met
Therefore, $y < -2,$ and $p > \frac{3}{4}.$
On the other hand, assume $p > \frac{3}{4}.$  Then by the quadratic formula applied to $y^2 + 2py - 1 = 0,$
\[y = \frac{-2p \pm \sqrt{4p^2 + 4}}{2} = -p \pm \sqrt{p^2 + 1}.\]Since $p > \frac{3}{4},$
\begin{align*}
-p - \sqrt{p^2 + 1} &= -(p + \sqrt{p^2 + 1}) \\
&< -\left( \frac{3}{4} + \sqrt{\left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^2 + 1} \right) \\
&= -2.
\end{align*}In other words, one of the possible values of $y$ is less than $-2.$
Then from $y = x + \frac{1}{x},$
\[x^2 - yx + 1 = 0.\]By the quadratic formula,
\[x = \frac{y \pm \sqrt{y^2 - 4}}{2}.\]For the value of $y$ that is less than $-2,$ both roots are real
Furthermore, their product is 1, so they are both positive or both negative
The sum of the roots is $y,$ which is negative, so both roots are negative, and since $y^2 - 4 \neq 0,$ they are distinct.
Therefore, the value of $p$ that works are
\[p \in \boxed{\left( \frac{3}{4}, \infty \right)}.\]
We can write
\[\frac{xy}{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{1}{\frac{x^2 + y^2}{xy}} = \frac{1}{\frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x}}.\]Let $t = \frac{x}{y},$ so $\frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x} = t + \frac{1}{t}.$  We want to maximize this denominator.
\[f(t) = t + \frac{1}{t}.\]Suppose $0 < t < u.$  Then
\begin{align*}
f(u) - f(t) &= u + \frac{1}{u} - t - \frac{1}{t} \\
&= u - t + \frac{1}{u} - \frac{1}{t} \\
&= u - t + \frac{t - u}{tu} \\
&= (u - t) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{tu} \right) \\
&= \frac{(u - t)(tu - 1)}{tu}.
\end{align*}This means if $1 \le t < u,$ then
\[f(u) - f(t) = \frac{(u - t)(tu - 1)}{tu} > 0,\]so $f(u) > f(t).$  Hence, $f(t)$ is increasing on the interval $[1,\infty).$
On the other hand, if $0 \le t < u \le 1,$ then
\[f(u) - f(t) = \frac{(u - t)(tu - 1)}{tu} < 0,\]so $f(u) < f(t).$  Hence, $f(t)$ is decreasing on the interval $(0,1].$
So, to maximize $t + \frac{1}{t} = \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x},$ we should look at the extreme values of $\frac{x}{y},$ namely its minimum and maximum.
The minimum occurs at $x = \frac{2}{5}$ and $y = \frac{3}{8}.$  For these values,
\[\frac{xy}{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{240}{481}.\]The maximum occurs at $x = \frac{1}{2}$ and $y = \frac{1}{3}.$  For these values,
\[\frac{xy}{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{6}{13}.\]Thus, the minimum value is $\boxed{\frac{6}{13}}.$
The two axes of the ellipse are perpendicular bisectors of each other
Therefore, each endpoint of an axis must be equidistant from the two endpoints of the other axis
The only point of the given three which is equidistant from the other two is $(3, -2)$, so the fourth missing point must be the other endpoint of its axis, and the points $(-2, 4)$ and $(8, 4)$ must be endpoints of the same axis.
Then the center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment between $(-2,4)$ and $(8,4),$ which is the point $(3,4)$
This means that the semi-horizontal axis has length $8-3 = 5,$ and the semi-vertical axis has length $4-(-2) = 6.$ Thus, the distance between the foci is $2 \sqrt{6^2 - 5^2} =\boxed{2 \sqrt{11}}.$
Note that
\[(x^2 + 1)(x^8 - x^6 + x^4 - x^2 + 1) = x^{10} + 1.\]Also, $x^{10} + 1$ is a factor of $x^{2010} + 1$ via the factorization
\[a^n + b^n = (a + b)(a^{n - 1} - a^{n - 2} b + a^{n - 3} b^2 + \dots + b^{n - 1})\]where $n$ is odd, so $x^{10} + 1$ is a factor of $x^5 (x^{2010} + 1) = x^{2015} + x^5.$
So, when $x^{2015} + 1 = x^{2015} + x^5 + (-x^5 + 1)$ is divided by $x^8 - x^6 + x^4 - x^2 + 1,$ the remainder is $\boxed{-x^5 + 1}.$
Let Beta's scores be $a$ out of $b$ on day one and $c$ out of $d$ on day two, so that $0 < \frac{a}{b} < \frac{8}{15}$, $0 < \frac{c}{d} < \frac{7}{10}$, and $b+d=500$
Then $\frac{15}{8} a<b$ and $\frac{10}{7} c <d$, so
\[\frac{15}{8} a+ \frac{10}{7} c<b+d=500,\]and $21a+16c<5600$.
Beta's two-day success ratio is greatest when $a+c$ is greatest
Let $M=a+c$ and subtract $16M$ from both sides of the last inequality to obtain $5a<5600-16M$
Because $a>0$, conclude that $5600-16M>0$, and $M<350$
When $M=349$, $5a<16$, so $a\le3$.
If $a=3$, then $b\ge6$, but then $d\le494$ and $c=346$ so $\frac{c}{d} \ge \frac{346}{494} > \frac{7}{10}$
Notice that when $a=2$ and $b=4$, then $\frac{a}{b} < \frac{8}{15}$ and $\frac{c}{d} =\frac{347}{496} < \frac{7}{10}$
Thus Beta's maximum possible two-day success ratio is $\boxed{\frac{349}{500}}.$
Since only the even exponents have non-zero coefficients, $f$ is an even function, and we know that $f(-x) = f(x)$
Hence $f(-91) = f(91) = 1$ and $f(91) + f(-91) = 1+1 = \boxed{2}.$
Suppose the function $f(x) = 0$ has only one distinct root
If $x_1$ is a root of $f(f(x)) = 0,$ then we must have $f(x_1) = r_1.$  But the equation $f(x) = r_1$ has at most two roots
Therefore, the equation $f(x) = 0$ must have two distinct roots
Let them be $r_1$ and $r_2.$
Since $f(f(x)) = 0$ has three distinct roots, one of the equations $f(x) = r_1$ or $f(x) = r_2$ has one distinct root
Without loss generality, assume that $f(x) = r_1$ has one distinct root
Then $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c = r_1$ has one root
This means
\[x^2 + 6x + c - r_1\]must be equal to $(x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0,$ so $c - r_1 = 9.$  Hence, $r_1 = c - 9.$
Since $r_1$ is a root of $f(x) = 0,$
\[(c - 9)^2 + 6(c - 9) + c = 0.\]Expanding, we get $c^2 - 11c + 27 = 0,$ so
\[c = \frac{11 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2}.\]If $c = \frac{11 - \sqrt{13}}{2},$ then $r_1 = c - 9 = -\frac{7 + \sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $r_2 = -6 - r_1 = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{13}}{2},$ so
\[f(x) = x^2 + 6x + \frac{11 - \sqrt{13}}{2} = \left( x + \frac{7 + \sqrt{13}}{2} \right) \left( x + \frac{5 - \sqrt{13}}{2} \right) = (x + 3)^2 - \frac{7 + \sqrt{13}}{2}.\]The equation $f(x) = r_1$ has a double root of $x = -3,$ and the equation $f(x) = r_2$ has two roots, so $f(f(x)) = 0$ has exactly three roots.
If $c = \frac{11 + \sqrt{13}}{2},$ then $r_1 = c - 9 = \frac{-7 + \sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $r_2 = -6 - r_1 = -\frac{5 + \sqrt{13}}{2},$ and
\[f(x) = x^2 + 6x + \frac{11 + \sqrt{13}}{2} = \left( x + \frac{7 - \sqrt{13}}{2} \right) \left( x + \frac{5 + \sqrt{13}}{2} \right) = (x + 3)^2 + \frac{-7 + \sqrt{13}}{2}.\]The equation $f(x) = r_1$ has a double root of $x = -3,$ but the equation $f(x) = r_2$ has no real roots, so $f(f(x)) = 0$ has exactly one root.
Therefore, $c = \boxed{\frac{11 - \sqrt{13}}{2}}.$
Suppose that $y$ is a fixed number, and $x$ can vary
If we try to complete the square in $x,$ we would write
\[x^2 + (2y - 6) x + \dotsb,\]so the square would be of the form $(x + (y - 3))^2.$  Hence, for a fixed value of $y,$ the expression is minimized in $x$ for $x = 3 - y.$
Setting $x = 3 - y,$ we get
\begin{align*}
x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2 - 6x - 2y &= (3 - y)^2 + 2(3 - y)y + 3y^2 - 6(3 - y) - 2y \\
&= 2y^2 + 4y - 9 \\
&= 2(y + 1)^2 - 11.
\end{align*}Hence, the minimum value is $\boxed{-11},$ which occurs when $x = 4$ and $y = -1.$
We want the size of the set $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(f^{-1}(f^{-1}(3)))).$ Note that $f(x) = (x-1)^2-1 = 3$ has two solutions: $x=3$ and $x=-1$, and that the fixed points $f(x) = x$ are $x = 3$ and $x=0$
Therefore, the number of real solutions is equal to the number of distinct real numbers $c$ such that $c = 3$, $c=-1$, $f(c)=-1$ or $f(f(c))=-1$, or $f(f(f(c)))=-1$.
The equation $f(x) = -1$ has exactly one root $x = 1$
Thus, the last three equations are equivalent to $c = 1, f(c) = 1$, and $f(f(c))=1$
= 1$ has two solutions, $c = 1 \pm \sqrt{2}$, and for each of these two values $c$ there are two preimages
It follows that the answer is $1+1+1+2+4 = \boxed{9}$.
Let $r,$ $s,$ and $t$ be the roots of $f(x),$ so that $f(x)=(x-r)(x-s)(x-t)$
Then $r^2,$ $s^2,$ and $t^2$ are the roots of $g,$ so we can write \[g(x) = A(x-r^2)(x-s^2)(x-t^2)\]for some constant $A.$ Taking $x=0,$ we get \[-1 = -Ar^2s^2t^2.\]We know that $rst = -1$ by Vieta, so \[-1 = -A(-1)^2 = -A\]and $A=1.$ Then \[g(x) = (x-r^2)(x-s^2)(x-t^2),\]so \[g(9) = (9-r^2)(9-s^2)(9-t^2).\]To evaluate this product, we write
\begin{align*}
g(9) &= (3-r)(3+r)(3-s)(3+s)(3-t)(3+t) \\
&= (3-r)(3-s)(3-t)(3+r)(3+s)(3+t) \\
&= (3-r)(3-s)(3-t)[-(-3-r)(-3-s)(-3-t)] \\
&= f(3)\cdot -f(-3).
\end{align*}We know that $f(x) = (x-r)(x-s)(x-t),$ so in particular, $31 = f(3) = (3-r)(3-s)(3-t)$ and $-29 = f(-3) = (-3-r)(-3-s)(-3-t).$ Therefore, \[g(9) = f(3) \cdot -f(-3) = 31 \cdot 29 = \boxed{899}.\]
By the Trivial Inequality, $(x - y)^2 \ge 0$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y.$  We can re-arrange this as
\[xy \le \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}.\](This looks like AM-GM, but we need to establish it for all real numbers, not just nonnegative numbers.)
Hence,
\begin{align*}
&\cos \theta_1 \sin \theta_2 + \cos \theta_2 \sin \theta_3 + \cos \theta_3 \sin \theta_4 + \cos \theta_4 \sin \theta_5 + \cos \theta_5 \sin \theta_1 \\
&\le \frac{\cos^2 \theta_1 + \sin^2 \theta_2}{2} + \frac{\cos^2 \theta_2 + \sin^2 \theta_3}{2} \\
&\quad+ \frac{\cos^2 \theta_3 + \sin^2 \theta_4}{2} + \frac{\cos^2 \theta_4 + \sin^2 \theta_5}{2} + \frac{\cos^2 \theta_5 + \sin^2 \theta_1}{2} \\
&= \frac{\cos^2 \theta_1 + \sin^2 \theta_1}{2} + \frac{\cos^2 \theta_2 + \sin^2 \theta_2}{2} \\
&\quad+ \frac{\cos^2 \theta_3 + \sin^2 \theta_3}{2} + \frac{\cos^2 \theta_4 + \sin^2 \theta_4}{2} + \frac{\cos^2 \theta_5 + \sin^2 \theta_5}{2} \\
&= \frac{5}{2}.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when all the $\theta_i$ are equal to $45^\circ,$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{5}{2}}.$
Squaring the equation $a + b + c = 1,$ we get
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 1.\]Since $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2,$ $2ab + 2ac + 2bc = -1,$ so
\[ab + ac + bc = -\frac{1}{2}.\]Cubing the equation $a + b + c = 1,$ we get
\[(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 3(a^2 b + ab^2 + a^2 c + ac^2 + b^2 c + bc^2) + 6abc = 1.\]Since $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3,$
\[3(a^2 b + ab^2 + a^2 c + ac^2 + b^2 c + bc^2) + 6abc = -2
\quad (*)\]If we multiply the equations $a + b + c = 1$ and $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2,$ we get
\[(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + (a^2 b + ab^2 + a^2 c + ac^2 + b^2 c + bc^2) = 2.\]Then
\[a^2 b + ab^2 + a^2 c + ac^2 + b^2 c + bc^2 = -1.\]Then from equation $(*),$
\[-3 + 6abc = -2,\]so $abc = \frac{1}{6}.$
By Vieta's formulas, $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ are the roots of the equation $x^3 - x^2 - \frac{1}{2} x - \frac{1}{6} = 0.$  Hence,
\begin{align*}
a^3 - a^2 - \frac{1}{2} a - \frac{1}{6} &= 0, \\
b^3 - b^2 - \frac{1}{2} b - \frac{1}{6} &= 0, \\
c^3 - c^2 - \frac{1}{2} c - \frac{1}{6} &= 0.
\end{align*}Multiplying these equations by $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ respectively, we get
\begin{align*}
a^4 - a^3 - \frac{1}{2} a^2 - \frac{1}{6} a &= 0, \\
b^4 - b^3 - \frac{1}{2} b^2 - \frac{1}{6} b &= 0, \\
c^4 - c^3 - \frac{1}{2} c^2 - \frac{1}{6} c &= 0.
\end{align*}Adding these equations, we get
\[(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) - \frac{1}{2} (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - \frac{1}{6} (a + b + c) = 0,\]so
\[a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + \frac{1}{2} (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + \frac{1}{6} (a + b + c) = 3 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 + \frac{1}{6} \cdot 1 = \boxed{\frac{25}{6}}.\]
The definition gives $$a_3(a_2+1) = a_1+2009, \;\; a_4(a_3+1) = a_2+2009, \;\; a_5(a_4+1) = a_3 + 2009.$$Subtracting consecutive equations yields $a_3-a_1 = (a_3+1)(a_4-a_2)$ and $a_4-a_2=(a_4+1)(a_5-a_3)$.
Suppose that $a_3-a_1\neq 0$
Then $a_4-a_2\neq 0$, $a_5-a_3\neq 0$, and so on
Because $|a_{n+2}+1| \ge 2$, it follows that
\[0<|a_{n+3} - a_{n+1}| = \frac{|a_{n+2}-a_n|}{|a_{n+2}+1|} < |a_{n+2}-a_n|,\]Then
\[|a_3-a_1|>|a_4-a_2|>|a_5-a_3| > \dotsb,\]which is a contradiction.
Therefore, $a_{n+2}-a_n=0$ for all $n\ge 1$, which implies that all terms with an odd index are equal, and all terms with an even index are equal
Thus as long as $a_1$ and $a_2$ are integers, all the terms are integers
The definition of the sequence then implies that $a_1 = a_3 = \frac{a_1+2009}{a_2+1}$, giving $a_1a_2=2009=7^2\cdot 41$
The minimum value of $a_1+a_2$ occurs when $\{a_1,a_2\}=\{41,49\}$, which has a sum of $\boxed{90}$.
Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers
Since $|z| = \sqrt{2},$ $x^2 + y^2 = 2.$  Then
\begin{align*}
|z - 1| &= |x + yi - 1| \\
&= \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + y^2} \\
&= \sqrt{x^2 - 2x + 1 + 2 - x^2} \\
&= \sqrt{3 - 2x},
\end{align*}and
\begin{align*}
|z + 1| &= |x + yi + 1| \\
&= \sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + y^2} \\
&= \sqrt{x^2 + 2x + 1 + 2 - x^2} \\
&= \sqrt{2x + 3},
\end{align*}so
\[|(z - 1)^2 (z + 1)| = \sqrt{(3 - 2x)^2 (2x + 3)}.\]Thus, we want to maximize $(3 - 2x)^2 (2x + 3),$ subject to $-\sqrt{2} \le x \le \sqrt{2}.$
We claim the maximum occurs at $x = -\frac{1}{2}.$  At $x = -\frac{1}{2},$ $(3 - 2x)^2 (2x + 3) = 32.$  Note that
\[32 - (3 - 2x)^2 (2x + 3) = -8x^3 + 12x^2 + 18x + 5 = (2x + 1)^2 (5 - 2x) \ge 0,\]so $(3 - 2x)^2 (2x + 3) \le 32$ for $-\sqrt{2} \le x \le \sqrt{2},$ with equality if and only if $x = -\frac{1}{2}.$
Therefore, the maximum value of $|(z - 1)^2 (z + 1)| = \sqrt{(3 - 2x)^2 (2x + 3)}$ is $\sqrt{32} = \boxed{4 \sqrt{2}}.$
By QM-AM,
\[\frac{\sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x}}{2} \le \sqrt{\frac{25 + x + 25 - x}{2}} = 5,\]so $\sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x} \le 10.$
Equality occurs at $x = 0,$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{10}.$
Note that $$f(600) = f \left( 500 \cdot \frac{6}{5} \right) = \frac{f(500)}{6/5} = \frac{3}{6/5} = \boxed{\frac{5}{2}}.$$$$\textbf{OR}$$For all positive $x$, $$f(x) = f(1\cdot x) = \frac{f(1)}{x},$$so $xf(x)$ is the constant $f(1)$
Therefore, $$600f(600) = 500f(500) = 500(3) = 1500,$$so $f(600) = \frac{1500}{600} = \boxed{\frac{5}{2}}$.
Note: $f(x) = \frac{1500}{x}$ is the unique function satisfying the given conditions.
$$S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{3n-1}{2^n} = \frac{2}{2} + \frac{5}{4} + \frac{8}{8} + \frac{11}{16} + \dotsb.$$Then
$$2S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{3n-1}{2^{n+1}} = 2 + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{8}{4} + \frac{11}{8} + \dotsb.$$Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us
$$S = 2 + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{8} + \dots = 2 + \frac{\frac{3}{2}}{1-\frac{1}{2}} = 2 + 3 = \boxed{5} .$$
Our strategy is to take $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ and divide into several expression, apply AM-GM to each expression, and come up with a multiple of $2xy \sqrt{6} + 8yz.$
Since we want terms of $xy$ and $yz$ after applying AM-GM, we divide $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ into
\[(x^2 + ky^2) + [(1 - k)y^2 + z^2].\]By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
x^2 + ky^2 &\ge 2 \sqrt{(x^2)(ky^2)} = 2xy \sqrt{k}, \\
(1 - k)y^2 + z^2 &\ge 2 \sqrt{((1 - k)y^2)(z^2)} = 2yz \sqrt{1 - k}.
\end{align*}To get a multiple of $2xy \sqrt{6} + 8yz,$ we want $k$ so that
\[\frac{2 \sqrt{k}}{2 \sqrt{6}} = \frac{2 \sqrt{1 - k}}{8}.\]Then
\[\frac{\sqrt{k}}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{\sqrt{1 - k}}{4}.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[\frac{k}{6} = \frac{1 - k}{16}.\]Solving for $k,$ we find $k = \frac{3}{11}.$
\begin{align*}
x^2 + \frac{3}{11} y^2 &\ge 2xy \sqrt{\frac{3}{11}}, \\
\frac{8}{11} y^2 + z^2 &\ge 2yz \sqrt{\frac{8}{11}} = 4yz \sqrt{\frac{2}{11}},
\end{align*}so
\[1 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \ge 2xy \sqrt{\frac{3}{11}} + 4yz \sqrt{\frac{2}{11}}.\]Multiplying by $\sqrt{11},$ we get
\[2xy \sqrt{3} + 4yz \sqrt{2} \le \sqrt{11}.\]Multiplying by $\sqrt{2},$ we get
\[2xy \sqrt{6} + 8yz \le \sqrt{22}.\]Equality occurs when $x = y \sqrt{\frac{3}{11}}$ and $y \sqrt{\frac{8}{11}} = z.$  Using the condition $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1,$ we can solve to get $x = \sqrt{\frac{3}{22}},$ $y = \sqrt{\frac{11}{22}},$ and $z = \sqrt{\frac{8}{22}}.$  Therefore, the maximum value is $\boxed{\sqrt{22}}.$
We have that
\[Q(\sqrt{3}) = a_0 + a_1 \sqrt{3} + 3a_2 + 3a_3 \sqrt{3} + \dotsb = 20 + 17 \sqrt{3},\]so
\begin{align*}
a_0 + 3a_2 + 9a_4 + 81a_6 + \dotsb &= 20, \\
a_1 + 3a_3 + 9a_5 + 81a_7 + \dotsb &= 17.
\end{align*}Since $0 \le a_i < 3,$ the problem reduces to expressing 20 and 17 in base 3
Since $20 = 2 \cdot 9 + 0 \cdot 3 + 2$ and $17 = 9 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2,$
\[Q(x) = x^5 + 2x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x + 2.\]In particular, $Q(2) = \boxed{86}.$
Recall that a parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus $F$ and the directrix
Completing the square on $x,$ we get
\[y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3.\]To make the algebra a bit easier, we can find the focus of the parabola $y = -3x^2,$ shift the parabola left by 1 unit to get $y = -3(x + 1)^2,$ and then shift it upward 3 units to find the focus of the parabola $y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3.$
Since the parabola $y = -3x^2$ is symmetric about the $y$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(0,f).$  Let $y = d$ be the equation of the directrix.

Let $(x,-3x^2)$ be a point on the parabola $y = -3x^2.$  Then
\[PF^2 = x^2 + (-3x^2 - f)^2\]and $PQ^2 = (-3x^2 - d)^2.$  Thus,
\[x^2 + (-3x^2 - f)^2 = (-3x^2 - d)^2.\]Expanding, we get
\[x^2 + 9x^4 + 6fx^2 + f^2 = 9x^4 + 6dx^2 + d^2.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
1 + 6f &= 6d, \\
f^2 &= d^2.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $d - f = \frac{1}{6}.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $-2f = \frac{1}{6},$ so $f = -\frac{1}{12}.$
Thus, the focus of $y = -3x^2$ is $\left( 0, -\frac{1}{12} \right),$ and the focus of $y = -3(x + 1)^2$ is $\left( -1, -\frac{1}{12} \right),$ so the focus of $y = -3(x - 1)^2 + 3$ is $\boxed{\left( -1, \frac{35}{12} \right)}.$
Notice that we can factor out a $5x$ from each term on the left-hand side to give $5x(x+2y)$
Similarly, we can factor out an $x^2$ from each term on the right-hand side to give $x^2(x+2y)$
Thus, we have $5x(x+2y) = x^2(x+2y)$
Since $x$ and $y$ are positive, we can safely divide both sides by $x(x+2y),$ which gives $x = \boxed{5}$.
The graph of $y = f(-x)$ is the reflection of the graph of $y = f(x)$ in the $y$-axis
The correct graph is $\boxed{\text{E}}.$
Let $x = 29.$ Then we can write \[\begin{aligned} (31)(30)(29)(28) + 1 &= (x+2)(x+1)(x)(x-1) + 1 \\ &= [(x+2)(x-1)][(x+1)x] - 1 \\& = (x^2+x-2)(x^2+x) + 1 \\&= (x^2+x)^2 - 2(x^2+x) + 1 \\&= (x^2+x-1)^2
\end{aligned} \]Therefore, the answer is \[ \begin{aligned} x^2+x-1&= 29^2 + 29 - 1\\& = \boxed{869}
\end{aligned}\]
Since $g(x)$ is divisible by $x-4$, we have $g(4)=0$
We also have
\begin{align*}
g(4) &= 4^3 - 4^2 - (m^2+m)(4) + 2m^2+4m+2 \\
&= 50 - 2m^2,
\end{align*}so $0=50-2m^2$
Thus $m$ can only be $5$ or $-5$
We check both possibilities.
If $m=5$, then $g(x)=x^3-x^2-30x+72=(x-4)(x^2+3x-18)=(x-4)(x+6)(x-3)$, so all zeroes are integers.
If $m=-5$, then $g(x)=x^3-x^2-20x+32=(x-4)(x^2+3x-8)$, but $x^2+3x-8$ does not have integer zeroes.
Therefore, the only solution is $m=\boxed{5}$.
Setting $m = n = 0,$ we get
\[2f(0) = f(0),\]so $f(0) = 0.$
Setting $n = 0,$ we get
\[2f(m) = \frac{f(2m)}{2}.\]Thus, we can write the given functional equation as
\[f(m + n) + f(m - n) = 2f(m) + 2f(n).\]In particular, setting $n = 1,$ we get
\[f(m + 1) + f(m - 1) = 2 + 2f(m),\]so
\[f(m + 1) = 2f(m) - f(m - 1) + 2\]for all $m \ge 1.$
\begin{align*}
f(2) &= 2f(1) - f(0) + 2 = 4, \\
f(3) &= 2f(2) - f(1) + 2 = 9, \\
f(4) &= 2f(3) - f(2) + 2 = 16,
\end{align*}and so on.
By a straight-forward induction argument,
\[f(m) = m^2\]for all nonnegative integers $m.$  Note that this function satisfies the given functional equation, so the sum of all possible values of $f(10)$ is $\boxed{100}.$
Let $A = x + y + z,$ $B = x^2 + y^2 + z^2,$ and $C = xy + xz + yz.$  We are told that
\[4A = B.\]Then
\[A^2 = (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + xz + yz) = B + 2C = 4A + 2C.\]Hence,
\[C = \frac{1}{2} (A - 2)^2 - 2.\]Also,
\[B - C = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (xy + xz + yz) = \frac{(x - y)^2 + (x - z)^2 + (y - z)^2}{2} \ge 0,\]so $C \le B.$  Then $A^2 = B + 2C \le 3B = 12A.$  Hence, $0 \le A \le 12,$ so $-2 \le C \le 48.$
We see that $C = -2$ when $(x,y,z) = (2,-\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2}),$ and $C = 48$ when $(x,y,z) = (4,4,4),$ so $M = 48$ and $m = -2,$ and $M + 10m = \boxed{28}.$
Let $y$ be a number in the range of $f.$ This means that there is a real number $x$ such that \[y = \frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.\]Multiplying both sides by $x^2-x+1$ and rearranging, we get the equation \[yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0.\]Since $x^2-x+1 = (x-\tfrac12)^2 + \tfrac34 > 0$ for all $x,$ our steps are reversible, so $y$ is in the range of $f$ if and only if this equation has a real solution for $x.$ In turn, this equation has a real solution for $x$ if and only if the discriminant of this quadratic is nonnegative
Therefore, the range of $f$ consists exactly of the values of $y$ which satisfy \[(y+1)^2 - 4y^2 \ge 0,\]or \[0 \ge 3y^2 - 2y - 1.\]This quadratic factors as \[0 \ge (3y+1)(y-1),\]which means that the solutions to the inequality are given by $-\tfrac13 \le y \le 1.$ Therefore, the range of $g$ is the closed interval $\boxed{[-\tfrac13, 1]}.$
We have that
\[M = \max \{a + b, b + c, c + d, d + e\}.\]In particular, $a + b \le M,$ $b + c \le M,$ and $d + e \le M.$  Since $b$ is a positive integer, $c < M.$  Hence,
\[(a + b) + c + (d + e) < 3M.\]Then $2010 < 3M,$ so $M > 670.$  Since $M$ is an integer, $M \ge 671.$
Equality occurs if $a = 669,$ $b = 1,$ $c = 670,$ $d = 1,$ and $e = 669,$ so the smallest possible value of $M$ is $\boxed{671}.$
First, we simplify $\sqrt{21 + 12 \sqrt{3}}.$  Let
\[\sqrt{21 + 12 \sqrt{3}} = x + y.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[21 + 12 \sqrt{3} = x^2 + 2xy + y^2.\]To make the right-hand side look like the left-hand side, we set $x^2 + y^2 = 21$ and $2xy = 12 \sqrt{3},$ so $xy = 6 \sqrt{3}.$  Then $x^2 y^2 = 108,$ so by Vieta's formulas, $x^2$ and $y^2$ are the roots of the quadratic
\[t^2 - 21t + 108 = 0.\]This factors as $(t - 9)(t - 12) = 0,$ whose solutions are 9 and 12
Therefore,
\[\sqrt{21 + 12 \sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{9} + \sqrt{12} = 3 + 2 \sqrt{3}.\]Now we must simplify
\[\sqrt{1 + 3 + 2 \sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{4 + 2 \sqrt{3}}.\]Performing the same technique gives us
\[\sqrt{4 + 2 \sqrt{3}} = 1 + \sqrt{3},\]so $(a,b) = \boxed{(1,3)}.$
First, we can write
\[\frac{3x^2 + 9x + 17}{3x^2 + 9x + 7} = \frac{(3x^2 + 9x + 7) + 10}{3x^2 + 9x + 7} = 1 + \frac{10}{3x^2 + 9x + 7}.\]Thus, we want to minimize $3x^2 + 9x + 7.$
Completing the square, we get
\[3x^2 + 9x + 7 = 3 \left( x + \frac{3}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{4},\]so the minimum value of $3x^2 + 9x + 7$ is $\frac{1}{4}.$
Therefore, the maximum integer value of
\[1 + \frac{10}{3x^2 + 9x + 7}\]is $1 + \frac{10}{1/4} = \boxed{41}.$
We can write the quadratic as
\[4x^2 + (a + 8)x + 9 = 0.\]If the quadratic has one solution, then its discriminant must be zero:
\[(a + 8)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 9 = 0.\]Expanding, we get $a^2 + 16a - 80 = 0.$  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $\boxed{-16}.$
Note that from $\frac{4}{7}$ to $\frac{50}{53},$ the numerator of each fraction cancels with the denominator of the fraction three terms before it
Thus, the product simplifies to  \[\frac{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3}{51\cdot 52\cdot 53 }= \boxed{\frac{1}{23426}}.\]
The given equation rewrites as $n^2 = (x+y+z+1)^2+(x+y+z+1)-8$
Writing $r = x+y+z+1$, we have $n^2 = r^2+r-8$
Clearly, one possibility is $n=r=\boxed{8}$, which is realized by $x=y=1, z=6$
On the other hand, for $r > 8$, we have $r^2 < r^2+r-8 < (r+1)^2.$
Setting $x = 10$ and $y=5$ gives $f(10) + f(25) + 250 = f(25) + 200 + 1$, from which we get $f(10) = \boxed{-49}$.
$\text{Remark:}$ By setting $y = \frac x 2$, we see that the function is $f(x) = -\frac 1 2 x^2 + 1$, and it can be checked that this function indeed satisfies the given equation.
Apply the sum of cubes factorization to the expression $1000x^3+27 = (10x)^3+3^3$ to obtain  \[
1000x^3+27 = (10x+3)(100x^2-30x+9).
\]Thus $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+e^2+f^2=0^2+10^2+3^2+100^2+(-30)^2+9^2=\boxed{11,\!090}$
Note that the fundamental theorem of algebra implies that the factorization we have given is unique, since the discriminant $(-30)^2-4(100)(9)$ of the quadratic $100x^2-30x+9$ is negative.
For $k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n,$ let $P_k = (k^2,a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k).$ Note that $P_0 = (0,0)$ and $P_n = (n^2,a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n) = (n^2,17).$

Then for each $k = 1, 2, \ldots, n,$ we have \[\begin{aligned} P_{k-1}P_k &= \sqrt{(k^2-(k-1)^2)+((a_1+a_2+\dots+a_{k-1}+a_{k})-(a_1+a_2+\dots+a_{k-1}))^2} \\ &= \sqrt{(2k-1)^2+a_k^2}, \end{aligned}\]so that $S_n$ is the minimum value of the sum $P_0P_1 + P_1P_2 + \dots + P_{n-1}P_n.$ By the triangle inequality, \[P_0P_1 + P_1P_2 + \dots + P_{n-1}P_n \ge P_0P_n = \sqrt{n^4 + 289}.\]Furthemore, equality occurs when all the $P_i$ are collinear, so $S_n = \sqrt{n^4+289}$ for each $n.$
It remains to find the $n$ for which $S_n$ is an integer, or equivalently, $n^4+289$ is a perfect square
Let $n^4+289=m^2$ for some positive integer $m.$ Then $m^2-n^4=289,$ which factors as \[(m-n^2)(m+n^2) = 289.\]Since $n^2$ is positive and $289 = 17^2,$ the only possibility is $m-n^2=1$ and $m+n^2=289,$ giving $m = 145$ and $n^2 = 144.$ Thus $n = \sqrt{144} = \boxed{12}.$
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(y + z - 2) + (z + x - 4) + (x + y - 6)] \left[ \frac{(x + 2)^2}{y + z - 2} + \frac{(y + 4)^2}{z + x - 4} + \frac{(z + 6)^2}{x + y - 6} \right] \ge [(x + 2) + (y + 4) + (z + 6)]^2.\]This simplifies to
\[36(2x + 2y + 2z - 12) \ge (x + y + z + 12)^2.\]Let $s = x + y + z.$  Then $36(2s - 12) \ge (s + 12)^2.$  This simplifies to $s^2 - 48s + 576 \le 0,$ which then factors as $(s - 24)^2 \le 0.$  Hence, $s = 24.$
Thus, the inequality above turns into an equality, which means
\[\frac{x + 2}{y + z - 2} = \frac{y + 4}{z + x - 4} = \frac{z + 6}{x + y - 6}.\]Since $x + y + z = 24,$
\[\frac{x + 2}{22 - x} = \frac{y + 4}{20 - y} = \frac{z + 6}{18 - z}.\]Each fraction must then be equal to
\[\frac{(x + 2) + (y + 4) + (z + 6)}{(22 - x) + (20 - y) + (18 - z)} = \frac{x + y + z + 12}{60 - (x + y + z)} = 1.\]From here, it is easy to solve for $x,$ $y,$ and $z,$ to find $x = 10,$ $y = 8,$ and $z = 6.$
Hence, $(x,y,z) = \boxed{(10,8,6)}.$
Plotting $y = |x - 3|$ and $y = 4 - |x - 1|,$ we find that the two graphs intersect at $(0,3)$ and $(4,1).$

The region then is a rectangle with side lengths $\sqrt{2}$ and $3 \sqrt{2},$ so its area is $(\sqrt{2})(3 \sqrt{2}) = \boxed{6}.$
Let $A$ be the perigee, let $B$ be the apogee, let $F$ be the focus where the sun is, let $O$ be the center of the ellipse, and let $M$ be the current position of Xavier.
unitsize(1 cm);
pair A, B, F, M, O;
path ell = xscale(2)*Circle((0,0),1);
A = (-2,0);
B = (2,0);
F = (-sqrt(3),0);
O = (0,0);
M = (0,-1);

Then $AB$ is a major axis of the ellipse, and $AB = 2 + 12 = 14.$  Since $M$ is the midway point, $MF = AO = \frac{14}{2} = \boxed{7}.$
By Vieta's formulas, \[\left\{ \begin{aligned} a + b + c &= 0 \\ ab+bc+ac&=-2011
\end{aligned} \right.\]Since $a+b=-c,$ the second equation becomes $ab+(-c)c = -2011$, or \[c^2 - ab= 2011.\]At least two of $a, b, c$ must have the same sign; without loss of generality, let $a$ and $b$ have the same sign
Furthermore, since we can negate all of $a, b, c$ and still satisfy the two above equations, assume that $c \ge 0.$ (Note that we only want the sum $|a| + |b| + |c|$, which does not change if we swap or negate the variables.)
Now, we have $ab \ge 0,$ so $c^2 \ge 2011$, giving $c \ge 44.$ We also have \[\frac{c^2}{4} = \left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^2 \ge ab\]by AM-GM, so $2011 = c^2 - ab \ge 3c^2/4,$ giving $c \le 51.$
Finally, we have $(a-b)^2 = (a+b)^2 - 4ab = (-c)^2 - 4(c^2-2011) = 8044 - 3c^2$, which must be a perfect square.
Testing $c = 44, 45, \ldots, 51$, we find that $8044 - 3c^2$ is a perfect square only when $c = 49$
Therefore, $c = 49$, and so \[\left\{ \begin{aligned} a+b&= -c = -49, \\ ab &= c^2 - 2011 = 390
\end{aligned} \right.\]Thus, $a$ and $b$ are the roots of $t^2 + 49t + 390 = 0$, which factors as $(t+10)(t+39) = 0$
Thus, $\{a, b\} = \{-10, -39\}$.
The answer is \[|a| + |b| + |c| = 39 + 10 + 49 = \boxed{98}.\]
From the given equations, $y + z = 4 - x$ and $y^2 + z^2 = 6 - x^2.$  By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(1 + 1)(y^2 + z^2) \ge (y + z)^2.\]Hence, $2(6 - x^2) \ge (4 - x)^2.$  This simplifies to $3x^2 - 8x + 4 \le 0,$ which factors as $(x - 2)(3x - 2) \le 0.$  Hence, $\frac{2}{3} \le x \le 2.$
For $x = \frac{3}{2},$ we can take $y = z = \frac{5}{3}.$  For $x = 2,$ we can take $y = z = 1.$  Thus, $m = \frac{2}{3}$ and $M = 2,$ so $m + M = \boxed{\frac{8}{3}}.$
First, we divide both sides by 7, to get
\[\frac{x^2}{140} + \frac{y^2}{28} = 1.\]Thus, $a^2 = 140$ and $b^2 = 28,$ so $c^2 = a^2 - b^2 = 140 - 28 = 112.$  Thus, $c = \sqrt{112} = 4 \sqrt{7},$ so the distance between the foci is $2c = \boxed{8 \sqrt{7}}.$
First, we consider a particular line, $y = x - 1,$ which passes through $F.$  Substituting, we get
\[\frac{x^2}{2} + (x - 1)^2 = 1.\]This simplifies to $3x^2 - 4x = x(3x - 4) = 0,$ so $x = 0$ or $x = \frac{4}{3}.$  Thus, we can let $A = \left( \frac{4}{3}, \frac{1}{3} \right)$ and $B = (0,-1).$
The slope of line $AP$ is then $\frac{1/3}{4/3 - p} = \frac{1}{4 - 3p},$ and the slope of line $BP$ is $\frac{-1}{-p} = \frac{1}{p}.$  Since $\angle APF = \angle BPF,$ these slopes are negatives of each other, so
\[\frac{1}{3p - 4} = \frac{1}{p}.\]Then $p = 3p - 4,$ so $p = \boxed{2}.$
For a complete solution, we prove that this works for all chords $\overline{AB}$ that pass through $F.$  Let $A = (x_a,y_a)$ and $B = (x_b,y_b).$  Then the condition $\angle APF = \angle BPF$ is equivalent to
\[\frac{y_a}{x_a - 2} + \frac{y_b}{x_b - 2} = 0,\]or $y_a (x_b - 2) + y_b (x_a - 2) = 0.$  Then $y_a x_b - 2y_a + y_b x_a - 2y_b = 0.$
Let $y = m(x - 1)$ be the equation of line $AB.$  Substituting, we get
\[\frac{x^2}{2} + m^2 (x - 1)^2 = 1.\]This simplifies to $(2m^2 + 1) x^2 - 4m^2 x + 2m^2 - 2 = 0.$  By Vieta's formulas,
\[x_a + x_b = \frac{4m^2}{2m^2 + 1} \quad \text{and} \quad x_a x_b = \frac{2m^2 - 2}{2m^2 + 1}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
y_a x_b - 2y_a + y_b x_a - 2y_b &= m(x_a - 1) x_b - 2m(x_a - 1) + m(x_b - 1) x_a - 2m(x_b - 1) \\
&= 2mx_a x_b - 3m (x_a + x_b) + 4m \\
&= 2m \cdot \frac{2m^2 - 2}{2m^2 + 1} - 3m \cdot \frac{4m^2}{2m^2 + 1} + 4m \\
\end{align*}Thus, $\angle APF = \angle BPF$ for all chords $\overline{AB}$ that pass through $F.$
Let $b_n = 19 \log_2 a_n.$  Then $a_n = 2^{\frac{b_n}{19}},$ so
\[2^{\frac{b_n}{19}} = 2^{\frac{b_{n - 1}}{19}} \cdot 2^{\frac{2b_{n - 2}}{19}} = 2^{\frac{b_{n - 1} + 2b_{n - 2}}{19}},\]which implies
\[b_n = b_{n - 1} + 2b_{n - 2}.\]Also, $b_0 = 0$ and $b_1 = 1.$
We want
\[a_1 a_2 \dotsm a_k = 2^{\frac{b_1 + b_2 + \dots + b_k}{19}}\]to be an integer
In other words, we want $b_1 + b_2 + \dots + b_k$ to be a multiple of 19.
So, let $s_k = b_1 + b_2 + \dots + b_k.$  Using the recurrence $b_n = b_{n - 1} + 2b_{n - 2},$ we can compute the first few terms of $(b_n)$ and $(s_n)$ modulo 19:
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
n & b_n & s_n \\ \hline
1 & 1 & 1 \\
2 & 1 & 2 \\
3 & 3 & 5 \\
4 & 5 & 10 \\
5 & 11 & 2 \\
6 & 2 & 4 \\
7 & 5 & 9 \\
8 & 9 & 18 \\
9 & 0 & 18 \\
10 & 18 & 17 \\
11 & 18 & 16 \\
12 & 16 & 13 \\
13 & 14 & 8 \\
14 & 8 & 16 \\
15 & 17 & 14 \\
16 & 14 & 9 \\
17 & 10 & 0
\end{array}
\]Thus, the smallest such $k$ is $\boxed{17}.$
Alternatively, we can solve the recursion $b_0 = 0,$ $b_1 = 1,$ $b_n = b_{n - 1} + 2b_{n - 2}$ to get
\[b_n = \frac{2^n - (-1)^n}{3}.\]
By Cauchy-Schwarz
\[\left( \frac{49}{4} + 4 + 4 \right) (4x^2 + y^2 + 16z^2) \ge (7x + 2y + 8z)^2.\]Since $4x^2 + y^2 + 16z^2 = 1,$
\[(7x + 2y + 8z)^2 \le \frac{81}{4}.\]Hence, $7x + 2y + 8z \le \frac{9}{2}.$
For equality to occur, we must have $\frac{2x}{7/2} = \frac{y}{2} = \frac{4z}{2}$ and $4x^2 + y^2 + 16z^2 = 1.$  We can solve, to find $x = \frac{7}{18},$ $y = \frac{4}{9},$ and $z = \frac{1}{9},$ so the maximum value of $7x + 2y + 8z$ is $\boxed{\frac{9}{2}}.$
The expression inside the square root must be greater than 0 because the denominator cannot be equal to 0
Therefore, $x-1>0$, so $x>1$
The expression inside the logarithm must be greater than 0, so $3-x>0$, which gives $x<3$
Therefore, the interval of $x$ for which the expression $\frac{\log{(3-x)}}{\sqrt{x-1}}$ is defined is $1<x<3$, which is $\boxed{(1,3)}$.
By AM-GM,
\[6a^3 + 9b^3 + 32c^3 \ge 3 \sqrt[3]{6a^3 \cdot 9b^3 \cdot 32c^3} = 36abc.\]Again by AM-GM,
\[36abc + \frac{1}{4abc} \ge 2 \sqrt{36abc \cdot \frac{1}{4abc}} = 6.\]Equality occurs when $6a^3 = 9b^3 = 32c^3$ and $36abc = 3.$  We can solve, to get $a = \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{6}},$ $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{9}},$ and $c = \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{32}}.$  Therefore, the minimum value is $\boxed{6}.$
There must be some polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $$P(x)-a=(x-1)(x-3)(x-5)(x-7)Q(x).$$Then, plugging in values of $2,4,6,8,$ we get
$$P(2)-a=(2-1)(2-3)(2-5)(2-7)Q(2) = -15Q(2) = -2a,$$$$P(4)-a=(4-1)(4-3)(4-5)(4-7)Q(4) = 9Q(4) = -2a,$$$$P(6)-a=(6-1)(6-3)(6-5)(6-7)Q(6) = -15Q(6) = -2a,$$$$P(8)-a=(8-1)(8-3)(8-5)(8-7)Q(8) = 105Q(8) = -2a.$$That is,
$$-2a=-15Q(2)=9Q(4)=-15Q(6)=105Q(8).$$Thus, $a$ must be a multiple of $\text{lcm}(15,9,15,105)=315$.
Now we show that there exists $Q(x)$ such that $a=315.$ Inputting this value into the above equation gives us
$$Q(2)=42, \quad Q(4)=-70, \quad Q(6)=42, \quad Q(8)=-6.$$From $Q(2) = Q(6) = 42,$ $Q(x)=R(x)(x-2)(x-6)+42$ for some $R(x).$  We can take $R(x) = -8x + 60,$ so that $Q(x)$ satisfies both $Q(4) = -70$ and $Q(8) = -6.$
Therefore, our answer is $ \boxed{ 315}
Adding the equations, we get
\[ab + ac + bc + 4(a + b + c) = -48.\]Multiplying the equations by $c,$ $a,$ $b,$ respectively, we get
\begin{align*}
abc + 4bc &= -16c, \\
abc + 4ac &= -16a, \\
abc + 4ab &= -16b.
\end{align*}Adding all these equations, we get
\[3abc + 4(ab + ac + bc) = -16(a + b + c).\]Then
\begin{align*}
3abc &= -4(ab + ac + bc) - 16(a + b +c) \\
&= -4(ab + ac + bc + 4(a + b + c)) \\
&= (-4)(-48) = 192,
\end{align*}so $abc = \boxed{64}.$
Because the coefficients of the polynomial are rational, the radical conjugate of $5-\sqrt{2},$ which is $5+\sqrt{2},$ must also be a root of the polynomial
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this polynomial is $0$; since $(5-\sqrt2) + (5+\sqrt2) = 10,$ the third, integer root must be $0 - 10 = \boxed{-10}.$
The fact that the function can be simplified to a quadratic means we can probably divide $(x+2)$ out of the numerator after factoring the numerator into $(x+2)$ and the quadratic $Ax^2+Bx+C$
Using long division or synthetic division, we find that the numerator breaks down into $(x+2)$ and $(x^2+6x+9)$.
Now, we have
\[y=\frac{(x+2)(x^2+6x+9)}{x+2}.\]After we divide out the $x+2$, we're left with $x^2+6x+9$, so $A=1$, $B=6$, and $C=9$.
The domain of the quadratic function is all real numbers, but our original function was undefined when the denominator $x+2$ equaled 0
After dividing out the $x+2$ we still have to take into account that the function is undefined at $x+2=0$
So, the function is not defined at $x=-2$, giving us our value for $D$.
Therefore, $A+B+C+D=1+6+9+(-2)=\boxed{14}$.
Setting $x = 3$ and $y = \frac{3}{2},$ we get
\[f \left( \frac{3}{2} \right) = f(3) f \left( \frac{3}{2} \right).\]Since $f \left( \frac{3}{2} \right) \neq 0,$ we can divide both sides by $f \left( \frac{3}{2} \right),$ to get $f(3) = \boxed{1}.$
Let $y = \sqrt[4]{x}.$ Then we have $y = \frac{12}{7-y},$ or $y(7-y) = 12.$ Rearranging and factoring, we get \[(y-3)(y-4) = 0.\]Therefore, $y = 3$ or $y = 4.$ Since $x = y^4,$ we have $x = 3^4 = 81$ or $x = 4^4 = 256,$ so the values for $x$ are $x = \boxed{81, 256}.$
Note that
\[(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)^2 = 16 = (a + b + c + d)(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3),\]which gives us the equality case in the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
Hence,
\[(a + b + c + d)(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3) - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)^2 = 0.\]This expands as
\begin{align*}
&a^3 b - 2a^2 b^2 + ab^3 + a^3 c - 2a^2 c^2 + ac^3 + a^3 d - 2a^2 d^2 + ad^2 \\
&\quad + b^3 c - 2b^2 c^2 + bc^3 + b^3 d - 2b^2 d^2 + bd^3 + c^3 d - 2c^2 d^2 + cd^3 = 0.
\end{align*}We can write this as
\[ab(a - b)^2 + ac(a - c)^2 + ad(a - d)^2 + bc(b - c)^2 + bd(b - d)^2 + cd(c - d)^2 = 0.\]Since $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ are all nonnegative, each term must be equal to 0
This means for any two variables among $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d,$ either one of them is 0, or they are equal
(For example, either $b = 0,$ $d = 0,$ or $b = d.$)  In turn, this means that among $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d,$ all the positive values must be equal.
Each variable $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ can be 0 or positive, leading to $2^4 = 16$ possible combinations
However, since $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4,$ not all of them can be equal to 0, leaving $16 - 1 = 15$ possible combinations.
For any of the 15 combinations, the quadruple $(a,b,c,d)$ is uniquely determined
For example, suppose we set $a = 0,$ and $b,$ $c,$ $d$ to be positive
Then $b = c = d,$ and $b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4,$ so $b = c = d = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}.$
Hence, there are $\boxed{15}$ possible quadruples $(a,b,c,d).$
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[[(x + y) + (x + z) + (y + z)] \left( \frac{1}{x + y} + \frac{1}{x + z} + \frac{1}{y + z} \right) \ge (1 + 1 + 1)^2 = 9,\]so
\[\frac{1}{x + y} + \frac{1}{x + z} + \frac{1}{y + z} \ge \frac{9}{2(x + y + z)} = \frac{9}{2}.\]Equality occurs when $x = y = z = \frac{1}{3},$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{\frac{9}{2}}.$
The distance between the origin and $F_1$ is 2, and the distance between the origin and $F_2$ is 3, so every point $P$ on the ellipse satisfies
\[PF_1 + PF_2 = 5.\]So, if $(x,0)$ is an intercept of the ellipse, then
\[\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + \sqrt{(x - 3)^2} = 5.\]We can write this as
\[\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + |x - 3| = 5.\]If $x \le 3,$ then
\[\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + (3 - x) = 5,\]so $\sqrt{x^2 + 4} = x + 2.$  Squaring both sides, we get
\[x^2 + 4 = x^2 + 4x + 4,\]which leads to $x = 0.$  This solution corresponds to the origin.
If $x \ge 3,$ then
\[\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + (x - 3) = 5,\]so $\sqrt{x^2 + 4} = 8 - x.$  Squaring both sides, we get
\[x^2 + 4 = 64 - 16x + x^2,\]which leads to $x = \frac{15}{4}.$  Thus, the other $x$-intercept is $\boxed{\left( \frac{15}{4}, 0 \right)}.$
Let $p = \frac{x}{a},$ $q = \frac{y}{b},$ $r = \frac{z}{c}.$  Then $p + q + r = 3$ and $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{r} = 0,$ so $pq + pr + qr = 0.$
We want $p^2 + q^2 + r^2.$  Squaring the equation $p + q + r = 3,$ we get
\[p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2(pq + pr + qr) = 9,\]so $p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = \boxed{9}.$
We have that
\[\frac{x^2 - 19}{x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6} = \frac{A}{x - 1} + \frac{B}{x + 2} + \frac{C}{x - 3}.\]Multiplying both sides by $x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 1)(x + 2)(x - 3),$ we get
\[x^2 - 19 = A(x + 2)(x - 3) + B(x - 1)(x - 3) + C(x - 1)(x + 2).\]Setting $x = 1,$ we get $-6A = -18$, so $A = 3.$
Setting $x = -2,$ we get $15B = -15,$ so $B = -1.$
Setting $x = 3,$ we get $10C = -10,$ so $C = -1.$  Hence, $ABC = \boxed{3}.$
Because the polynomial has rational coefficients, the radical conjugate of each of the four roots must also be roots of the polynomial
Therefore, the polynomial has at least $4 \times 2 = 8$ roots, so its degree is at least 8.
Note that for each of the four numbers, the monic quadratic with that number and its conjugate has rational coefficients
For example, the quadratic with roots $2 - \sqrt{5}$ and $2 + \sqrt{5}$ is
\[(x - 2 + \sqrt{5})(x - 2 - \sqrt{5}) = (x - 2)^2 - 5 = x^2 - 4x - 1.\]Thus, there exists such a polynomial of degree $\boxed{8},$ so this is the minimum.
First, we can factor out $xy,$ to get
\[xy (x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 + y + y^2 + y^3) = xy(x^3 + y^3 + x^2 + y^2 + x + y + 1).\]We know $x + y = 3.$  Let $p = xy.$  Then
\[9 = (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2,\]so $x^2 + y^2 = 9 - 2p.$
\[27 = (x + y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3xy^2 + y^3,\]so $x^3 + y^3 = 27 - 3xy(x + y) = 27 - 9p.$
\begin{align*}
xy (x^3 + y^3 + x^2 + y^2 + x + y + 1) &= p (27 - 9p + 9 - 2p + 3 + 1) \\
&= p(40 - 11p) \\
&= -11p^2 + 40p \\
&= -11 \left( p - \frac{20}{11} \right)^2 + \frac{400}{11} \\
&\le \frac{400}{11}.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $xy = p = \frac{20}{11}.$  By Vieta's formulas, $x$ and $y$ are the roots of
\[t^2 - 3t + \frac{20}{11} = 0.\]The discriminant of this quadratic is positive, so equality is possible
Thus, the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{400}{11}}.$
\[x = \log_2 (27 + \log_2 (27 + \log_2 (27 + \dotsb))).\]Then
\[x = \log_2 (27 + x),\]so $2^x = x + 27.$
To solve this equation, we plot $y = 2^x$ and $y = x + 27.$
unitsize(0.15 cm);
real func (real x) {
return(2^x);
draw(graph(func,-30,log(40)/log(2)),red);
draw((-30,-3)--(13,40),blue);
draw((-30,0)--(13,0));
draw((0,-5)--(0,40));
dot("$(5,32)$", (5,32), SE);
label("$y = 2^x$", (10,16));
label("$y = x + 27$", (-18,18));
[/asy]
By inspection, the graphs intersect at $(5,32).$  Beyond this point, the graph of $y = 2^x$ increases much faster than the graph of $y = x + 27,$ so the only positive solution is $x = \boxed{5}.$
Setting $x = \pi,$ we get
\[(-1)^n \ge \frac{1}{n},\]so $n$ must be even
Let $n = 2m.$
Setting $x = \frac{\pi}{4},$ we get
\[\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^{2m} + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^{2m} \ge \frac{1}{2m}.\]This simplifies to
\[\frac{1}{2^{m - 1}} \ge \frac{1}{2m},\]so $2^{m - 2} \le m.$  We see that $m = 4$ is a solution, and the function $2^{m - 2}$ grows faster than $m,$ so $m = 4$ is the largest possible value of $m.$
We must then prove that
\[\sin^8 x + \cos^8 x \ge \frac{1}{8}\]for all real numbers $x.$
By QM-AM,
\[\sqrt{\frac{\sin^8 x + \cos^8 x}{2}} \ge \frac{\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x}{2},\]so
\[\sin^8 x + \cos^8 x \ge \frac{(\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x)^2}{2}.\]Again by QM-AM,
\[\sqrt{\frac{\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x}{2}} \ge \frac{\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x}{2} = \frac{1}{2},\]so
\[\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x \ge \frac{1}{2}.\]Therefore,
\[\sin^8 x + \cos^8 x \ge \frac{(1/2)^2}{2} = \frac{1}{8}.\]We conclude that the largest such positive integer $n$ is $\boxed{8}.$
Suppose $a < 0,$ $b < 0,$ and $a < b.$  Then
\[\frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{b} = \frac{b - a}{ab} > 0,\]so $\frac{1}{a} > \frac{1}{b}.$  Thus, not all five statements can be true.
If we take $a = -2$ and $b = -1,$ then all the statements are true except the first statement
Hence, the maximum number of statements that can be true is $\boxed{4}.$
Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we add 1 to both sides to get $xy + x + y + 1 = 81,$ so
\[(x + 1)(y + 1) = 81.\]The only possibility is then $x + 1 = 27$ and $y + 1 = 3,$ so $x = \boxed{26}.$
We can write $z^2 - z - (5 - 5i) = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,
\[z = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4(5 - 5i)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{21 - 20i}}{2}.\]Let $21 - 20i = (a + bi)^2,$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers
This expands as
\[a^2 + 2abi - b^2 = 21 - 20i.\]Equating the real and imaginary parts, we get $a^2 - b^2 = 21$ and $ab = -10,$ so $b = -\frac{10}{a}.$  Substituting, we get
\[a^2 - \frac{100}{a^2} = 21.\]Then $a^4 - 21a^2 - 100 = 0,$ which factors as $(a^2 - 25)(a^2 + 4) = 0.$  Since $a$ is real, $a^2 = 25,$ which means $a = 5$ or $a = -5.$
If $a = 5,$ then $b = -2,$ so
\[z = \frac{1 + 5 - 2i}{2} = 3 - i.\]If $a = -5,$ then $b = 2,$ so
\[z = \frac{1 - 5 + 2i}{2} = -2 + i.\]Therefore, the solutions are $\boxed{3 - i, -2 + i}.$
We have that
$$\begin{aligned} f(g(x)) &= f\left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right) = 6\left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right) - 9 \\
&= 2x + 12 - 9\\
&= 2x + 3
\end{aligned}$$and
$$\begin{aligned} g(f(x)) &= g(6x-9) = \frac{6x-9}{3} + 2 \\
&= 2x -3 +2\\
&= 2x -1.
\end{aligned}$$So
$$f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = 2x+3 - (2x-1) = 2x + 3 - 2x +1 = \boxed{4}.$$
This doesn't look like any of the standard forms of any of the conic sections
Instead, we appeal to the definitions of the conic sections
Note that the two terms on the left-hand side represent the distances in the $xy-$plane from $(x, y)$ to $(0, 1)$ and $(5, -3),$ respectively
So the given equation really says that the sum of the distances from $(x, y)$ to $(0, 1)$ and $(5, -3)$ is a constant (namely, $10$)
So the graph of this equation should be an ellipse.
To check that the ellipse is non-degenerate, we compute the distance between $(0,1)$ and $(5,-3)$ to be \[\sqrt{(5-0)^2 + (-3-1)^2} = \sqrt{41},\]which is less than $10.$ Therefore, the given equation satisfies the triangle inequality, so the ellipse is non-degenerate
The answer is $\boxed{\text{(E)}}.$
From the Factor theorem, if $x-t$ is a factor of $ 6x^2+13x-5$ we know that
$$6t^2+13t - 5 = 0$$Factoring gives us
$$(2t+5)(3t-1) = 0$$Hence $t = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$ or $t = \boxed{-\frac{5}{2}}$.
Let $r$ be a root of $x^2-x-1$
Then, rearranging, we have
$$r^2 = r+1.$$Multiplying both sides by $r$ and substituting gives
\begin{align*}
r^3 &= r^2+r \\
&= (r+1)+r \\
&= 2r+1.
\end{align*}Repeating this process twice more, we have
\begin{align*}
r^4 &= r(2r+1) \\
&= 2r^2+r \\
&= 2(r+1)+r \\
&= 3r+2
\end{align*}and
\begin{align*}
r^5 &= r(3r+2) \\
&= 3r^2+2r \\
&= 3(r+1)+2r \\
&= 5r+3.
\end{align*}Thus, each root of $x^2-x-1$ is also a root of $x^5-5x-3$, which gives $bc = 5\cdot 3 = \boxed{15}$.
(It is left to the reader to investigate why this answer is unique.)
When we shift the graph of $y = 2x^2 - x + 7$ four units to the right, we obtain the graph of $y = 2(x - 4)^2 - (x - 4) + 7$, which simplifies to $y = 2x^2 - 17x + 43$
Therefore, $a + b + c = 2 - 17 + 43 = \boxed{28}$.
Another way to solve the problem is as follows: The graph of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ always passes through the point $(1, a + b + c)$
In other words, $a + b + c$ is the $y$-coordinate of the point on the parabola whose $x$-coordinate is 1
But this parabola is obtained by shifting the graph of $y = 2x^2 - x + 7$ four units to the right, so $a + b + c$ is also the $y$-coordinate of the point on the original parabola whose $x$-coordinate is $1 - 4 = -3$
This $y$-coordinate is equal to $2 \cdot (-3)^2 - (-3) + 7 = 28$.
The quadratic equation in $x$ is $kx^2 - (k - 1) x + 5 = 0,$ so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b = \frac{k - 1}{k}$ and $ab = \frac{5}{k}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} &= \frac{a^2 + b^2}{ab} \\
&= \frac{(a + b)^2 - 2ab}{ab} \\
&= \frac{(a + b)^2}{ab} - 2 \\
&= \frac{(\frac{k - 1}{k})^2}{\frac{5}{k}} - 2 \\
&= \frac{(k - 1)^2}{5k} - 2.
\end{align*}So
\[\frac{(k - 1)^2}{5k} - 2 = \frac{4}{5}.\]This equation simplifies to $k^2 - 16k + 1 = 0.$  Again by Vieta's formulas, $k_1 + k_2 = 16$ and $k_1 k_2 = 1,$ so
\begin{align*}
\frac{k_1}{k_2} + \frac{k_2}{k_1} &= \frac{k_1^2 + k_2^2}{k_1 k_2} \\
&= \frac{(k_1 + k_2)^2 - 2k_1 k_2}{k_1 k_2} \\
&= \frac{(k_1 + k_2)^2}{k_1 k_2} - 2 \\
&= 16^2 - 2 = \boxed{254}.
\end{align*}
Taking $d = 3,$ we get
\[f(4) - f(3) = 3.\]Taking $d = 4,$ we get
\[f(5) - f(4) = 3.\]Adding these equations, we get $f(5) - f(3) = 6,$ so $f(3) - f(5) = \boxed{-6}.$
Let $\alpha = a + bi$ and $\gamma = c + di,$ where $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ are real numbers
\begin{align*}
f(1) &= (4 + i) + \alpha + \gamma = (a + c + 4) + (b + d + 1)i, \\
f(i) &= (4 + i)(-1) + \alpha i + \gamma = (-b + c - 4) + (a + d - 1)i.
\end{align*}Since $f(1)$ and $f(i)$ are both real, $b + d + 1 = 0$ and $a + d - 1 = 0,$ so $a = -d + 1$ and $b = -d - 1.$  Then
\begin{align*}
|\alpha| + |\gamma| &= \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} + \sqrt{c^2 + d^2} \\
&= \sqrt{(-d + 1)^2 + (-d - 1)^2} + \sqrt{c^2 + d^2} \\
&= \sqrt{2d^2 + 2} + \sqrt{c^2 + d^2} \\
&\ge \sqrt{2}.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $a = 1,$ $b = -1,$ $c = 0,$ and $d = 0.$  Therefore, the minimum value is $\boxed{\sqrt{2}}.$
From the formula for a geometric series,
\[704 + \frac{704}{2} + \frac{704}{4} + \dots + \frac{704}{2^{n - 1}} = 704 \cdot \frac{1 - \frac{1}{2^n}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 1408 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^n} \right),\]and
\[1984 - \frac{1984}{2} + \frac{1984}{4} + \dots + \frac{1984}{(-2)^{n - 1}} = 1984 \cdot \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(-2)^n}}{1 + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{3968}{3} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(-2)^n} \right).\]Hence,
\[1408 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^n} \right) = \frac{3968}{3} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(-2)^n} \right).\]This reduces to
\[33 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^n} \right) = 31 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(-2)^n} \right).\]If $n$ is even, then $(-2)^n = 2^n,$ and there are no solutions
Otherwise, $n$ is odd, and $(-2)^n = -2^n,$ so
\[33 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^n} \right) = 31 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^n} \right).\]Isolating $2^n,$ we get $2^n = 32,$ so $n = \boxed{5}.$
The denominator factors as $x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2,$ so the vertical asymptote is $x = 2.$
\[y = \frac{x^2 - 4x + 3}{x^2 - 4x + 4} = \frac{(x^2 - 4x + 4) - 1}{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 1 - \frac{1}{x^2 - 4x + 4}.\]Thus, the horizontal asymptote is $y = 1,$ and the intersection of the two asymptote is $\boxed{(2,1)}.$
Since the inequality is always true for $M = 0,$ it suffices to consider the case $M \neq 0.$
For a particular $c$ and for any tuple $(x_1, \dots, x_{101})$ satisfying the conditions, the tuple $(-x_1, \dots, -x_{101})$ satisfies the conditions as well, so we may assume that $M > 0.$ Finally, we may assume that $x_1 \le x_2 \le \dots \le x_{101},$ so that $M = x_{51}.$
We want to find the largest $c$ such that the inequality \[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_{101}^2 \ge cx_{51}^2\]always holds, where $x_1 \le x_2 \le \dots \le x_{101}$ and $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_{101} = 0.$ Therefore, fixing a value of $x_{51},$ we should write inequalities that minimize $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_{101}^2.$
To compare the terms on the left-hand side to $x_{51}^2,$ we deal with the terms $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_{50}^2$ and $x_{51}^2+x_{52}^2+\dots+x_{101}^2$ separately.
By Cauchy-Schwarz, \[(1 + 1 + \dots + 1)(x_1^2+x_2^2+\dots+x_{50}^2) \ge (x_1+x_2+\dots+x_{50})^2,\]so \[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_{50}^2 \ge \tfrac{1}{50}\left(x_1+x_2+\dots+x_{50}\right)^2.\]We have $x_1+x_2+\dots+x_{50} = -x_{51}-x_{52} -\dots - x_{101}\le -51x_{51} $ because $x_{51} \le x_{52} \le \dots \le x_{101}.$ Since $x_{51} > 0,$ both $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_{50}$ and $-51x_{51}$ are negative, so we can write \[\begin{aligned} x_1^2+x_2^2+\dots+x_{50}^2 &\ge \tfrac{1}{50} (x_1+x_2+\dots+x_{50})^2\\ & \ge\tfrac{1}{50} \left(-51x_{51}\right)^2 \\ &= \tfrac{51^2}{50} x_{51}^2
\end{aligned}\]On the other hand, since $0 < x_{51} \le x_{52} \le \dots \le x_{101},$ we simply have \[x_{51}^2 + x_{52}^2 + \dots + x_{101}^2 \ge 51x_{51}^2.\]Putting all this together gives \[(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_{50})^2 + (x_{51}^2 + x_{52}^2 + \dots + x_{101}^2) \ge \left(\tfrac{51^2}{50} + 51\right) x_{51}^2 = \tfrac{5151}{50} x_{51}^2.\]Equality holds when $x_1 = x_2 = \dots = x_{50} = -\tfrac{51}{50}$ and $x_{51} = x_{52} = \dots = x_{101} = 1,$ so the answer is $\boxed{\tfrac{5151}{50}}.$
First we write down the equation $a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} + a_{n+1} + a_n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 27$: \[\begin{aligned} a_4 &= a_3+a_2+a_1, \\ a_5&=a_4+a_3+a_2, \\ a_6&=a_5+a_4+a_3, \\\vdots \\ a_{30}&=a_{29}+a_{28}+a_{27}
\end{aligned}\]Let $S = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_{28}$ (the desired quantity)
Summing all these equations, we see that the left-hand side and right-hand side are equivalent to \[S + a_{29} + a_{30} - a_1 - a_2 - a_3 = (S + a_{29} - a_1-a_2) + (S - a_1) + (S-a_{28}).\]Simplifying and solving for $S$, we obtain \[S = \frac{a_{28} + a_{30}}{2} = \frac{6090307+20603361}{2} = \frac{\dots 3668}{2} = \dots 834.\]Therefore, the remainder when $S$ is divided by $1000$ is $\boxed{834}$.
Setting $y = 0,$ we get
\[f(x^2) = f(x)^2 - 2xf(0).\]Let $c = f(0),$ so $f(x^2) = f(x)^2 - 2cx.$  In particular, for $x = 0,$ $c = c^2,$ so $c = 0$ or $c = 1.$
Setting $x = 0,$ we get
\[f(y^2) = c^2 + y^2.\]In other words, $f(x^2) = x^2 + c^2$ for all $x.$  But $f(x^2) = f(x)^2 - 2cx,$ so
\[f(x)^2 - 2cx = x^2 + c^2.\]Hence,
\[f(x)^2 = x^2 + 2cx + c^2 = (x + c)^2
\quad (*)\]Setting $y = x,$ we get
\[c = f(x)^2 - 2xf(x) + x^2,\]or
\[f(x)^2 = -x^2 + 2xf(x) + c.\]From $(*),$ $f(x)^2 = x^2 + 2cx + c^2,$ so $-x^2 + 2xf(x) + c = x^2 + 2cx + c^2.$  Hence,
\[2xf(x) = 2x^2 + 2cx = 2x (x + c).\]So for $x \neq 0,$
\[f(x) = x + c.\]We can then extend this to say $f(x) = x + c$ for all $x.$
Since $c$ must be 0 or 1, the only possible solutions are $f(x) = x$ and $f(x) = x + 1.$  We can check that both functions work.
Thus, $n = 2$ and $s = 1 + 2 = 3,$ so $n \times s = \boxed{6}.$
We take cases on the sign of $y-1.$ If $y \ge 1,$ then the equation simplifies to \[\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + (y-1) = 3,\]or \[\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = 4-y.\]Squaring both sides, we get $x^2 + y^2 = (4-y)^2 = y^2 -8y + 16,$ or $x^2 = -8y + 16.$ Solving for $y,$ we get \[y = -\frac{1}{8}x^2 + 2,\]so the vertex of this parabola is $(0, 2).$
If $y < 1,$ then we have \[\sqrt{x^2+y^2} + (1-y) = 3,\]or \[\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = y+2.\]Squaring both sides, we get $x^2+y^2 = y^2+4y+4,$ and solving for $y$ gives \[y = \frac14x^2-1.\]So the vertex of this parabola is $(0, -1).$
Thus, the distance between the vertices of the two parabolas is $|2 - (-1)| = \boxed{3}.$ (Note that $3$ is the number that appears on the right-hand side
Is this a coincidence?)
Since the coefficients are real, the other roots must be $-2 + 3i.$  Thus, the quadratic is a constant multiple of
\[(x + 2 + 3i)(x + 2 - 3i) = (x + 2)^2 - (3i)^2 = (x + 2)^2 + 9 = x^2 + 4x + 13.\]We want the coefficient of $x$ to be $-4,$ so we simply multiply this quadratic by $-1,$ to get $\boxed{-x^2 - 4x - 13}.$
The vertical asymptote of $f(x)$ is $x = 2.$  Hence, $d = 2.$
By long division,
\[f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x - 2 - \frac{2}{2x - 4}.\]Thus, the oblique asymptote of $f(x)$ is $y = \frac{1}{2} x - 2,$ which passes through $(0,-2).$  Therefore, the oblique asymptote of $g(x)$ is
\[y = -2x - 2.\]Therefore,
\[g(x) = -2x - 2 + \frac{k}{x - 2}\]for some constant $k.$
Finally,
\[f(-2) = \frac{(-2)^2 - 6(-2) + 6}{2(-6) - 4} = -\frac{11}{4},\]so
\[g(-2) = -2(-2) - 2 + \frac{k}{-2 - 2} = -\frac{11}{4}.\]Solving, we find $k = 19.$  Hence,
\[g(x) = -2x - 2 + \frac{19}{x - 2} = \frac{-2x^2 + 2x + 23}{x - 2}.\]We want to solve
\[\frac{x^2 - 6x + 6}{2x - 4} = \frac{-2x^2 + 2x + 23}{x - 2}.\]Then $x^2 - 6x + 6 = -4x^2 + 4x + 46,$ or $5x^2 - 10x - 40 = 0.$  This factors as $5(x + 2)(x - 4) = 0,$ so the other point of intersection occurs at $x = 4.$  Since
\[f(4) = \frac{4^2 - 6 \cdot 4 + 6}{2(4) - 4} = -\frac{1}{2},\]the other point of intersection is $\boxed{\left( 4, -\frac{1}{2} \right)}.$
The graph of
\[x^2 - xy = \left( x - \frac{y}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{y^2}{4}\]is a parabola with vertex at $\left( \frac{y}{2}, -\frac{y^2}{4} \right).$
We divide into cases, based on the value of $y.$
If $y \le 0,$ then
\[|x^2 - xy| = x^2 - xy\]for $0 \le x \le 1.$  Since $x^2 - xy$ is increasing on this interval, the maximum value occurs at $x = 1,$ which is $1 - y.$
If $0 \le y \le 1,$ then
\[|x^2 - xy| = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
xy - x^2 & \text{for $0 \le x \le y$}, \\
x^2 - xy & \text{for $y \le x \le 1$}.
\end{array}
\right.\]Thus, for $0 \le x \le y,$ the maximum is $\frac{y^2}{4},$ and for $y \le x \le 1,$ the maximum is $1 - y.$
If $y \ge 1,$ then
\[|x^2 - xy| = xy - x^2\]for $0 \le x \le 1.$ If $1 \le y \le 2,$ then the maximum value is $\frac{y^2}{4},$ and if $y \ge 2,$ then the maximum value is $y - 1.$
For $y \le 0,$ the maximum value is $1 - y,$ which is at least 1
For $1 \le y \le 2,$ the maximum value is $\frac{y^2}{4},$ which is at least $\frac{1}{4}.$  For $y \ge 2,$ the maximum value is $y - 1,$ which is at least 1.
For $0 \le y \le 1,$ we want to compare $\frac{y^2}{4}$ and $1 - y.$  The inequality
\[\frac{y^2}{4} \ge 1 - y\]reduces to $y^2 + 4y - 4 \ge 0.$  The solutions to $y^2 + 4y - 4 = 0$ are $-2 \pm 2 \sqrt{2}.$  Hence if $0 \le y \le -2 + 2 \sqrt{2},$ then the maximum is $1 - y,$ and if $-2 + 2 \sqrt{2} \le y \le 1,$ then the maximum is $\frac{y^2}{4}.$  Note that $1 - y$ is decreasing for $0 \le y \le -2 + 2 \sqrt{2},$ and $\frac{y^2}{4}$ is increasing for $-2 + 2 \sqrt{2} \le y \le 1,$ so the minimum value of the maximum value occurs at $y = -2 + 2 \sqrt{2},$ which is
\[1 - (-2 + 2 \sqrt{2}) = 3 - 2 \sqrt{2}.\]Since this is less than $\frac{1}{4},$ the overall minimum value is $\boxed{3 - 2 \sqrt{2}}.$
Hoping for cancellation, we first compute $\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{d},$ since $a$ and $d$ have two opposite signs: \[\begin{aligned} \frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{d}&=\frac{a+d}{ad} \\ &= \frac{(\sqrt2+\sqrt3+\sqrt6) + (-\sqrt2-\sqrt3+\sqrt6)}{(\sqrt2+\sqrt3+\sqrt6)(-\sqrt2-\sqrt3+\sqrt6)} \\ &= \frac{2\sqrt6}{(\sqrt6)^2-(\sqrt2+\sqrt3)^2} \\ &= \frac{2\sqrt6}{1 - 2\sqrt6}.\end{aligned}\]Similar cancellation occurs when adding $\frac1b+\frac1c$: \[\begin{aligned} \frac1b+\frac1c &= \frac{b+c}{bc} \\ &= \frac{(-\sqrt2+\sqrt3+\sqrt6) + (\sqrt2-\sqrt3+\sqrt6)}{(-\sqrt2+\sqrt3+\sqrt6)(\sqrt2-\sqrt3+\sqrt6)} \\ &= \frac{2\sqrt6}{(\sqrt6)^2-(\sqrt2-\sqrt3)^2} \\ &= \frac{2\sqrt6}{1+2\sqrt6}
\end{aligned}\]It follows that \[\begin{aligned} \frac1a+\frac1b+\frac1c+\frac1d &= \frac{2\sqrt6}{1-2\sqrt6} + \frac{2\sqrt6}{1+2\sqrt6} \\ &= \frac{4\sqrt6}{1^2 - (2\sqrt6)^2}\\& = -\frac{4\sqrt6}{23}, \end{aligned}\]so $\left(\frac1a+\frac1b+\frac1c+\frac1d\right)^2 = \boxed{\frac{96}{529}}.$
We consider cases
Either the exponent is $0$, or the base must be either $1$ or $-1$
(These are the only ways that $a^b=1$ is possible if $a$ and $b$ are real numbers
Also, if the base is $-1$, then the exponent must be an even integer.)
Note: The first two cases use Vieta's Formula for the sum of the roots of a quadratic
A short derivation follows in case you are not familiar with them.
Vieta's Formulas
If $p$ and $q$ are roots of the quadratic $x^2 + bx + c$ then $(x-p)(x-q)=0$
But $(x-p)(x-q) = x^2 - (p+q)x +(pq)$
Therefore, the sum of roots, $p+q$, equals $-b$ and the product of roots, $pq$, equals $c$.
If you have a quadratic where the leading coefficient is not $1$ (and not $0$), then it can be written in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$
Since to find the roots we set it equal to $0$, we can divide the entire thing by $a$ to get $x^2 + \frac ba x + \frac ca = 0$
Similar to the case where the leading coefficient is $1$, the sum of roots, $p+q$ will now be $- \frac ba$ and the product of roots, $pq$, will now be $\frac ca$.
First case: The exponent is $0$ when $0=x^2-5x+2$
Note that the discriminant of this quadratic equation is $5^2-4(1)(2)=17$, which is positive; thus there are two distinct real roots
By Vieta's formulas, they add up to $5$
Furthermore, note that neither of these roots is also a root of $x^2-4x+2=0$, so we don't have to worry about getting $0^0$ in our original equation
Thus we have our first two solutions, and they add up to $5$.
Second case: The base is $1$ when $0=x^2-4x+1$
Again, this equation has a positive discriminant and thus two real roots
By Vieta's formulas, these roots add up to $4$
Both are automatically solutions to our original equation, since $1^b=1$ for all real $b$.
Third case: The base is $-1$ when $0=x^2-4x+3=(x-1)(x-3)$ (finally, a quadratic we can factor nicely!)
This gives us potential solutions of $x=1$ and $x=3$, but we'd better check them! As it turns out $x=1$ gives $(-1)^{-2}=1$ and $x=3$ gives $(-1)^{-4}=1$, so both are solutions to our original equation.
Thus we have six solutions in all
The first two added up to $5$, the next two added up to $4$, and the last two added up to $4$, so the sum of the six solutions is $\boxed{13}$.
Since $-2$ and 3 are roots,
\begin{align*}
a(-2)^3 + (a + 2b) (-2)^2 + (b - 3a)(-2) + (8 - a) &= 0, \\
a(3)^3 + (a + 2b) 3^2 + (b - 3a)(3) + (8 - a) &= 0.
\end{align*}Solving, we find $a = \frac{8}{9}$ and $b = -\frac{40}{27}.$  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is
\[-\frac{a + 2b}{a} = \frac{7}{3},\]so the third root is $\frac{7}{3} - (-2) - 3 = \boxed{\frac{4}{3}}.$
Let $y = \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{3})^x}.$  Then
\[\sqrt{(2 - \sqrt{3})^x} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{3}} \right)^x } = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{3})^x}} = \frac{1}{y},\]so the given equation becomes $y + \frac{1}{y} = 4.$  Then $y^2 + 1 = 4y,$ or
\[y^2 - 4y + 1 = 0.\]By the quadratic formula,
\[y = 2 \pm \sqrt{3}.\]Thus,
\[\sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{3})^x} = 2 \pm \sqrt{3}.\]For the $+$ root,
\[\sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{3})^x} = 2 + \sqrt{3},\]so $x = 2.$  For the $-$ root,
\[\sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{3})^x} = 2 - \sqrt{3} = \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{3}} = (2 + \sqrt{3})^{-1},\]so $x = -2.$   Thus, the solutions are $\boxed{2,-2}.$
The center of the hyperbola is $(h,k) = (-2,0).$  The distance between the center and one vertex is $a = 3,$ and the distance between the center and one focus is $c = \sqrt{34}.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 34 - 3^2 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$
Therefore, $h + k + a + b = -2 + 0 + 3 + 5 = \boxed{6}.$
Let $y = \sqrt{x - 1}.$  Then $y^2 = x - 1,$ so $x = y^2 + 1.$  Then
\[\frac{x + 8}{\sqrt{x - 1}} = \frac{y^2 + 9}{y} = y + \frac{9}{y}.\]By AM-GM,
\[y + \frac{9}{y} \ge 6.\]Equality occurs when $y = 3,$ or $x = 10,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{6}.$
The sum of the nine entries is
\[ad + bd + cd + ae + be + ce + af + bf + cf = (a + b + c)(d + e + f).\]Note that the sum $(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 41$ is fixed, so to maximize $(a + b + c)(d + e + f),$ we want the two factors to be as close as possible, i.e
$20 \times 21 = 420.$
We can achieve this by taking $\{a,b,c\} = \{2,5,13\}$ and $\{d,e,f\} = \{3,7,11\},$ so the maximum sum is $\boxed{420}.$
We claim that $F(n) = 2^n - \frac{1}{2^n}$ for all nonnegative integers $n.$  We prove this by strong induction.
The result for $n = 0$ and $n = 1.$  Assume that the result holds for $n = 0,$ 1, 2, $\dots,$ $k,$ for some nonnegative integer $k \ge 1,$ so $F(k - 1) = 2^{k - 1} - \frac{1}{2^{k - 1}}$ and $F(k) = 2^k - \frac{1}{2^k}.$
\begin{align*}
F(k + 1) &= \frac{5}{2} F(k) - F(k - 1) \\
&= \frac{5}{2} \left( 2^k - \frac{1}{2^k} \right) - \left( 2^{k - 1} - \frac{1}{2^{k - 1}} \right) \\
&= \frac{5}{2} \cdot 2^k - \frac{5}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2^k} - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^k + \frac{2}{2^k} \\
&= 2 \cdot 2^k - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2^k} \\
&= 2^{k + 1} - \frac{1}{2^{k + 1}}.
\end{align*}Thus, the result holds for $n = k + 1,$ so by induction, the result holds for all $n \ge 0.$
Then the sum we seek is
\[\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{F(2^n)} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^{2^n} - \frac{1}{2^{2^n}}} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{2^{2^n}}{(2^{2^n})^2 - 1}.\]Let $x = 2^{2^n}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
\frac{2^{2^n}}{(2^{2^n})^2 - 1} &= \frac{x}{x^2 - 1} \\
&= \frac{(x + 1) - 1}{x^2 - 1} \\
&= \frac{x + 1}{x^2 - 1} - \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} \\
&= \frac{1}{x - 1} - \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} \\
&= \frac{1}{2^{2^n} - 1} - \frac{1}{2^{2^{n +1}} - 1}.
\end{align*}Thus, our sum telescopes:
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{2^{2^n}}{(2^{2^n})^2 - 1} &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2^{2^n} - 1} - \frac{1}{2^{2^{n +1}} - 1} \right) \\
&= \left( \frac{1}{2^{2^0} - 1} - \frac{1}{2^{2^1} - 1} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{2^{2^1} - 1} - \frac{1}{2^{2^2} - 1} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{2^{2^2} - 1} - \frac{1}{2^{2^3} - 1} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
By the Binomial Theorem,
\begin{align*}
(1 + i)^{99} &= \binom{99}{0} + \binom{99}{1} i + \binom{99}{2} i^2 + \binom{99}{3} i^3 + \dots + \binom{99}{98} i^{98} + \binom{99}{99} i^{99} \\
&= \binom{99}{0} + \binom{99}{1} i - \binom{99}{2} - \binom{99}{3} i + \dots - \binom{99}{98} - \binom{99}{99} i.
\end{align*}Thus, the sum we seek is the real part of $(1 + i)^{99}.$
Note that $(1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 2i,$ so
\begin{align*}
(1 + i)^{99} &= (1 + i)^{98} \cdot (1 + i) \\
&= (2i)^{49} (1 + i) \\
&= 2^{49} \cdot i^{49} \cdot (1 + i) \\
&= 2^{49} \cdot i \cdot (1 + i) \\
&= 2^{49} (-1 + i) \\
&= -2^{49} + 2^{49} i.
\end{align*}Hence, the given sum is $\boxed{-2^{49}}.$
The equation simplifies to $3x^3+9x^2+15x+9=x^3+9x^2+27x+27$, or equivalently, $2x^3-12x-18=2(x-3)(x^2+3x+3)=0$
The discriminant of $x^2+3x+3$ is $-3<0$, so the only real solution is $x=\boxed{3}$.
We can write
\begin{align*}
A^2 - B^2 &= (A + B)(A - B) \\
&= (\sqrt{x + 2} + \sqrt{x + 1} + \sqrt{y + 5} + \sqrt{y + 1} + \sqrt{z + 10} + \sqrt{z + 1}) \\
&\quad \times (\sqrt{x + 2} - \sqrt{x + 1} + \sqrt{y + 5} - \sqrt{y + 1} + \sqrt{z + 10} - \sqrt{z + 1}).
\end{align*}Let
\begin{align*}
a_1 &= \sqrt{x + 2} + \sqrt{x + 1}, \\
b_1 &= \sqrt{y + 5} + \sqrt{y + 1}, \\
c_1 &= \sqrt{z + 10} + \sqrt{z + 1}, \\
a_2 &= \sqrt{x + 2} - \sqrt{x + 1}, \\
b_2 &= \sqrt{y + 5} - \sqrt{y + 1}, \\
c_2 &= \sqrt{z + 10} - \sqrt{z + 1}.
\end{align*}Then by Cauchy-Schwarz,
\begin{align*}
A^2 - B^2 &= (a_1 + b_1 + c_1)(a_2 + b_2 + c_2) \\
&\ge (\sqrt{a_1 a_2} + \sqrt{b_1 b_2} + \sqrt{c_2 c_2})^2 \\
&= (1 + 2 + 3)^2 \\
&= 36.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when
\[\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{b_1}{b_2} = \frac{c_1}{c_2},\]or equivalently,
\[\frac{x + 2}{x + 1} = \frac{y + 5}{y + 1} = \frac{z + 10}{z + 1}.\]For example, if we set each fraction to 2, then we get $x = 0,$ $y = 3,$ and $z = 8.$
Hence, the minimum value is $\boxed{36}.$
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\[((x + 2) + 2(y + 2)) \left( \frac{1}{x + 2} + \frac{1}{y + 2} \right) \ge (1 + \sqrt{2})^2.\]Then
\[x + 2 + 2y + 4 \ge 3 (1 + \sqrt{2})^2 = 9 + 6 \sqrt{2},\]so $x + 2y \ge 3 + 6 \sqrt{2}.$
Equality occurs when $(x + 2)^2 = 2(y + 2)^2,$ or $x + 2 = (y + 2) \sqrt{2}.$  Substituting into $\frac{1}{x + 2} + \frac{1}{y + 2} = \frac{1}{3},$ we get
\[\frac{1}{(y + 2) \sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{y + 2} = \frac{1}{3}.\]Solving, we find $y = \frac{2 + 3 \sqrt{2}}{2}.$  Then $x = 1 + 3 \sqrt{2}.$
Hence, the minimum value we seek is $\boxed{3 + 6 \sqrt{2}}.$
By the Rational Root Theorem, any root of the polynomial must divide $9$
Therefore the roots are among the numbers $\pm 1,3$
Since these are only four values, we can try all of them to find that $x=3$ and $x=-1$ are roots and $x=-3$ and $x=1$ are not.
Since the given polynomial is cubic, it must have three roots
This means that one of $3$ or $-1$ is a root twice (i.e
has multiplicity $2$)
The Factor Theorem tells us that since $-1$ and $3$ are roots of the polynomial, $x+1$ and $x-3$ must be factors of the polynomial
To find which root occurs twice, we can divide $x^3-5x^2+3x+9$ by $x+1$ to get  $x^3-5x^2+3x+9 = (x+1)(x^2-6x+9)$.
We can factorise $x^2-6x+9$ as $(x-3)^2$ which means that the root $x=3$ has multiplicity 2
Thus our roots are $\boxed{-1,3,3}$.
If all the $a_i$ are equal to 0, then the polynomial becomes $x^9 = 0,$ which has only one integer root, namely $x = 0.$  Thus, we can assume that there is some coefficient $a_i$ that is non-zero
Let $k$ be the smallest integer such that $a_k \neq 0$; then we can take out a factor of $x^k,$ to get
\[x^k (x^{9 - k} + a_8 x^{8 - k} + a_7 x^{7 - k} + \dots + a_{k + 1} x + a_k) = 0.\]By the Integer Root Theorem, any integer root of $x^{9 - k} + a_8 x^{8 - k} + \dots + a_{k + 1} x + a_k = 0$ must divide $a_k = 1,$ so the only possible integer roots are 1 and $-1.$ However, if we plug in $x = 1,$ we see that $x^{9 - k} = 1,$ and all the other terms are nonnegative, so $x = 1$ cannot be a root.
Therefore, for the original polynomial to have two different integer roots, they must be 0 and $-1.$  For 0 to be a root, it suffices to take $a_0 = 0,$ and the polynomial is
\[x^9 + a_8 x^8 + a_7 x^7 + a_6 x^6 + a_5 x^5 + a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x = 0.\]We also want $x = -1$ to be a root
We have that $(-1)^9 = -1,$ so in order for the polynomial to become 0 at $x = -1,$ we must choose some of the $a_i$ to be equal to 1
Specifically, if $k$ is the number of $i$ such that $a_i = 1$ and $i$ is odd, then the number of $i$ such that $a_i = 1$ and $i$ is even must be $k + 1.$
There are four indices that are odd (1, 3, 5, 7), and four indices that are even (2, 4, 6, 8), so the possible values of $k$ are 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Furthermore, for each $k,$ so the number of ways to choose $k$ odd indices and $k + 1$ even indices is $\binom{4}{k} \binom{4}{k + 1}.$  Therefore, the number of such polynomials is
\[\binom{4}{0} \binom{4}{1} + \binom{4}{1} \binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{2} \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \binom{4}{4} = \boxed{56}.\]
We can write
\[c_k = k + \cfrac{1}{2k + \cfrac{1}{2k + \cfrac{1}{2k + \dotsb}}} = k + \cfrac{1}{k + k + \cfrac{1}{2k + \cfrac{1}{2k + \dotsb}}} = k + \frac{1}{k + c_k}.\]Then $c_k - k = \frac{1}{c_k + k},$ so $c_k^2 - k^2 = 1.$  Hence, $c_k^2 = k^2 + 1.$
Therefore,
\[\sum_{k = 1}^{11} c_k^2 = \sum_{k = 1}^{11} (k^2 + 1).\]In general,
\[\sum_{k = 1}^n k^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6},\]so
\[\sum_{k = 1}^{11} (k^2 + 1) = \frac{11 \cdot 12 \cdot 23}{6} + 11 = \boxed{517}.\]
We have that
\[(-1 + i \sqrt{3})^2 = (-1 + i \sqrt{3})(-1 + i \sqrt{3}) = 1 - 2i \sqrt{3} - 3 = -2 - 2i \sqrt{3},\]and
\[(-1 + i \sqrt{3})^3 = (-1 + i \sqrt{3})(-2 - 2i \sqrt{3}) = 2 + 2i \sqrt{3} - 2i \sqrt{3} + 6 = 8,\]so $(-1 + i \sqrt{3})^6 = 64.$  Then
\[\left( \frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{64}{2^6} = 1.\]Similarly,
\[\left( \frac{-1 - i \sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{64}{2^6} = 1,\]so the expression is equal to $\boxed{2}.$
Expanding, we get
\begin{align*}
(x + i)((x + 1) + i)((x + 2) + i) &= (x^2 + x + xi + (x + 1)i + i^2)((x + 2) + i) \\
&= (x^2 + x - 1 + (2x + 1)i)((x + 2) + i) \\
&= (x^2 + x - 1)(x + 2) + (x^2 + x - 1)i + (2x + 1)(x + 2)i + (2x + 1)i^2 \\
&= (x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 3) + (3x^2 + 6x + 1)i
\end{align*}We want this complex number to be pure imaginary, so the real part $x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 3$ must be 0
This factors as
\[(x + 3)(x + 1)(x - 1) = 0,\]so the solutions are $\boxed{-3,-1,1}.$
It's certainly possible to just calculate the complex number $\omega^2+6\omega+58$ by just plugging in the value of $\omega$, but it's computationally simpler to use the fact that $|ab|=|a|\cdot|b|$ and our knowledge of factoring quadratics: \begin{align*}
|\omega^2+6\omega+58|&=|(\omega+3+7i)(\omega+3-7i)|\\
&=|\omega+3+7i|\cdot|\omega+3-7i|\\
&=|12+9i|\cdot|12-5i|\\
&=\sqrt{12^2+9^2}\sqrt{12^2+(-5)^2}\\
&=15\cdot13\\
&=\boxed{195}
\end{align*}Note that we can get the factorization of the quadratic by either completing the square or (if you've learned it) applying the quadratic equation
Furthermore, knowledge of Pythagorean triples helps speed computations.
Let $y = x^2 + x + 3.$  Then we can write the given equation as
\[\frac{4x}{y} + \frac{5x}{y - 6x} + \frac{3}{2} = 0.\]Multiplying everything by $2y(y - 6x),$ we get
\[8x(y - 6x) + 10xy + 3y(y - 6x) = 0.\]Expanding, we get $3y^2 - 48x^2 = 0,$ so $y^2 - 16x^2 = (y - 4x)(y + 4x) = 0.$  Thus, $y = 4x$ or $y = -4x.$
If $y = 4x,$ then $x^2 + x + 3 = 4x,$ so $x^2 - 3x + 3 = 0.$  This quadratic has no real solutions.
If $y = -4x,$ then $x^2 + x + 3 = -4x,$ so $x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0.$  This quadratic has two real solutions, giving us a total of $\boxed{2}$ real solutions.
Recall that a parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus $F$ and the directrix
To make the algebra a bit easier, we can find the directrix of the parabola $y = 8x^2,$ and then shift it upward 2 units to find the directrix of the parabola $y = 8x^2 + 2.$
Since the parabola $y = 8x^2$ is symmetric about the $y$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(0,f).$  Let $y = d$ be the equation of the directrix.
unitsize(1.5 cm);

Let $(x,8x^2)$ be a point on the parabola $y = 8x^2.$  Then
\[PF^2 = x^2 + (8x^2 - f)^2\]and $PQ^2 = (8x^2 - d)^2.$  Thus,
\[x^2 + (8x^2 - f)^2 = (8x^2 - d)^2.\]Expanding, we get
\[x^2 + 64x^4 - 16fx^2 + f^2 = 64x^4 - 16dx^2 + d^2.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
1 - 16f &= -16d, \\
f^2 &= d^2.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $f - d = \frac{1}{16}.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $-2d = \frac{1}{16},$ so $d = -\frac{1}{32}.$
Thus, the equation of the directrix of $y = 8x^2$ is $y = -\frac{1}{32},$ so the equation of the directrix of $y = 8x^2 + 2$ is $\boxed{y = \frac{63}{32}}.$
From the given information, the center of the ellipse is $(-1,4),$ and the semi-major axis is 10
Thus, the equation of the ellipse is of the form
\[\frac{(x + 1)^2}{10^2} + \frac{(y - 4)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Setting $x = 7$ and $y = 7,$ we get
\[\frac{8^2}{10^2} + \frac{3^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Solving, we find $b^2 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$  Therefore, the area of the ellipse is $\pi \cdot 10 \cdot 5 = \boxed{50 \pi}.$
To find $f^{-1}(7),$ we try solving $f(x) = 7$ on each piece.
If $x + 3 = 7$, then $x = 4,$ which satisfies $x < 20.$  If $2x - 2 = 7,$ then $x = \frac{9}{2},$ which does not satisfy $x \ge 20,$ so $f^{-1}(7) = 4.$
Similarly, $x + 3 = 46,$ then $x = 43,$ which does not satisfy $x < 20.$  If $2x - 2= 46,$ then $x = 24,$ which satisfies $x \ge 20,$ so $f^{-1}(46) = 24.$
Hence, $f^{-1}(7) + f^{-1}(46) = 4 + 24 = \boxed{28}.$
If $x = 0,$ then the expression is equal to 0, so assume that $x \neq 0.$  Then dividing the numerator and denominator by $x^4,$ we get
\[\frac{1}{x^4 + 2x^2 - 4 + \frac{8}{x^2} + \frac{16}{x^4}}.\]By AM-GM,
\[x^4 + \frac{16}{x^4} \ge 2 \sqrt{x^4 \cdot \frac{16}{x^4}} = 8,\]and
\[2x^2 + \frac{8}{x^2} \ge 2 \sqrt{2x^2 \cdot \frac{8}{x^2}} = 8,\]so
\[\frac{1}{x^4 + 2x^2 - 4 + \frac{8}{x^2} + \frac{16}{x^4}} \le \frac{1}{8 + 8 - 4} = \frac{1}{12}.\]Equality occurs when $x = \sqrt{2},$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{1}{12}}.$
First, note that $P$ lies on the line $y - x \sqrt{3} + 3 = 0.$
Solving for $x$ in $2y^2 = 2x + 3,$ we get $x = y^2 - \frac{3}{2}.$  Accordingly, let $A = \left( a^2 - \frac{3}{2}, a \right)$ and $B = \left( b^2 - \frac{3}{2}, b \right).$  We can assume that $a < 0$ and $b > 0.$
unitsize(1 cm);
pair A, B, P;
real upperparab(real x) {
return(sqrt(x + 3/2));
real lowerparab(real x) {
return(-sqrt(x + 3/2));
A = (0.847467,-1.53214);
B = (2.94997,2.10949);
P = (sqrt(3),0);
draw(graph(upperparab,-3/2,4));

draw(interp(A,B,-0.1)--interp(A,B,1.2));
dot("$A$", A, S);
dot("$B$", B, NW);
dot("$P$", P, SE);
[/asy]
Then the slope of $\overline{AB}$ is
\begin{aligned} \sqrt{3} &= \frac{b - a}{(b^2 - \frac{3}{2}) - (a^2 - \frac{3}{2})} \\
&= \frac{b - a}{b^2 - a^2} \\
&= \frac{b - a}{(b - a)(b + a)} \\
& = \frac{1}{a + b} \end{aligned}
\]The difference between the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $P$ is $a,$ so the difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $P$ is $\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}$
\[AP = \sqrt{a^2 + \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{3} a^2} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} a.\]Similarly,
\[BP = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} b.\]Therefore,
\[|AP - BP| = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} (a + b) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.\]
The inequality factors as
\[-(4x + 1)(x - 2) < 0.\]Therefore, the solution is $x \in \boxed{\left( -\infty, -\frac{1}{4} \right) \cup (2,\infty)}.$
Rationalizing the numerator, we get
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^2+2-\sqrt{x^4+4}}{x}\cdot\frac{x^2+2+\sqrt{x^4+4}}{x^2+2+\sqrt{x^4+4}}&=\frac{(x^2+2)^2-(x^4+4)}{x(x^2+2+\sqrt{x^4+4})}\\
&=\frac{4x^2}{x(x^2+2+\sqrt{x^4+4})}\\
&=\frac{4}{\frac{1}{x}(x^2+2+\sqrt{x^4+4})}\\
&=\frac{4}{x+\frac{2}{x}+\sqrt{x^2+\frac{4}{x^2}}}.
\end{align*}Since we wish to maximize this quantity, we wish to minimize the denominator
By AM-GM, $x+\frac{2}{x}\geq 2\sqrt{2}$ and $x^2+\frac{4}{x^2}\geq 4$, so that the denominator is at least $2\sqrt{2}+2$
Therefore, $$\frac{x^2+2-\sqrt{x^4+4}}{x}\leq \frac{4}{2\sqrt{2}+2}=\boxed{2\sqrt{2}-2},$$with equality when $x=\sqrt{2}$.
Let $a = OA = OB$ and $b = OC = OD.$  Then $a^2 - b^2 = OF^2 = 36.$

In general, if a right triangle has legs $x$ and $y,$ and hypotenuse $z,$ then its inradius is given by
\[\frac{x + y - z}{2}.\]Hence, the diameter of the incircle of triangle $OCF$ is
\[OC + OF - CF = 2.\]Then $b + 6 - a = 2,$ so $a - b = 4.$
By difference of squares on the equation $a^2 - b^2 = 36,$ $(a + b)(a - b) = 36,$ so
\[a + b = \frac{36}{a - b} = 9.\]With the equation $a - b = 4,$ we can solve to get $a = \frac{13}{2}$ and $b = \frac{5}{2}.$
Then $AB = 13$ and $CD = 5,$ so $(AB)(CD) = \boxed{65}.$
Let $p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d.$  Then from the given information,
\begin{align*}
a + b + c + d &= -7, \\
8a + 4b + 2c + d &= -9, \\
27a + 9b + 3c + d &= -15, \\
64a + 16b + 4c + d &= -31.
\end{align*}Subtracting the first and second equations, second and third equations, and third and fourth equations, we get
\begin{align*}
7a + 3b + c &= -2, \\
19a + 5b + c &= -6, \\
37a + 7b + c &= -16.
\end{align*}Again subtracting the equations in pairs, we get
\begin{align*}
12a + 2b &= -4, \\
18a + 2b &= -10.
\end{align*}Subtracting once more, we get $6a = -6,$ so $a = -1.$  Back-substituting gives us $b = 4,$ $c = -7,$ and $d = -3.$  Therefore,
\[p(x) = \boxed{-x^3 + 4x^2 - 7x - 3}.\]
Let $q(x) = p(x) - 1.$  Then $p(x) = q(x) + 1,$ so
\[(q(x) + 1)(q(y) + 1) = q(x) + 1 + q(y) + 1 + q(xy) + 1 - 2.\]Expanding, we get
\[q(x)q(y) + q(x) + q(y) + 1 = q(x) + q(y) + q(xy) + 1,\]so $q(xy) = q(x)q(y)$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y.$
Also, $q(2) = p(2) - 1 = 4 = 2^2.$  Then
\begin{align*}
q(2^2) &= q(2) q(2) = 2^2 \cdot 2^2 = 2^4, \\
q(2^3) &= q(2) q(2^2) = 2^2 \cdot 2^4 = 2^6, \\
q(2^4) &= q(2) q(2^3) = 2^2 \cdot 2^6 = 2^8,
\end{align*}and so on
\[q(2^n) = 2^{2n} = (2^n)^2\]for all positive integers $n.$
Since $q(x) = x^2$ for infinitely many values of $x,$ by the Identity Theorem, $q(x) = x^2$ for all $x.$  Hence, $p(x) = q(x) + 1 = \boxed{x^2 + 1}.$
Let $m = \log_b x$ and $n = \log_b y.$  Then $x = b^m$ and $y = b^n.$  Substituting into the first equation, we get
\[\sqrt{b^m \cdot b^n} = b^b,\]so $b^{m + n} = b^{2b},$ which implies $m + n = 2b.$
The second equation becomes
\[\log_b (b^{mn}) + \log_b (b^{mn}) = 4b^4,\]so $2mn = 4b^4,$ or $mn = 2b^4.$
By the Trivial Inequality, $(m - n)^2 \ge 0,$ so $m^2 - 2mn + n^2 \ge 0,$ which implies
\[m^2 + 2mn + n^2 \ge 4mn.\]Then $(2b)^2 \ge 8b^4,$ or $4b^2 \ge 8b^4.$  Then $b^2 \le \frac{1}{2},$ so the set of possible values of $b$ is $\boxed{\left( 0, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right]}.$
Substituting $z = -x - y,$ we get
\[\frac{x^5 + y^5 - (x + y)^5}{xy(-x - y)(xy - x(x + y) - y(x + y))}.\]Expanding the numerator and denominator, we get
\begin{align*}
-\frac{5x^4 y + 10x^3 y^2 + 10x^2 y^3 + 5xy^4}{xy(x + y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)} &= -\frac{5xy (x^3 + 2x^2 y + 2xy^2 + y^3)}{xy(x + y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)} \\
&= -\frac{5 (x^3 + 2x^2 y + 2xy^2 + y^3)}{(x + y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)} \\
&= -\frac{5 (x + y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)}{(x + y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)} \\
&= -5.
\end{align*}Hence, the only possible value of the expression is $\boxed{-5}.$
Since $1 \le \sqrt{1} < \sqrt{2} < \sqrt{3} < 2,$ the first three terms of the sum are equal to $1.$ Then, since $2 \le \sqrt{4} < \sqrt{5} < \dots < \sqrt{8} < 3,$ the next five terms equal $2.$ Then, since $3 \le \sqrt{9} < \sqrt{10} < \dots < \sqrt{15} < 4,$ the next seven terms equal $3.$ Finally, the last term equals $\lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4.$ So the overall sum is \[3(1) + 5(2) + 7(3) + 4 = 3 + 10 + 21 + 4 = \boxed{38}.\]
We first simplify each smaller fractional expression, by multiplying by the conjugate of the denominator: \[\frac{1}{\sqrt2+1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt2+1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt2-1}{\sqrt2-1} = \sqrt2-1\]and \[\frac{2}{\sqrt3-1} = \frac{2}{\sqrt3-1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt3+1}{\sqrt3+1} = \sqrt3+1.\]Therefore, the given expression becomes \[\frac{1}{(\sqrt2-1)+(\sqrt3+1)} = \frac1{\sqrt2+\sqrt3}.\]Multiplying by the conjugate one more time, we have \[\frac1{\sqrt2+\sqrt3} = \frac1{\sqrt2+\sqrt3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt3-\sqrt2}{\sqrt3-\sqrt2} = \boxed{\sqrt3-\sqrt2}.\]
Let the roots be $-r_1,$ $-r_2,$ $-r_3,$ $-r_4,$ so all the $r_i$ are positive integers
\[f(x) = (x + r_1)(x + r_2)(x + r_3)(x + r_4),\]and $f(1) = (1 + r_1)(1 + r_2)(1 + r_3)(1 + r_4).$  Also, $f(1) = 1 + a + b + c + d = 2010.$  The prime factorization of 2010 is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 67,$ so $1 + r_1,$ $1 + r_2,$ $1 + r_3$, and $1 + r_4$ are equal to 2, 3, 5, and 67, in some order
Therefore,
\[f(x) = (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 4)(x + 66),\]and $d = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 66 = \boxed{528}.$
Let $a = 1999$ and $b = 2000.$  Then
\begin{align*}
2000^3 - 1999 \cdot 2000^2 - 1999^2 \cdot 2000 + 1999^3 &= b^3 - ab^2 - a^2 b + a^3 \\
&= b^2 (b - a) - a^2 (b - a) \\
&= (b^2 - a^2)(b - a) \\
&= (b + a)(b - a)(b - a) \\
&= \boxed{3999}.
\end{align*}
Since all parabolas are similar, we may assume that $\mathcal P$ is the curve $y = x^2,$ so $V_1 = (0,0).$  Then, if $A = (a, a^2)$ and $B = (b, b^2)$, the slope of line $AV_1$ is $a,$ and the slope of line $BV_1$ is $b.$  Since $\angle AV_1 B = 90^\circ,$ $ab = -1$
Then, the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ is \[
\left( \frac{a+b}{2}, \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{a+b}{2}, \frac{(a+b)^2 - 2ab}{2} \right)
= \left( \frac{a+b}{2}, \frac{(a+b)^2}{2} + 1 \right).
\](Note that $a+b$ can range over all real numbers under the constraint $ab = - 1$.) It follows that the locus of the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ is the curve $y = 2x^2 + 1$.
Recall that the focus of $y = ax^2$ is $\left(0, \frac{1}{4a} \right)$
We find that $V_1 = (0,0)$, $V_2 = (0,1)$, $F_1 = \left( 0, \frac 14 \right)$, $F_2 = \left( 0, 1 + \frac18 \right)$
Therefore, $\frac{F_1F_2}{V_1V_2} = \boxed{\frac78}$.
The second equation factors as $(xy + 1)(x + y) = 63,$ so $7(x + y) = 63,$ or $x + y = 9.$  Then
\[x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = 9^2 - 2 \cdot 6 = \boxed{69}.\]
For $x \le -5,$
\[|x + 2| + |x + 4| + |x + 5| = -(x + 2) - (x + 4) - (x + 5) = -3x - 11.\]For $-5 \le x \le -4,$
\[|x + 2| + |x + 4| + |x + 5| = -(x + 2) - (x + 4) + (x + 5) = -x - 1.\]For $-4 \le x \le -2,$
\[|x + 2| + |x + 4| + |x + 5| = -(x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 5) = x + 7.\]For $x \ge -2,$
\[|x + 2| + |x + 4| + |x + 5| = (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 5) = 3x + 11.\]Thus, the function is decreasing on $(-\infty,4]$ and increasing on $[4,\infty),$ so the minimum value occurs at $x = -4,$ which is $\boxed{3}.$
Switching the roles of $x$ and $y,$ we get
\[f(y + x) = 3^x f(y) + 2^y f(x).\]Hence,
\[3^y f(x) + 2^x f(y) = 3^x f(y) + 2^y f(x).\]Then
\[(3^y - 2^y) f(x) = (3^x - 2^x) f(y),\]so for $x \neq 0$ and $y \neq 0,$
\[\frac{f(x)}{3^x - 2^x} = \frac{f(y)}{3^y - 2^y}.\]Setting $y = 1,$ we get
\[\frac{f(x)}{3^x - 2^x} = \frac{f(1)}{3^1 - 2^1} = 1,\]so $f(x) = \boxed{3^x - 2^x}.$  Note that this formula also holds for $x = 0.$
We can consider $xy (72 - 3x - 4y)$ as the product of $x,$ $y,$ and $72 - 3x - 4y.$  Unfortunately, their sum is not constant.
In order to obtain a constant sum, we consider $(3x)(4y)(72 - 3x - 4y).$  By AM-GM,
\[\sqrt[3]{(3x)(4y)(72 - 3x - 4y)} \le \frac{3x + 4y + (72 - 3x - 4y)}{3} = \frac{72}{3} = 24,\]so $(3x)(4y)(72 - 3x - 4y) \le 13824.$  Then
\[xy(72 - 3x - 4y) \le 1152.\]Equality occurs when $3x = 4y = 72 - 3x - 4y.$  We can solve to get $x = 8$ and $y = 6,$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{1152}.$
If $x^2 + x - n$ factors as the product of two linear factors with integer coefficients, then it must be of the form
\[(x - a)(x - b) = x^2 - (a + b)x + ab,\]where $a$ and $b$ are integers
Then $a + b = -1$ and $ab = -n$, which means $n = -ab = -a(-a - 1) = a(a + 1).$  We want $1 \le n \le 1000.$  The possible values of $a$ are then 1, 2, $\dots,$ 31, so there are $\boxed{31}$ possible values of $n.$  (Note that $a$ can also be $-32,$ $-31,$ $\dots,$ $-2,$ but these give the same values of $n.$)
By partial fractions,
\[\frac{1}{m(m + n + 1)} = \frac{1}{n + 1} \left( \frac{1}{m} - \frac{1}{m + n + 1} \right).\]Thus,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m(m + n + 1)} &= \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 1} \left( \frac{1}{m} - \frac{1}{m + n + 1} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{n + 1} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n + 2} \right) + \frac{1}{n + 1} \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{n + 3} \right) \\
&\quad + \frac{1}{n + 1} \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{n + 4} \right) + \frac{1}{n + 1} \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{n + 5} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \frac{1}{n + 1} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \dots + \frac{1}{n + 1} \right).
\end{align*}Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{m = 1}^\infty \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{mn(m + n + 1)} &= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n(n + 1)} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \dots + \frac{1}{n + 1} \right) \\
&= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n(n + 1)} \sum_{k = 1}^{n + 1} \frac{1}{k} \\
&= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^{n + 1} \frac{1}{kn(n + 1)} \\
&= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n(n + 1)} + \sum_{k = 2}^{n + 1} \frac{1}{kn(n + 1)} \right) \\
&= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n(n + 1)} + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 2}^{n + 1} \frac{1}{kn(n + 1)}.
\end{align*}The first sum telescopes as
\[\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n + 1} \right) = 1.\]For the second sum, we are summing over all positive integers $k$ and $n$ such that $2 \le k \le n + 1.$  In other words, we sum over $k \ge 2$ and $n \ge k - 1,$ which gives us
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k = 2}^\infty \sum_{n = k - 1}^\infty \frac{1}{kn(n + 1)} &= \sum_{k = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{k} \sum_{n = k - 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n(n + 1)} \\
&= \sum_{k = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{k} \sum_{n = k - 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n + 1} \right) \\
&= \sum_{k = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{k} \cdot \frac{1}{k - 1} \\
&= \sum_{k = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{k - 1} - \frac{1}{k} \right) \\
\end{align*}Therefore,
\[\sum_{m = 1}^\infty \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{mn(m + n + 1)} = \boxed{2}.\]
We can write the given equation as
\[z^2 - 4z = -19 + 8i.\]Then $z^2 - 4z + 4 = -15 + 8i,$ so $(z - 2)^2 = -15 + 8i.$
Let $-15 + 8i = (a + bi)^2,$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers
Expanding, we get
\[-15 + 8i = a^2 + 2abi - b^2.\]Setting the real and imaginary parts equal, we get $a^2 - b^2 = -15$ and $ab = 4.$  Hence, $b = \frac{4}{a},$ so
\[a^2 - \frac{16}{a^2} = -15.\]Then $a^4 - 16 = -15a^2,$ so $a^4 + 15a^2 - 16 = 0.$  This factors as $(a^2 - 1)(a^2 + 16) = 0.$  Since $a$ is real, $a = \pm 1,$ which leads to $b = \pm 4.$  Thus,
\[z - 2 = \pm (1 + 4i),\]Then $z = 3 + 4i$ or $z = 1 - 4i.$  Only $\boxed{3 + 4i}$ has an integer magnitude.
\[y = \sqrt{x} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}.\]Then
\[y^2 = x + 2 + \frac{1}{x} = 98 + 2 = 100.\]Since $\sqrt{x} \ge 0$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \ge 0,$ we must have $y \ge 0.$  Therefore, $y = \boxed{10}.$
Let the other 2010 numbers be $y_1,$ $y_2,$ $\dots,$ $y_{2010}.$  Then $y_1 +y_2 + \dots + y_{2010} = 2012 - x$ and $\frac{1}{y_1} + \frac{1}{y_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{y_{2010}} = 2012 - \frac{1}{x}.$  By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{2010} y_i \right) \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{2010} \frac{1}{y_i} \right) = (2012 - x) \left( 2012 - \frac{1}{x} \right) \ge 2010^2.\]Then $2012^2 - 2012 \left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right) + 1 \ge 2010^2,$ which leads to
\[x + \frac{1}{x} \le \frac{8045}{2012}.\]The equation $x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{8045}{2012}$ reduces to $x^2 - \frac{8045}{2012} x + 1 = 0,$ which has real roots
We can then set $y_i = \frac{2012 - x}{2010}$ in order to achieve equality
Thus, the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{8045}{2012}}.$
We guess that $\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{5}$ is also a root of $P(x).$ In that case, $P(x)$ must be divisible by the polynomial \[(x-(\sqrt2+\sqrt5))(x-(\sqrt2-\sqrt5)) =  x^2 - 2x\sqrt{2} - 3.\]Now we see that if we multiply this polynomial by $ x^2 + 2x\sqrt{2} - 3,$ we get a polynomial with rational coefficients: \[( x^2 - 2x\sqrt{2} - 3)( x^2 + 2x\sqrt{2} - 3)=x^4-14x^2+9.\]Therefore, $P(x) = x^4-14x^2+9,$ and so $P(1)=1-14+9=\boxed{-4}.$
Setting $x = 4$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[f(4) + 2f(-3) = 48.\]Setting $x = -3$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[f(-3) + 2f(4) = 27.\]Doubling the second equation, we get $2f(-3) + 4f(4) = 54.$  Subtracting the equation $f(4) + 2f(-3) = 48,$ we get $3f(4) = 6,$ so $f(4) = \boxed{2}.$
Let $F_1 = (3, -4)$ and $F_2 = (-5, 8)$
Then, given a point $P = (x, y)$, we can rewrite the given equation as \[PF_1 + PF_2 = 20\]by the distance formula
Therefore, the ellipse has foci $F_1$ and $F_2$, and so the answer is \[F_1F_2 = \sqrt{(3+5)^2 + (-4-8)^2} = \sqrt{8^2 + 12^2} = \boxed{4\sqrt{13}}.\]
We can start by taking out a factor of $\frac{1}{9}$ out of each term in $B$:
\[B = \frac{1}{9} \left( \frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{5^2} - \frac{1}{7^2} + \frac{1}{9^2} - \frac{1}{11^2} + \dotsb \right).\]Note that we obtain all the terms in $A,$ so
\[B = \frac{1}{9} A + \frac{1}{9} \left( -\frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{9^2} - \frac{1}{15^2} + \frac{1}{21^2} - \dotsb \right) = \frac{1}{9} A + \frac{1}{9} (-B).\]Then $9B = A - B,$ so $A = 10B.$  Therefore, $\frac{A}{B} = \boxed{10}.$
From the equation $\omega^7 = 1,$ $\omega^7 - 1 = 0,$ which factors as
\[(\omega - 1)(\omega^6 + \omega^5 + \omega^4 + \omega^3 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0.\]Since $\omega \neq 1,$
\[\omega^6 + \omega^5 + \omega^4 + \omega^3 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0.\]We have that
\[\alpha + \beta = \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^4 + \omega^3 + \omega^5 + \omega^6 = -1.\]Also,
\begin{align*}
\alpha \beta &= (\omega + \omega^2 + \omega^4)(\omega^3 + \omega^5 + \omega^6) \\
&= \omega^4 + \omega^6 + \omega^7 + \omega^5 + \omega^7 + \omega^8 + \omega^7 + \omega^9 + \omega^{10} \\
&= \omega^4 + \omega^6 + 1 + \omega^5 + 1 + \omega + 1 + \omega^2 + \omega^3 \\
&= 2 + (\omega^6 + \omega^5 + \omega^4 + \omega^3 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1) \\
\end{align*}Then by Vieta's formulas, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the roots of $x^2 + x + 2 = 0,$ so $(a,b) = \boxed{(1,2)}.$
Squaring the equation $4 = a+a^{-1},$ we get \[16 = \left(a+a^{-1}\right)^2 = a^2 + 2a a^{-1} + a^{-2} = a^2 + 2 + a^{-2},\]so $14 = a^2 + a^{-2}.$ To get the desired expression, we square again, giving \[196 = a^4 + 2a^2 a^{-2} + a^{-4} = a^4 + 2 + a^{-4}.\]Thus, $\boxed{194} = a^4 + a^{-4}.$
The equation of the line passing through $Q = (20,14)$ with slope $m$ is $y - 14 = m(x - 20).$  Thus, we seek the values of $m$ for which the system
\begin{align*}
y - 14 &= m(x - 20), \\
y &= x^2
\end{align*}has no real solutions.
Substituting $y = x^2$ into the first equation, we get
\[x^2 - 14 = m(x - 20).\]Then $x^2 - mx + (20m - 14) = 0.$  This equation has no real solutions when the discriminant is negative:
\[m^2 - 4(20m - 14) < 0.\]Then $m^2 - 80m + 56 < 0.$  Thus, $r$ and $s$ are the roots of $m^2 - 80m + 56 = 0.$  By Vieta's formulas, $r + s = \boxed{80}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
z^2 &= \left( \frac{-\sqrt{3} + i}{2} \right)^2 \\
&= \frac{3 - 2i \sqrt{3} + i^2}{4} = \frac{3 - 2i \sqrt{3} - 1}{4} \\
&= \frac{2 - 2i \sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{1 - i \sqrt{3}}{2}.
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
z^3 &= z \cdot z^2 \\
&= \frac{-\sqrt{3} + i}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - i \sqrt{3}}{2} \\
&= \frac{-\sqrt{3} + 3i + i - i^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} \\
&= \frac{-\sqrt{3} + 4i + \sqrt{3}}{4} \\
\end{align*}Hence, $z^6 = i^2 = \boxed{-1}.$
We expand the expression on the left and attempt to match up the coefficients with those in the expression on the right
\begin{align*}
(x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d) = x^4+cx^3 \ +& \ dx^2 \\
ax^3 \ +& \ acx^2+adx \\
\ +& \ \ bx^2 \ +bcx+bd
\end{align*} $$=x^4+x^3-2x^2+17x-5$$ So we have $a+c=1$, $ac+b+d=-2$, $ad+bc=17$, $bd=-5$.
From the final equation, we know that either $b=1, d=-5$ or $b=-1, d=5$
We test each case:
If $b=1, d=-5$, then $ac+b+d=ac-4=-2$, so $ac=2$
We substitute $a=1-c$ from the first equation to get the quadratic $c^2-c+2=0$
This equation does not have any integer solutions, as we can test by finding that the discriminant is less than zero, $(-1)^2-4(1)(2)=-7$.
If $b=-1, d=5$, then $ac+b+d=ac+4=-2$, so $ac=-6$
We substitute $a=1-c$ from the first equation to get the quadratic $c^2-c-6=0$, which has solutions $c=-2$ (so $a=3$) or $c=3$ (so $a=-2$)
In either case, we get that $a+b+c+d=\boxed{5}$.
The remaining equation, $ad + bc = 17$, tells us that the coefficients are $a = 3, b = -1, c = -2, d = 5.$
Let $A = (a,a^2 - 9a + 25)$ be a point on the parabola $y = x^2 - 9x + 25.$  Then the distance from $A$ to line $x - y - 8 = 0$ is
\begin{align*}
\frac{|a - (a^2 - 9a + 25) - 8|}{\sqrt{2}} &= \frac{|-a^2 + 10a - 33|}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&= \frac{|a^2 - 10a + 33|}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&= \frac{|(a - 5)^2 + 8|}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{align*}We see that $(a - 5)^2 + 8$ is minimized when $a = 5,$ and the minimum distance is $\frac{8}{\sqrt{2}} = \boxed{4 \sqrt{2}}.$
Since $a,$ $b,$ $c$ form a geometric sequence, $b = \sqrt{ac}.$  Then the three logarithms become
\[\log_c a, \ \log_{\sqrt{ac}} c, \ \log_a \sqrt{ac}.\]Let $x = \log_c a.$  Then by the change-of-base formula,
\[\log_{\sqrt{ac}} c = \frac{\log_c c}{\log_c \sqrt{ac}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} \log_c ac} = \frac{2}{\log_c a + \log_c c} = \frac{2}{x + 1},\]and
\[\log_a \sqrt{ac} = \frac{1}{2} \log_a ac = \frac{\log_c ac}{2 \log_c a} = \frac{\log_c a + \log_c c}{2 \log_c a} = \frac{x + 1}{2x}.\]Let $d$ be the common difference, so
\[d = \frac{2}{x + 1} - x = \frac{x + 1}{2x} - \frac{2}{x + 1}.\]Then
\[4x - 2x^2 (x + 1) = (x + 1)^2 - 4x,\]which simplifies to $2x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.$  This factors as $(x - 1)(2x^2 + 5x - 1) = 0.$
If $x = 1,$ then $\log_c a = 1,$ so $a = c.$  But $a$ and $c$ are distinct, so $2x^2 + 5x - 1 = 0,$ so $x^2 = \frac{1 - 5x}{2}.$ Then
\[d = \frac{2}{x + 1} - x = \frac{2 - x^2 - x}{x + 1} = \frac{2 - \frac{1 - 5x}{2} - x}{x + 1} = \frac{3x + 3}{2(x + 1)} = \boxed{\frac{3}{2}}.\]
We place the points on a coordinate system: $D$ at the origin, $C$ and $A$ on the positive $x$- and $y$-axes, respectively
Then the circle centered at $M$ has equation \[(x-2)^{2} + y^{2} = 4\]and the circle centered at $A$ has equation \[x^{2} + (y-4)^{2} = 16.\]Solving these equations for the coordinates of $P$ gives $x=16/5$ and $y=8/5$, so the answer is $\boxed{16/5}$.

We also could have solved this problem with a little trigonometry:
Let $\angle MAD = \alpha$
Then \begin{align*}
PQ &= (PA)\sin(\angle PAQ) \\
&= 4\sin(2\alpha) \\
&= 8 \sin\alpha\cos\alpha\\
&= 8\displaystyle\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{20}}\right)\left(\frac{4}{\sqrt{20}}\displaystyle\right)\\
&=\boxed{\frac{16}{5}}.
\end{align*}
Note that
\[\frac{1}{n^2-4} = \frac{1}{(n-2)(n+2)} = \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{n-2} - \frac{1}{n+2}\right).\]Thus, the given sum telescopes: \[\begin{aligned} 1000\sum_{n=3}^{10000}\frac1{n^2-4} &= 1000 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \sum_{n=3}^{10000} \left(\frac{1}{n-2} - \frac{1}{n+2}\right) \\ & = 250 \left(\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9999} - \frac{1}{10000} - \frac{1}{10001} - \frac{1}{10002}\right) \\ &= 250 + 125 + 83.\overline{3} + 62.5 - \varepsilon \end{aligned}\]where $\varepsilon = 250\left(\tfrac{1}{9999}+\tfrac{1}{10000}+\tfrac{1}{10001}+\tfrac{1}{10002}\right)$
This simplifies to $520.8\overline{3} - \varepsilon$, and so the answer is $\boxed{521}.$
(To check that $\varepsilon$ is small enough to not affect the answer, we can write $\varepsilon < 250 \cdot 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5000} = 0.2$
This shows that the sum lies between $520.8\overline{3}$ and $520.6\overline{3}$, and so the closest integer is indeed $521$, as stated before.)
The condition $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ implies that $a_n$ and $a_{n+3}$ have the same parity for all $n\geq 1$
Because $a_{2006}$ is odd, $a_2$ is also odd
Because $a_{2006}=1$ and $a_n$ is a multiple of $\gcd(a_1,a_2)$ for all $n$, it follows that $1=\gcd(a_1,a_2)=\gcd(3^3\cdot 37,a_2)$
There are 499 odd integers in the interval $[1,998]$, of which 166 are multiples of 3, 13 are multiples of 37, and 4 are multiples of $3\cdot 37=111$
By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of possible values of $a_2$ cannot exceed $499-166-13+4=\boxed{324}$.
To see that there are actually 324 possibilities, note that for $n\geq 3$, $a_n<\max(a_{n-2},a_{n-1})$ whenever $a_{n-2}$ and $a_{n-1}$ are both positive
Thus $a_N=0$ for some $N\leq 1999$
If $\gcd(a_1,a_2)=1$, then $a_{N-2}=a_{N-1}=1$, and for $n>N$ the sequence cycles through the values 1, 1, 0
If in addition $a_2$ is odd, then $a_{3k+2}$ is odd for $k\geq 1$, so $a_{2006}=1$.
Substituting the definition of $f$ and $g$ into $h(x) = f(g(x))$, we get $h(x) = ag(x) + b = a(-3x+5)+b = -3ax + (5a+b)$.
Since $h^{-1}(x)$ is given by adding 7 to $x$, the inverse of $h^{-1}$ is given by subtracting 7
Therefore $h(x)=x-7$
We can test this by substiting \[h(h^{-1}(x))=(x+7)-7=x.\]Combining these two expressions for $h$ we get  \[ -3ax + (5a+b)=x-7.\]From here we could solve for $a$ and $b$ and find $a-b$, but we notice that the substitution $x=2$ gives \[-6a+(5a+b)=2-7\]or \[b-a=-5.\]Therefore $a-b=\boxed{5}$.
We have that
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n \sqrt{n - 1} + (n - 1) \sqrt{n}} &= \frac{n \sqrt{n - 1} - (n - 1) \sqrt{n}}{(n \sqrt{n - 1} + (n - 1) \sqrt{n})(n \sqrt{n - 1} - (n - 1) \sqrt{n})} \\
&= \frac{n \sqrt{n - 1} - (n - 1) \sqrt{n}}{n^2 (n - 1) - (n - 1)^2 n} \\
&= \frac{n \sqrt{n - 1} - (n - 1) \sqrt{n}}{n(n - 1)(n - (n - 1))} \\
&= \frac{n \sqrt{n - 1} - (n - 1) \sqrt{n}}{n(n - 1)} \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{n - 1}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}.
\end{align*}Thus,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 2}^{10000} \frac{1}{n \sqrt{n - 1} + (n - 1) \sqrt{n}} &= \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{4}} \right) + \dots + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{9999}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{10000}} \right) \\
&= 1 - \frac{1}{100} = \boxed{\frac{99}{100}}.
\end{align*}
Let $P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.$  Then
\[a(x^3 + x)^2 + b(x^3 + x) + c \ge a(x^2 + 1)^2 + b(x^2 + 1) + c\]for all real numbers $x.$  This simplifies to
\[ax^6 + ax^4 + bx^3 - (a + b)x^2 + bx - a - b \ge 0.\]This factors as
\[(x - 1)(x^2 + 1)(ax^3 + ax^2 + ax + a + b) \ge 0.\]For this inequality to hold for all real numbers $x,$ $ax^3 + ax^2 + ax + a + b$ must have a factor of $x - 1.$  (Otherwise, as $x$ increases from just below 1 to just above 1, $x - 1$ changes sign, but $(x^2 + 1)(ax^3 + ax^2 + ax + a + b)$ does not, meaning that it cannot be nonnegative for all real numbers $x.$)  Hence, setting $x = 1,$ we get $a + a + a + a + b = 0,$ so $4a + b = 0.$
Then by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-\frac{b}{a} = \boxed{4}.$
Define a new sequence $(b_n)$ such that $a_n = 2^n b_n$ for each $n.$ Then the recurrence becomes \[2^{n+1} b_{n+1} = \frac{8}{5} \cdot 2^n b_n + \frac{6}{5} \sqrt{4^n - 4^n b_n^2} = \frac{8}{5} \cdot 2^n b_n + \frac{6}{5} \cdot 2^n \sqrt{1 - b_n^2},\]or, dividing by $2^{n+1},$ \[b_{n+1} = \frac{4}{5} b_n + \frac{3}{5} \sqrt{1-b_n^2}.\]Compute by hand: \[\begin{aligned}
b_1 & = \frac 35
b_2 & = \frac 45\cdot \frac 35 + \frac 35 \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac 35\right)^2} = \frac{24}{25}
b_3 & = \frac 45\cdot \frac {24}{25} + \frac 35 \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac {24}{25}\right)^2} = \frac{96}{125} + \frac 35\cdot\frac 7{25} = \frac{117}{125}
b_4 & = \frac 45\cdot \frac {117}{125} + \frac 35 \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac {117}{125}\right)^2} = \frac{468}{625} + \frac 35\cdot\frac {44}{125} = \frac{600}{625} = \frac{24}{25} \end{aligned}\]Since $b_2 = b_4,$ the sequence $(b_n)$ starts to repeat with period $2.$ Thus, $b_{10} = b_2 = \frac{24}{25},$ so $a_{10} = 2^{10} b_{10} = \frac{2^{10} \cdot 24}{25} = \boxed{\frac{24576}{25}}.$
Setting $x = y = z = 0,$ we get
\[f(0) + f(0) - f(0)^2 \ge 1,\]so $f(0)^2 - 2f(0) + 1 \le 0.$  Then $(f(0) - 1)^2 \le 0,$ which forces $f(0) = 1.$
Setting $x = y = z = 1,$ we get
\[f(1) + f(1) - f(1)^2 \ge 1,\]so $f(1)^2 - 2f(1) + 1 \le 0.$  Then $(f(1) - 1)^2 \le 0,$ which forces $f(1) = 1.$
Setting $y = z = 0,$ we get
\[f(0) + f(0) - f(x) f(0) \ge 1,\]so $f(x) \le 1$ for all $x.$
Setting $y = z = 1,$ we get
\[f(x) + f(x) - f(x) f(1) \ge 1,\]so $f(x) \ge 1$ for all $x.$
This tells us that the only possible function is $f(x) = 1.$  We readily see that this function works, so there is only $\boxed{1}$ possible function $f(x).$
In general, if we have fractions $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d},$ then
\[\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a + c}{b + d}.\]To see why, let $k = \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}.$  Then $a = kb$ and $c = kd,$ so
\[\frac{a + c}{b + d} = \frac{kb + kd}{b + d} = k.\]Applying this here, we get
\[\frac{7}{x + y} = \frac{11}{z - y} = \frac{7 + 11}{(x + y) + (z - y)} = \frac{18}{x + z}.\]Hence, $k = \boxed{18}.$
Assume $k \neq 0.$  Then
\[x + 2 = x(kx - 1) = kx^2 - x,\]so $kx^2 - 2x - 2 = 0.$  This quadratic has exactly one solution if its discriminant is 0, or $(-2)^2 - 4(k)(-2) = 4 + 8k = 0.$  Then $k = -\frac{1}{2}.$  But then
\[-\frac{1}{2} x^2 - 2x - 2 = 0,\]or $x^2 + 4x + 4 = (x + 2)^2 = 0,$ which means $x = -2,$ and
\[\frac{x + 2}{kx - 1} = \frac{x + 2}{-\frac{1}{2} x - 1}\]is not defined for $x = -2.$
So, we must have $k = 0.$  For $k = 0,$ the equation is
\[\frac{x + 2}{-1} = x,\]which yields $x = -1.$  Hence, $k = \boxed{0}$ is the value we seek.
We can write $(x + 1)^{2010} = [(x + 1)^2]^{1005} = (x^2 + 2x + 1)^{1005}.$  This leaves the same remainder as $x^{1005}$ when divided by $x^2 + x + 1.$
Then $x^{1005} - 1= (x^3)^{335} - 1$ is divisible by $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1).$  Therefore, the remainder when $(x + 1)^{2010}$ is divided by $x^2 + x + 1$ is $\boxed{1}.$
By Factor Theorem, we want $[p(x)]^3 - x$ to be equal to 0 at $x = 1,$ $x = -1,$ and $x = 8.$  Thus, $p(1) = 1,$ $p(-1) = -1,$ and $p(8) = 2.$
Since $p(x)$ is quadratic, let $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.$  Then
\begin{align*}
a + b + c &= 1, \\
a - b + c &= -1, \\
64a + 8b + c &= 2.
\end{align*}Solving this system, we find $a = -\frac{2}{21},$ $b = 1,$ and $c = \frac{2}{21}.$  Hence,
\[p(x) = -\frac{2}{21} x^2 + x + \frac{2}{21},\]so $p(13) = -\frac{2}{21} \cdot 13^2 + 13 + \frac{2}{21} = \boxed{-3}.$
Notice that every term $b_n$ will be a power of 2, the exponent of which will be the sum of the exponents of the two previous terms
Therefore, let us construct a sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots$, such that $a_1 = 0$, and $a_2 = 1$, and $a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n-1}$
Of course, $a_{20}$ is simply equivalent to the 19th term of the Fibonacci Sequence, 4181
Thus, $b_{20} = 2^{a_{20}} = \boxed{2^{4181}}$.
By Factor Theorem,
\[f(x) = (x - r - 1)(x - r - 7)(x - a)\]and
\[g(x) = (x - r - 3)(x - r - 9)(x - b)\]for some real numbers $a$ and $b.$
\[f(x) - g(x) = (x - r - 1)(x - r - 7)(x - a) - (x - r - 3)(x - r - 9)(x - b) = r\]for all $x.$
Setting $x = r + 3,$ we get
\[(2)(-4)(r + 3 - a) = r.\]Setting $x = r + 9,$ we get
\[(8)(2)(r + 9 - a) = r.\]Then $-8r - 24 + 8a = r$ and $16r + 144 - 16a = r,$ so
\begin{align*}
8a - 9r &= 24, \\
-16a + 15r &= -144.
\end{align*}Solving, we find $r = \boxed{32}.$
If $x^{101} + Ax + B$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1,$ then $x^{101} + Ax + B$ must be equal to 0 any time $x$ is a root of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0.$
Let $\omega$ be a root of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0,$ so $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0.$  Then
\[(\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0,\]or $\omega^3 - 1 = 0,$ which means $\omega^3 = 1.$
By the Factor Theorem,
\[\omega^{101} + A \omega + B = 0.\]We have that $\omega^{101} = \omega^{3 \cdot 33 + 2} = (\omega^3)^{33} \cdot \omega^2 = \omega^2,$ so
\begin{align*}
\omega^{101} + A \omega + B &= \omega^2 + A \omega + B \\
&= (-\omega - 1) + A \omega + B \\
&= (A - 1) \omega + (B - 1) \\
\end{align*}Since $\omega$ is a nonreal complex number, we must have $A = 1$ and $B = 1,$ so $A + B = \boxed{2}.$
We have $f_1(x) = \frac{2(3x+1) - 9}{3(3x+1)} = \frac{6x-7}{9x+3}.$ We compute the first few $f_n,$ hoping to see a pattern: \[\begin{aligned} f_2(x) &= f_1\left(\frac{6x-7}{9x+3}\right) = \frac{6 \cdot \frac{6x-7}{9x+3}-7}{9\cdot\frac{6x-7}{9x+3}+3} = \frac{6(6x-7) - 7(9x+3)}{9(6x-7)+3(9x+3)} = \frac{-27x-63}{81x-54} = \frac{-3x-7}{9x-6},\\ f_3(x) &= f_1\left(\frac{-3x-7}{9x-6}\right) = \frac{6 \cdot \frac{-3x-7}{9x-6}-7}{9 \cdot \frac{-3x-7}{9x-6}+3} = \frac{6(-3x-7) - 7(9x-6)}{9(-3x-7) + 3(9x-6)} = \frac{-81x}{-81} = x
\end{aligned} \]Since $f_3(x) = x$ for all $x,$ we see that $f_k(x) = f_{k-3}(x)$ for all $x.$ Since $1001 \equiv 2 \pmod 3,$ we have \[f_{1001}(x) = f_2(x) = \frac{-3x-7}{9x-6} = x-3,\]so \[\begin{aligned} -3x-7& = 9x^2 - 33x + 18 \\ 0 &= 9x^2 - 30x + 25 = (3x-5)^2
\end{aligned}\]Thus, $x = \boxed{\tfrac{5}{3}}.$
Consider a quartic equation of the form $x^4 - 2px^2 + q = 0,$ where $p$ and $q$ are nonnegative real numbers
We can re-write this equation as
\[(x^2 - p)^2 = p^2 - q.\]$\bullet$ If $p^2 - q < 0,$ then there will be 0 real roots.
$\bullet$ If $p^2 - q = 0$ and $p = 0$ (so $p = q = 0$), then there will be 1 real root, namely $x = 0.$
$\bullet$ If $p^2 - q = 0$ and $p > 0$, then there will be 2 real roots, namely $x = \pm \sqrt{p}.$
$\bullet$ If $p^2 - q > 0$ and $q = 0$, then there will be 3 real roots, namely $x = 0$ and $x = \pm \sqrt{2p}.$
$\bullet$ If $p^2 - q > 0$ and $q > 0$, then there will be 4 real roots, namely $x = \pm \sqrt{p \pm \sqrt{p^2 - 1}}.$
Using these cases, we can compute the first few values of $a_n$:
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}
n & p = a_{n - 1} & q = a_{n - 2} a_{n - 3} & p^2 - q & a_n \\ \hline
4 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 2 \\
5 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 4 \\
6 & 4 & 2 & 14 & 4 \\
7 & 4 & 8 & 8 & 4 \\
8 & 4 & 16 & 0 & 2 \\
9 & 2 & 16 & -12 & 0 \\
10 & 0 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\
11 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
12 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 3 \\
13 & 3 & 0 & 9 & 3 \\
14 & 3 & 3 & 6 & 4 \\
15 & 4 & 9 & 7 & 4 \\
16 & 4 & 12 & 4 & 4
\end{array}
\]Since $a_{16} = a_7,$ $a_{15} = a_6,$ and $a_{14} = a_5,$ and each term $a_n$ depends only on the previous three terms, the sequence becomes periodic from here on, with a period of $(4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3).$  Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 1}^{1000} a_n &= a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + (a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{13}) \\
&\quad + \dots + (a_{986} + a_{987} + a_{988} + a_{989} + a_{990} + a_{991} + a_{992} + a_{993} + a_{994}) \\
&\quad + a_{995} + a_{996} + a_{997} + a_{998} + a_{999} + a_{1000} \\
&= 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 110(4 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 3) + 4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 0 \\
&= \boxed{2329}.
\end{align*}
From $\lceil x \rceil = 11,$ we get $10 < x \le 11.$ Therefore, $100 < x \le 121,$ so the possible values of $x$ are $101, 102, \dots, 121.$ Therefore, the number of possible values of $x$ is $121 - 101 + 1 = \boxed{21}.$
Note that \[\frac{r}{\frac{1}{r}+st} = \frac{r^2}{1+rst} = \frac{r^2}{1+7} = \frac{r^2}{8},\]since $rst=7$ by Vieta's formulas
By similar computations, we get \[\frac{r}{\frac{1}{r}+st} + \frac{s}{\frac{1}{s}+tr} + \frac{t}{\frac{1}{t}+rs} = \frac{r^2+s^2+t^2}{8},\]which equals \[\frac{(r+s+t)^2 - 2(rs+st+tr)}{8}=\frac{20^2 - 2\cdot 18}{8} = \boxed{\frac{91}{2}}.\]
By the Remainder Theorem, we can find the remainder by setting $x = -2.$  This gives us a remainder of $(-2)^3 - 3(-2) + 5 = \boxed{3}.$
We can express the sum as
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 1}^{100} (-1)^n \sum_{k = (n - 1)^2 + 1}^{n^2} k &= \sum_{n = 1}^{100} (-1)^n \cdot \frac{(n - 1)^2 + 1 + n^2}{2} \cdot (2n - 1) \\
&= \sum_{n = 1}^{100} (-1)^n (2n^3 - 3n^ 2+ 3n - 1) \\
&= \sum_{n = 1}^{100} (-1)^n (n^3 + (n - 1)^3) \\
&= -0^3 - 1^3 + 1^3 + 2^3 - 2^3 - 3^3 + \dots + 99^3 + 100^3 \\
&= \boxed{1000000}.
\end{align*}
Applying $f$ to both sides of the equation $f^{-1}(x) = f((2x)^{-1})$, we get $f(f^{-1}(x)) = f(f((2x)^{-1}))$
By definition of the inverse function, $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$, and \[f(f((2x)^{-1})) = f \left( f \left( \frac{1}{2x} \right) \right) = f \left( \frac{16}{2x} + 3 \right) = f \left( \frac{8}{x} + 3 \right) = f \left( \frac{3x + 8}{x} \right) = 16 \cdot \frac{3x + 8}{x} + 3 = \frac{51x + 128}{x}.\]Hence, \[x = \frac{51x + 128}{x}.\]Then $x^2 = 51x + 128$, or $x^2 - 51x - 128 = 0$
Vieta's formula tells us that the sum of the roots of a quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$ is $-\frac{b}{a}$, so in this case, the sum of the roots is $\boxed{51}$.
Note that for the expression to be defined, we must have $x \ge 1.$  Let $y = \sqrt{x - 1}.$  Then $y^2 = x - 1,$ so $x = y^2 + 1.$  We can then write the given equation as
\[\sqrt{y^2 - 4y + 4} + \sqrt{y^2 - 6y + 9} = 1.\]Thus, $\sqrt{(y - 2)^2} + \sqrt{(y - 3)^2} = 1,$ or
\[|y - 2| + |y - 3| = 1.\]If $y < 2,$ then
\[|y - 2| + |y - 3| = 2 - y + 3 - y = 5 - 2y > 1.\]If $y > 3,$ then
\[|y - 2| + |y - 3| = y - 2 + y - 3 = 2y - 5 > 1.\]If $2 \le y \le 3,$ then
\[|y - 2| + |y - 3| = y - 2 + 3 - y = 1,\]so we must have $2 \le y \le 3.$  Then
\[2 \le \sqrt{x - 1} \le 3,\]so
\[4 \le x - 1 \le 9,\]or $5 \le x \le 10.$  Thus, the solution is $x \in \boxed{[5,10]}.$
We can write
\[\frac{x + y}{x} = 1 + \frac{y}{x}.\]Note that $x$ is always negative and $y$ is always positive
Thus, to maximize $\frac{y}{x},$ we should take the smallest value of $x$ and the smallest value of $y,$ which gives us
\[1 + \frac{2}{-4} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.\]
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively
If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$)
The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.
At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004)
\end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\]
Squaring the equation $p + q + r + s = 8,$ we get
\[p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + s^2 + 2(pq + pr + ps + qr + qs + rs) = 64.\]Hence, $p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + s^2 = 64 - 2 \cdot 12 = 40.$
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)(p^2 + q^2 + r^2) \ge (p + q + r)^2.\]Then $3(40 - s^2) \ge (8 - s)^2.$  Expanding, we get $120 - 3s^2 \ge 64 - 16s + s^2,$ so $4s^2 - 16s - 56 \le 0.$  Dividing by 4, we get $s^2 - 4s - 14 \le 0.$  By the quadratic formula, the roots of the corresponding equation $x^2 - 4x - 14 = 0$ are
\[x = 2 \pm 3 \sqrt{2},\]so $s \le 2 + 3 \sqrt{2}.$
Equality occurs when $p = q = r = 2 - \sqrt{2},$ so the maximum value of $s$ is $\boxed{2 + 3 \sqrt{2}}.$
By the AM-HM inequality,
\[\frac{x + y}{2} \ge \frac{2}{\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y}} = \frac{2xy}{x + y},\]so $\frac{x + y}{xy} \ge \frac{4}{x + y}.$  Hence,
\[\frac{x + y}{xyz} \ge \frac{4}{(x + y)z}.\]By the AM-GM inequality,
\[\sqrt{(x + y)z} \le \frac{x + y + z}{2} = \frac{1}{2},\]so $(x + y)z \le \frac{1}{4}.$  Hence,
\[\frac{4}{(x + y)z} \ge 16.\]Equality occurs when $x = y = \frac{1}{4}$ and $z = \frac{1}{2},$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{16}$.
We see that the center of the ellipse is $(-4,2),$ the semi-major axis is 5, and the semi-minor axis is 3, so $h + k + a + b = (-4) + 2 + 5 + 3 = \boxed{6}.$
Let $S = a_ 1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb.$  Then
\begin{align*}
S &= a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + \dotsb \\
&= 1 + 1 + \left( \frac{1}{3} a_2 + \frac{1}{4} a_1 \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} a_3 + \frac{1}{4} a_2 \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} a_4 + \frac{1}{4} a_3 \right) + \dotsb \\
&= 2 + \frac{1}{3} (a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + \dotsb) + \frac{1}{4} (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb) \\
&= 2 + \frac{1}{3} (S - 1) + \frac{1}{4} S.
\end{align*}Solving for $S,$ we find $S = \boxed{4}.$
Let the roots of $(x - \sqrt[3]{13})(x - \sqrt[3]{53})(x - \sqrt[3]{103}) = 0$ be $\alpha,$ $\beta,$ and $\gamma.$  Then by Vieta's formulas,
\begin{align*}
r + s + t &= \alpha + \beta + \gamma, \\
rs + rt + st &= \alpha \beta + \alpha \gamma + \beta \gamma, \\
rst &= \alpha \beta \gamma + \frac{1}{3}.
\end{align*}We have the factorization
\[r^3 + s^3 + t^3 - 3rst = (r + s + t)((r + s + t)^2 - 3(rs + rt + st)).\]Thus, from the equations above,
\[r^3 + s^3 + t^3 - 3rst = \alpha^3 + \beta^3 + \gamma^3 - 3 \alpha \beta \gamma.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
r^3 + s^3 + t^3 &= \alpha^3 + \beta^3 + \gamma^3 + 3(rst - \alpha \beta \gamma) \\
&= 13 + 53 + 103 + 1 \\
&= \boxed{170}.
\end{align*}
By the change-of-base formula, the expression is equivalent to \[\frac{\log (a+1)}{\log a} \cdot \frac{\log (a+2)}{\log (a+1)} \dotsm \frac{\log (b-1)}{\log (b-2)} \cdot \frac{\log b}{\log (b-1)}.\]Almost all the terms cancel, leaving just \[\frac{\log b}{\log a},\]which equals $\log_a b$ by the change-of-base formula again
Therefore, $\log_a b = 2,$ so $b = a^2.$
We are given that the expression contains $870$ logarithms, so $(b-1) - a + 1 = 870,$ or $b-a=870.$ Substituting $b=a^2$ gives $a^2-a=870,$ or $a^2-a-870=0,$ which factors as $(a-30)(a+29)=0.$ Since $a$ must be positive, we have $a=30,$ and so $b=a^2=900.$ Thus, $a+b=30+900=\boxed{930}.$
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2)(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + \dots + x_n^2) \ge (x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n)^2 = 1000^2,\]so $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2 \ge \frac{1000^2}{n}.$
Again by Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2)(x_1^4 + x_2^4 + \dots + \dots + x_n^4) \ge (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2)^2,\]so
\[n \cdot 512000 \ge \frac{1000^4}{n^2}.\]Then
\[n^3 \ge \frac{1000^4}{512000} = \frac{1000^3}{512} = 5^9,\]so $n \ge 125.$
For $n = 125,$ we can take $x_1 = x_2 = \dots = x_{125} = 8,$ so the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{125}.$
Let $x = \sqrt[3]{2} + 1.$  Then $x - 1 = \sqrt[3]{2},$ so
\[(x - 1)^3 = 2.\]This simplifies to $x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 3 = 0.$  Thus, we can take $P(x) = \boxed{x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 3}.$
\[\left| x^2 - x + \frac{1}{2008} \right| = \frac{1}{2008},\]then either $x^2 - x + \frac{1}{2008} = \frac{1}{2008}$ or $x^2 - x + \frac{1}{2008} = -\frac{1}{2008}.$
In the first case, $x^2 - x = x(x - 1) = 0,$ so $x = 0$ or $x = 1,$ and the sum of the squares is $0^2 + 1^2 = 1.$
In the second case,
\[x^2 - x + \frac{1}{1004} = 0.\]Let the roots be $a$ and $b.$  Then by Vieta's formulas, $a + b = 1$ and $ab = \frac{1}{1004},$ so
\[a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab = 1 - \frac{1}{502} = \frac{501}{502}.\]Therefore, the sum of the squares of the solutions is $1 + \frac{501}{502} = \boxed{\frac{1003}{502}}.$
Since $P(0) = 0,$ $e = 0.$  Let the other $x$-intercepts be $p,$ $q,$ $r,$ and $s,$ so
\[P(x) = x(x - p)(x - q)(x - r)(x - s).\]Note that $d = pqrs.$  Since the $x$-intercepts are all distinct, $p,$ $q,$ $r,$ and $s$ are all nonzero, so $d$ must be nonzero
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(D)}}.$
Any of the other coefficients can be zero
For example, consider
\[x(x + 2)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x - 2) = x^5 - 5x^3 + 4x\]or
\[x(x + 2)(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 4) = x^5 - 5x^4 + 20x^2 - 16x.\]
Note that \[
\left|\frac{a+b}{a-b}\right| = \sqrt{\frac{(a+b)^2}{(a-b)^2}}
= \sqrt{\frac{a^2+b^2+2ab}{a^2+b^2-2ab}} = \sqrt{\frac{10ab}{6ab}} =
\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{15}}{3}}.
Let $r$ be the radius of the circle
Then we can assume that the graph of one of the parabolas is $y = x^2 + r.$
Since $\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3},$ the parabola $y = x^2 + r$ will be tangent to the line $y = x \sqrt{3}.$
unitsize(1 cm);
real func (real x) {
return (x^2 + 3/4);
path parab = graph(func,-1.5,1.5);
draw(dir(240)--3*dir(60),red);
draw(parab);
draw(Circle((0,0),3/4));
draw((-2,0)--(2,0));
label("$60^\circ$", 0.5*dir(30));
dot((0,0),red);
[/asy]
This means the equation $x^2 + r = x \sqrt{3},$ or $x^2 - x \sqrt{3} + r = 0$ will have exactly one solution
Hence, the discriminant will be 0, so $3 - 4r = 0,$ or $r = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.$
We have that
\[x - 2 = \frac{b + c}{a}, \quad y - 2 = \frac{a + c}{b}, \quad z - 2 = \frac{a + b}{c},\]so
\[x - 1 = \frac{a + b + c}{a}, \quad y - 1 = \frac{a + b + c}{b}, \quad z - 1 = \frac{a + b + c}{c}.\]Then
\[\frac{1}{x - 1} = \frac{a}{a + b + c}, \quad \frac{1}{y - 1} = \frac{b}{a + b + c}, \quad \frac{1}{z - 1} = \frac{c}{a + b + c},\]so
\[\frac{1}{x - 1} + \frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{1}{z - 1} = \frac{a + b + c}{a + b + c} = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(x - 1)(y - 1)(z - 1),$ we get
\[(y - 1)(z - 1) + (x - 1)(z - 1) + (x - 1)(y - 1) = (x - 1)(y - 1)(z - 1).\]Expanding, we get
\[xy + xz + yz - 2(x + y + z) + 3 = xyz - (xy + xz + yz) + (x + y + z) - 1,\]so
\[xyz = 2(xy + xz + yz) - 3(x + y + z) + 4 = 2 \cdot 5 - 3 \cdot 3 + 4 = \boxed{5}.\]
We have \[
\left\lfloor \frac{2007! + 2004!}{2006! + 2005!}\right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{\left(2007 \cdot 2006 + \frac{1}{2005}\right)\cdot 2005!}{(2006+1)\cdot 2005!}\right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2007\cdot 2006 + \frac{1}{2005}}{2007}\right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2006 + \frac{1}{2005 \cdot 2007}\right\rfloor = \boxed{2006}.
We start with small cases
For $n = 1,$ the equation becomes
\[a + bi = a - bi,\]so $2bi = 0,$ which means $b = 0.$  This is not possible, because $b$ is positive.
For $n = 2,$ the equation becomes
\[a^2 + 2abi - b^2 = a^2 - 2abi - b^2 = 0,\]so $4abi = 0,$ which means $ab = 0.$  Again, this is not possible, because both $a$ and $b$ are positive.
For $n = 3,$ the equation becomes
\[a^3 + 3a^2 bi + 3ab^2 i^2 + b^3 i^3 = a^3 - 3a^2 bi + 3ab^2 i^2 - b^3 i^3,\]so $6a^2 bi + 2b^3 i^3 = 0,$ or $6a^2 bi - 2b^3 i = 0.$  Then
\[2bi (3a^2 - b^2) = 0.\]Since $b$ is positive, $3a^2 = b^2.$  Then $a \sqrt{3} = b,$ so $\frac{b}{a} = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}.$
Computing the sums of the entries in the first few rows suggestions that the sum of the entries in row $n$ is $2^n$
Indeed, one way to prove this formula is to note that the $k$th entry of the $n$th row is $\binom{n}{k}$ (if we say that the entries in the $n$th row are numbered $k=0,1,\dots,n$)
We have  \[
\binom{n}{0}+\binom{n}{1}+\binom{n}{2}+\dots +\binom{n}{n} = 2^n,
\]since both sides calculate the number of ways to choose some subset of $n$ objects
It follows that $f(n)=\log_{10} (2^n)$, which means that $\frac{f(n)}{\log_{10} 2}=\frac{\log_{10} (2^n)}{\log_{10} 2}$
Applying the change of base formula gives us $\log_2 (2^n)=\boxed{n}$.
Since there are vertical asymptotes at $x = -3$ and $x = 2,$ we can assume that $q(x) = (x + 3)(x - 2).$
Since the graph passes through $(0,0),$ $p(x) = kx$ for some constant $k.$  Thus,
\[\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \frac{kx}{(x + 3)(x - 2)}.\]To find $k,$ note that the graph passes through $(3,1).$  Thus,
\[\frac{3k}{(6)(1)} = 1.\]Hence, $k = 2,$ and
\[\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \frac{2x}{(x + 3)(x - 2)}.\]Then
\[\frac{p(-1)}{q(-1)} = \frac{2(-1)}{(2)(-3)} = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}.\]
We have $q(x) = (x^2+2)^2$
We wish to determine the set of all $y$ for which $q(x)=y$ has solutions
We must have $y\ge 0$, since $q(x)$ is a square and squares are nonnegative
Under the assumption $y\ge 0$, we have:
$$\begin{array}{r r@{~=~}l}
& y & (x^2+2)^2 \\
\Leftrightarrow & \sqrt y & x^2+2 \\
\Leftrightarrow & \sqrt y-2 & x^2 \\
\end{array}$$We see that $\sqrt y-2\ge 0$ because squares are nonnegative
Thus, we need $y\ge 4$
When $y\ge 4$, we have $y=q(x)$ by setting $x$ equal to either of $\pm \sqrt{\sqrt y-2}$, and so any $y\ge 4$ can be achieved.
Therefore, the range of $q(x)$ is $\boxed{[4,\infty)}$.
Because $b<10^b$ for all $b>0$, it follows that $\log_{10}b<b$
If $b\geq 1$, then $0<\left(\log_{10}b\right)/b^2<1$, so $a$ cannot be an integer
Therefore $0<b<1$, so $\log_{10}b<0$ and $a =
\left(\log_{10}b\right)/b^2<0$
Thus $a<0<b<1<1/b$, and the median of the set is $\boxed{b}$.
Note that the conditions of the problem can be met with $b = 0.1$ and $a = -100$.
For the given function to have a horizontal asymptote, the function will need to approach a constant as $x \to \pm \infty$
This is only possible if the denominator $q(x)$ is at least the same degree as the numerator
Since the numerator has degree $6$, the smallest possible degree of $q(x)$ that will allow the function to have a horizontal asymptote is $\boxed{6}$
For example, we can take $q(x) = x^6.$
Let $q(x) = p(x) - x^3,$ and let $r_1,$ $r_2,$ $\dots,$ $r_n$ be the integer roots to $p(k) = k^3.$  Then
\[q(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2) \dotsm (x - r_n) q_0(x)\]for some polynomial $q_0(x)$ with integer coefficients.
Setting $x = 100,$ we get
\[q(100) = (100 - r_1)(100 - r_2) \dotsm (100 - r_n) q_0(100).\]Since $p(100) = 100,$
\[q(100) = 100 - 100^3 = -999900 = -2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 11 \cdot 101.\]We can then write $-999900$ as a product of at most 10 different integer factors:
\[-999900 = (1)(-1)(2)(-2)(3)(-3)(5)(-5)(-11)(101).\]Thus, the number of integer solutions $n$ is at most 10.
Accordingly, we can take
\[q(x) = (x - 99)(x - 101)(x - 98)(x - 102)(x - 97)(x - 103)(x - 95)(x - 105)(x - 111)(x - 1),\]and $p(x) = q(x) + x^3,$ so $p(k) = k^3$ has 10 integer roots, namely 99, 101, 98, 102, 97, 103, 95, 105, 111, and 1
Thus, $\boxed{10}$ integer roots is the maximum.
Squaring both sides, we get
\[9 \sqrt[3]{5} - 9 \sqrt[3]{4} = \sqrt[3]{a^2} + \sqrt[3]{b^2} + \sqrt[3]{c^2} + 2 \sqrt[3]{ab} - 2 \sqrt[3]{ac} - 2 \sqrt[3]{bc}.\]To make the right side look like the left-side, some terms will probably have to cancel.
Suppose $\sqrt[3]{a^2} = 2 \sqrt[3]{bc}.$  Then $a^2 = 8bc,$ so $c = \frac{a^2}{8b}.$  Substituting, the right-hand side becomes
\begin{align*}
\sqrt[3]{b^2} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{a^4}{64b^2}} + 2 \sqrt[3]{ab} - 2 \sqrt[3]{a \cdot \frac{a^2}{8b}} &= \sqrt[3]{b^2} + \frac{a}{4b} \sqrt[3]{ab} + 2 \sqrt[3]{ab} - \frac{a}{b} \sqrt[3]{b^2} \\
&= \left( 1 - \frac{a}{b} \right) \sqrt[3]{b^2} + \left( \frac{a}{4b} + 2 \right) \sqrt[3]{ab}.
\end{align*}At this point, we could try to be systematic, but it's easier to test some small values
For example, we could try taking $b = 2,$ to capture the $\sqrt[3]{4}$ term
This gives us
\[\left( 1 - \frac{a}{2} \right) \sqrt[3]{4} + \left( \frac{a}{8} + 2 \right) \sqrt[3]{2a}.\]Then taking $a = 20$ gives us exactly what we want:
\[\left( 1 - \frac{20}{2} \right) \sqrt[3]{4} + \left( \frac{20}{8} + 2 \right) \sqrt[3]{40} = 9 \sqrt[3]{5} - 9 \sqrt[3]{4}.\]Then $c = \frac{a^2}{8b} = 25.$  Thus, $a + b + c = 20 + 2 + 25 = \boxed{47}.$
The expression $x_2(x_1+x_3)$ is not symmetric in the roots $x_1, x_2, x_3,$ so Vieta's formulas can't be used directly to find its value
We hope that we can determine some of the values of the roots explicitly
Letting $a = \sqrt{2014},$ the equation becomes \[ax^3 - (2a^2+1)x^2 + 2 = 0.\]We can rearrange this as \[(ax^3-x^2) - (2a^2x^2-2) = 0,\]or \[x^2(ax-1) - 2(ax-1)(ax+1) = 0.\]Therefore, we have \[(ax-1)(x^2-2ax-2) = 0.\]It follows that one of the roots of the equation is $x = \tfrac{1}{a},$ and the other two roots satisfy the quadratic $x^2 - 2ax - 2 = 0.$ By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of the quadratic is $-2,$ which is negative, so one of the roots must be negative and the other must be positive
Furthermore, the sum of the roots is $2a,$ so the positive root must be greater than $2a.$ Since $2a > \tfrac1a,$ it follows that $\tfrac{1}{a}$ is the middle root of the equation
That is, $x_2 = \tfrac1a.$
Then $x_1$ and $x_3$ are the roots of $x^2-2ax-2=0,$ so by Vieta, $x_1+x_3=2a.$ Thus, \[x_2(x_1+x_3) = \frac1a \cdot 2a = \boxed{2}.\]
Completing the square in $y,$ we get
\[(y + 3)^2 + 2x - 4 = 0.\]Then solving for $x,$ we get
\[x = 2 - \frac{1}{2} (y + 3)^2.\]Thus, the vertex of the parabola is $\boxed{(2,-3)}.$
Since our divisor $(x^2-4)(x+1)$ has degree $3$, our remainder must have degree at most $2$
In other words, our remainder is of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ for some constants $a$, $b$, and $c$
Let the quotient of the division be $q(x)$
$$x^5-x^4-x^3+x^2+x =(x^2-4)(x+1)q(x) + ax^2+bx+c $$We can see that our divisor $(x^2-4)(x+1)$ has roots $x=2$, $x= -2,$ and $x= -1$
Plugging in these roots gives us equations:
For $x=2$ we have $32-16-8+4+2 = 0+4a+2b+c$ which gives us
$$4a + 2b+c = 14.$$For $x=-2$ we have $-32-16+8+4-2 = 0+4a-2b+c$ which gives us
$$4a - 2b+c = -38.$$For $x=-1$ we have $-1-1+1+1-1 = 0+a-b+c$ which gives us
$$a - b+c = 1.$$Solving these three equations gives us $a=-8$, $b=13,$ and $c=20$.
So our remainder is $\boxed{-8x^2+13x+20}$.
Place the ellipse in the coordinate plane, as usual, so that the center is at the origin
Then the equation of the ellipse is
\[\frac{x^2}{25} + \frac{y^2}{16} = 1.\]Also, the distance from the center to each foci is $\sqrt{5^2 - 4^2} = 3,$ so one foci is at $F = (3,0).$

Consider the circle centered at $F$ with radius 2
The equation of this circle is $(x - 3)^2 + y^2 = 4,$ so $y^2 = 4 - (x - 3)^2.$  Substituting into the equation of the ellipse, we get
\[\frac{x^2}{25} + \frac{4 - (x - 3)^2}{16} = 1.\]This simplifies to $3x^2 - 50x + 175 = 0,$ which factors as $(x - 5)(3x - 35) = 0.$  The solutions are $x = 5$ and $x = \frac{35}{3},$ the latter root being extraneous
This tells us that the ellipse and circle intersect only at the point $(5,0),$ and clearly we cannot draw a larger circle.
Hence, the maximum radius is $\boxed{2}.$
Subtracting the equations $y + xz = 10$ and $z + xy = 10,$ we get
\[y + xz - z - xy = 0.\]Then $y - z + x(z - y) = 0,$ so $(y - z)(1 - x) = 0.$  Hence, $y = z$ or $x = 1.$
If $x = 1,$ then $yz = 6$ and $y + z = 10.$  Then by Vieta's formulas, $y$ and $z$ are the roots of $t^2 - 10t + 6 = 0.$  Thus, $x = 1$ for two ordered triples $(x,y,z).$
If $y = z,$ then
\begin{align*}
x + y^2 &= 7, \\
y + xy &= 10.
\end{align*}Squaring the second equation, we get $(x + 1)^2 y^2 = 100.$  Then $(x + 1)^2 (7 - x) = 100,$ which simplifies to $x^3 - 5x^2 - 13x + 93 = 0.$  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is 5, so the sum of all the $x_i$ is $2 + 5 = \boxed{7}.$
Let $z = x + yi.$  Then $\frac{z}{40} = \frac{x}{40} + \frac{y}{40} \cdot i,$ so
\[0 \le \frac{x}{40} \le 1\]and
\[0 \le \frac{y}{40} \le 1.\]In other words $0 \le x \le 40$ and $0 \le y \le 40.$
\[\frac{40}{\overline{z}} = \frac{40}{x - yi} = \frac{40 (x + yi)}{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{40x}{x^2 + y^2} + \frac{40y}{x^2 + y^2} \cdot i,\]so
\[0 \le \frac{40x}{x^2 + y^2} \le 1\]and
\[0 \le \frac{40y}{x^2 + y^2} \le 1.\]Since $x \ge 0,$ the first inequality is equivalent to $40x \le x^2 + y^2.$  Completing the square, we get
\[(x - 20)^2 + y^2 \ge 20^2.\]Since $y \ge 0,$ the second inequality is equivalent to $40y \le x^2 + y^2.$  Completing the square, we get
\[x^2 + (y - 20)^2 \ge 20^2.\]Thus, $A$ is the region inside the square with vertices $0,$ $40,$ $40 + 40i,$ and $40i,$ but outside the circle centered at $20$ with radius $20,$ and outside the circle centered at $20i$ with radius $20.$

To find the area of $A,$ we divide the square into four quadrants
The shaded area in the upper-left quadrant is
\[20^2 - \frac{1}{4} \cdot \pi \cdot 20^2 = 400 - 100 \pi.\]The shaded area in the lower-right quadrant is also $400 - 100 \pi.$  Thus, the area of $A$ is
\[2(400 - 100 \pi) + 400 = \boxed{1200 - 200 \pi}.\]
By the given,
\[2004(x^3-3xy^2)-2005(y^3-3x^2y)=0.\]Dividing both sides by $y^3$ and setting $t=\frac{x}{y}$ yields
\[2004(t^3-3t)-2005(1-3t^2)=0.\]A quick check shows that this cubic has three real roots
Since the three roots are precisely $\frac{x_1}{y_1}$, $\frac{x_2}{y_2}$, and $\frac{x_3}{y_3}$, we must have
\[2004(t^3-3t)-2005(1-3t^2)=2004\left(t-\frac{x_1}{y_1}\right)\left(t-\frac{x_2}{y_2}\right)\left(t-\frac{x_3}{y_3}\right).\]Therefore, $$\left(1-\frac{x_1}{y_1}\right)\left(1-\frac{x_2}{y_2}\right)\left(1-\frac{x_3}{y_3}\right)=\frac{2004(1^3-3(1))-2005(1-3(1)^2)}{2004}=\boxed{\frac{1}{1002}}.$$
Let $x = a,$ $y = b - a,$ and $z = c - b,$ so $x \ge 1,$ $y \ge 1,$ and $z \ge 1.$  Also, $b = a + y = x + y$ and $c = b + z = x + y + z,$ so
\begin{align*}
\sum_{1 \le a < b < c} \frac{1}{2^a 3^b 5^c} &= \sum_{x = 1}^\infty \sum_{y = 1}^\infty \sum_{z = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^x 3^{x + y} 5^{x + y + z}} \\
&= \sum_{x = 1}^\infty \sum_{y = 1}^\infty \sum_{z = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{30^x 15^y 5^z} \\
&= \sum_{x = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{30^x} \sum_{y = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{15^y} \sum_{z = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{5^z} \\
&= \frac{1}{29} \cdot \frac{1}{14} \cdot \frac{1}{4} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{1}{1624}}.
\end{align*}
Letting $a_1 = x$ and $a_2 = y,$ we have \[\begin{aligned} a_3 &= y-x, \\ a_4 &= (y-x) - y = -x, \\ a_5 &= -x-(y-x) = -y, \\ a_6 &= -y-(-x) = x-y, \\ a_7 &= (x-y)-(-y) = x, \\ a_8 &= x-(x-y) = y
\end{aligned}\]Since $a_7 = a_1$ and $a_8 = a_2,$ the sequence repeats with period $6$; that is, $a_{k+6} = a_k$ for all positive integers $k.$
Furthermore, the sum of any six consecutive terms in the sequence equals \[x + y + (y-x) + (-x) + (-y) + (x-y) = 0.\]So, since $1492$ is $4$ more than a multiple of six, the sum of the first $1492$ terms is equal to the sum of the first four terms: \[\begin{aligned} 1985 &= a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{1492} \\&= a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4\\&=x+y+(y-x)+(-x)\\&=2y-x
\end{aligned}\]Similarly, since $1985$ is $5$ more than a multiple of six, we have \[\begin{aligned}1492 &= a_1+a_2+\dots+a_{1985}\\&=a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5\\&=x+y+(y-x)+(-x)+(-y)\\&=y-x
\end{aligned}\]Subtracting this second equation from the first equation, we get $y = 1985 - 1492 = 493.$
Since $2001$ is $3$ more than a multiple of six, we have \[\begin{aligned}a_1+a_2+\dots+a_{2001} &= a_1+a_2+a_3\\&=x+y+(y-x)\\&=2y = 2\cdot 493 = \boxed{986}.\end{aligned}\](Note that solving for $x$ was not strictly necessary.)
We look for a factorization of $x^4 - 4x - 1$ of the form $(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d).$  Thus,
\[x^4 + (a + c) x^3 + (ac + b + d) x^2 + (ad + bc) x + bd = x^4 - 4x - 1.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
a + c &= 0, \\
ac + b + d &= 0, \\
ad + bc &= -4, \\
bd &= -1.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $c = -a.$  Substituting, we get
\begin{align*}
-a^2 + b+ d &= 0, \\
ad - ab &= -4, \\
bd &= -1.
\end{align*}Then $b + d = a^2$ and $b - d = \frac{4}{a},$ so $b = \frac{a^3 + 4}{2a}$ and $d = \frac{a^3 - 4}{2a}.$  Hence,
\[\frac{(a^3 + 4)(a^3 - 4)}{4a^2} = -1.\]This simplifies to $a^6 + 4a^2 - 16 = 0.$  This factors as
\[(a^2 - 2)(a^4 + 2a^2 + 8) = 0,\]so we can take $a = \sqrt{2}.$  Then $b = 1 + \sqrt{2},$ $c = -\sqrt{2},$ and $d = 1 - \sqrt{2},$ so
\[x^4 - 4x - 1 = (x^2 + x \sqrt{2} + 1 + \sqrt{2})(x^2 - x \sqrt{2} + 1 - \sqrt{2}).\]Checking the discriminants, we find that only the second quadratic factor has real roots, so the sum of the real roots is $\boxed{\sqrt{2}}.$
We can obtain the graph of $y = g(x)$ by taking the graph of $y = f(x)$ and stretching it horizontally by a factor of 2, then shifting it down by 4 units
Therefore, $g(x) = f \left( \frac{x}{2} \right) - 4.$  This means $(a,b,c) = \boxed{\left( 1, \frac{1}{2}, -4 \right)}.$
More generally, for $c > 1,$ the graph of $y = f \left( \frac{x}{c} \right)$ is obtained by stretching the graph of $y = f(x)$ horizontally by factor of $c.$
We have $|2-4i| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}$
Similarly, we have $|2+4i| = \sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = 2\sqrt{5}$, so $|2-4i| + |2+4i| = \boxed{4\sqrt{5}}$.
Since $q(x)$ is a quadratic, and we have a horizontal asymptote at $y=0,$ we know that $p(x)$ must be linear.
Since we have a hole at $x=1,$ there must be a factor of $x-1$ in both $p(x)$ and $q(x).$ Additionally, since there is a vertical asymptote at $x=-1,$ the denominator $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x+1.$ Then, $p(x) = a(x-1)$ and $q(x) = b(x+1)(x-1),$ for some constants $a$ and $b.$
Since $p(2) = 1$, we have $a(2-1) = 1$ and hence $a=1$
Since $q(2) = 3$, we have $b(2+1)(2-1) = 3$ and hence $b=1$.
So $p(x) = x - 1$ and $q(x) = (x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1,$ so $p(x) + q(x) = \boxed{x^2 + x - 2}.$
We try graphing both equations in the $xy-$plane
The graph of $x+3y=3$ is a line passing through $(3,0)$ and $(0,1).$ To graph $\left| |x|- |y| \right| = 1,$ notice that the equation does not change if we replace $x$ by $-x$ or if we replace $y$ by $-y.$ Thus, the graph of $\left| |x|- |y| \right| = 1$ is symmetric about the $y-$axis and the $x-$axis, so if we graph the equation in just the first quadrant, we can produce the remainder of the graph by reflecting it over the axes.
If $(x, y)$ lies in the first quadrant, then $x \ge 0$ and $y \ge 0,$ so the equation $\left| |x|- |y| \right| = 1$ becomes just $|x-y| = 1.$ Therefore, either $x-y = 1$ or $y-x = 1,$ whose graphs in the first quadrant are rays
This gives us the whole graph of $\left| |x|- |y| \right| = 1:$

(The graph of $\left||x|-|y|\right|=1$ is drawn in blue, and the line $x+3y=3$ is drawn in red.) We see that the two graphs intersect at $\boxed{3}$ points.
Let $m = \lfloor x \rfloor.$
If $m \le x < m + \frac{1}{3},$ then
\[\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor 2x \rfloor + \lfloor 3x \rfloor = m + 2m + 3m = 6m.\]If $m + \frac{1}{3} \le x < m + \frac{1}{2},$ then
\[\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor 2x \rfloor + \lfloor 3x \rfloor = m + 2m + 3m + 1 = 6m + 1.\]If $m + \frac{1}{2} \le x < m + \frac{2}{3},$ then
\[\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor 2x \rfloor + \lfloor 3x \rfloor = m + 2m + 1 + 3m + 1 = 6m + 2.\]If $m + \frac{2}{3} \le x < m + 1,$ then
\[\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor 2x \rfloor + \lfloor 3x \rfloor = m + 2m + 1 + 3m + 2 = 6m + 3.\]Thus, an integer can be expressed in the from $\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor 2x \rfloor + \lfloor 3x \rfloor$ if and only if it is of the form $6m,$ $6m + 1,$ $6m + 2,$ or $6m + 3.$  It is easy to count that in the range $1 \le n \le 1000,$ the number of numbers of these forms is 166, 167, 167, 167, respectively, so the total is $166 + 167 + 167 + 167 = \boxed{667}.$
Let $f(x) = x^2+2ax+3a.$ Then we want the graph of $y=f(x)$ to intersect the "strip" $-2 \le y \le 2$ in exactly one point
Because the graph of $y=f(x)$ is a parabola opening upwards, this is possible if and only if the minimum value of $f(x)$ is $2.$
To find the minimum value of $f(x),$ complete the square: \[f(x) = (x^2+2ax+a^2) + (3a-a^2) = (x+a)^2 + (3a-a^2).\]It follows that the minimum value of $f(x)$ is $3a-a^2,$ so we have \[3a - a^2 = 2,\]which has solutions $a = \boxed{1, 2}.$
Let $y = \sqrt{x - 8},$ so
\[\frac{6}{y - 9} + \frac{1}{y - 4} + \frac{7}{y + 4} + \frac{12}{y + 9} = 0.\]Note that
\[\frac{6}{y - 9} + \frac{12}{y + 9} = \frac{6(y + 9) + 12(y - 9)}{y^2 - 81} = \frac{18y - 54}{y^2 - 81} = \frac{18(y - 3)}{y^2 - 81},\]and
\[\frac{1}{y - 4} + \frac{7}{y + 4} = \frac{y + 4 + 7(y - 4)}{y^2 - 16} = \frac{8y - 24}{y^2 - 16} = \frac{8(y - 3)}{y^2 - 16},\]so
\[\frac{18(y - 3)}{y^2 - 81} + \frac{8(y - 3)}{y^2 - 16} = 0.\]If $y = 3,$ then $x = 3^2 + 8 = 17.$  Otherwise, we can divide both sides by $2(y - 3),$ to get
\[\frac{9}{y^2 - 81} + \frac{4}{y^2 - 16} = 0.\]Multiplying both sides by $(y^2 - 16)(y^2 - 81),$ we get
\[9(y^2 - 16) + 4(y^2 - 81) = 0.\]Then $13y^2 = 468,$ so $y^2 = 36.$  Since $y = \sqrt{x - 8}$ must be nonnegative, $y = 6.$  Then $x = 6^2 + 8 = 44.$
Therefore, the solutions are $\boxed{17,44}.$
Since $z^2 = 24-32i$, we must have $|z^2| = |24-32i| = |8(3-4i)| = 8|3-4i| = 8(5) = 40$
We also have $|z|^2 = |z|\cdot |z| = |(z)(z)| = |z^2|$, so $|z^2| = 40$ means that $|z|^2 = 40$, which gives us $|z| = \sqrt{40} = \boxed{2\sqrt{10}}$.
Expanding, we get
\[b^2 + x^2 = a^2 - 2ax + x^2 + b^2 - 2by + y^2.\]Hence,
\[a^2 + y^2 = 2ax + 2by.\]Note that
\[2by > 2y^2 \ge y^2,\]so $2by - y^2 \ge 0.$  Since $2by - y^2 = a^2 - 2ax,$ $a^2 - 2ax \ge 0,$ or
\[a^2 \ge 2ax.\]Since $a > 0,$ $a \ge 2x,$ so
\[x \le \frac{a}{2}.\]Now,
\[a^2 \le a^2 + y^2 = b^2 + x^2 \le b^2 + \frac{a^2}{4},\]so
\[\frac{3}{4} a^2 \le b^2.\]Hence,
\[\left( \frac{a}{b} \right)^2 \le \frac{4}{3}.\]Equality occurs when $a = 1,$ $b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},$ $x = \frac{1}{2},$ and $y = 0,$ so $\rho^2 = \boxed{\frac{4}{3}}.$

We try to rewrite the given equation in one of the standard forms of a conic section
Because both sides are nonnegative, we may square both sides, knowing that this operation is reversible: \[(y+5)^2 = (x-2)^2 + y^2.\]Then \[(y+5)^2 - y^2 = (x-2)^2,\]or \[10y + 25 = x^2 - 4x + 4.\]Because there is an $x^2$ term but no $y^2$ term, we recognize that this equation describes a $\boxed{\text{(P)}}$ parabola.
If $r$ and $s$ are the integer zeros, the polynomial can be written in the form $$P(x)=(x-r)(x-s)(x^2+\alpha x + \beta).$$The coefficient of $x^3$, $\alpha-(r+s)$, is an integer, so $\alpha$ is an integer
The coefficient of $x^2$, $\beta - \alpha(r+s)+rs$, is an integer, so $\beta$ is also an integer
Applying the quadratic formula gives the remaining zeros as $$\frac{1}{2}(-\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2-4\beta}) = -\frac{\alpha}{2} \pm i\frac{\sqrt{4\beta-\alpha^2}}{2}.$$Answer choices (A), (B), (C), and (E) require that $\alpha=-1$, which implies that the imaginary parts of the remaining zeros have the form $\pm\sqrt{4\beta-1}/2$
This is true only for choice $\boxed{\text{(A)}}$.
Note that choice (D) is not possible since this choice requires $\alpha = -2$, which produces an imaginary part of the form $\sqrt{\beta-1}$, which cannot be $\frac{1}{2}$.
By the Binomial Theorem, the third, fourth, and fifth terms in the expansion of $(x + a)^n$ are $\binom{n}{2} x^{n - 2} a^2,$ $\binom{n}{3} x^{n - 3} a^3,$ and $\binom{n}{4} x^{n - 4} a^4,$ respectively
\[\frac{\binom{n}{2} x^{n - 2} a^2}{\binom{n}{3} x^{n - 3} a^3} = \frac{84}{280}.\]This simplifies to
\[\frac{3x}{a(n - 2)} = \frac{3}{10},\]so $10x = a(n - 2).$
\[\frac{\binom{n}{3} x^{n - 3} a^3}{\binom{n}{4} x^{n - 4} a^4} = \frac{280}{560}.\]This simplifies to
\[\frac{4x}{a(n - 3)} = \frac{1}{2},\]so $8x = a(n - 3).$
Dividing the equations $10x = a(n - 2)$ and $8x = a(n - 3),$ we get
\[\frac{n - 3}{n - 2} = \frac{4}{5}.\]Then $5n - 15 = 4n - 8,$ so $n = \boxed{7}.$
Let $n$ be a positive integer
\[\frac{(n + 1)^2}{1000} - \frac{n^2}{1000} = \frac{2n + 1}{1000}.\]Thus, the inequality $\frac{(n + 1)^2}{1000} - \frac{n^2}{1000} < 1$ is equivalent to
\[\frac{2n + 1}{1000} < 1,\]or $n < 499 + \frac{1}{2}.$
Hence, for $n \le 499,$ the difference between $\frac{n^2}{1000}$ and $\frac{(n + 1)^2}{1000}$ is less than 1, which means the list
\[\left\lfloor \frac{1^2}{1000} \right\rfloor, \ \left\lfloor \frac{2^2}{1000} \right\rfloor, \ \left\lfloor \frac{3^2}{1000} \right\rfloor, \ \dots, \ \left\lfloor \frac{500^2}{1000} \right\rfloor\]includes all the numbers from 0 to $\left\lfloor \frac{500^2}{1000} \right\rfloor = 250.$
From this point, the difference between $\frac{n^2}{1000}$ and $\frac{(n + 1)^2}{1000}$ is greater than 1, so all the numbers in the list
\[\left\lfloor \frac{501^2}{1000} \right\rfloor, \ \left\lfloor \frac{502^2}{1000} \right\rfloor, \ \left\lfloor \frac{503^2}{1000} \right\rfloor, \ \dots, \ \left\lfloor \frac{1000^2}{1000} \right\rfloor\]are different
Therefore, there are a total of $251 + 500 = \boxed{751}$ distinct numbers.
We can let the factorization be
\[x^2 + bx + 2008 = (x + p)(x + q),\]where $p$ and $q$ are integers
Then $p + q = b$ and $pq = 2008.$
The equation $pq = 2008$ tells us that either both $p$ and $q$ are positive, or both are negative
Since $p + q = b$ is positive, both $p$ and $q$ are positive.
We want to find the minimum value of $b.$  The number $b = p + q$ is minimized when $p$ and $q$ are as close as possible, under the condition $pq = 2008.$  This occurs when $p$ and $q$ are 8 and 251, so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $8 + 251 = \boxed{259}.$
Since $2x - 4 = 2(x - 2),$ by the Remainder Theorem, we can find the remainder by setting $x = 2.$  Thus, the remainder is
\[3 \cdot 2^7 - 2^6 - 7 \cdot 2^5 + 2 \cdot 2^3 + 4 \cdot 2^2 - 11 = \boxed{117}.\]
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(1 + 4 + 9)(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2) \ge (x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3)^2 = 60^2,\]so $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 \ge \frac{3600}{14} = \frac{1800}{7}.$
Equality occurs when $x_1 = \frac{x_2}{2} = \frac{x_3}{3}$ and $x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 60.$  We can solve, to find $x_1 = \frac{30}{7},$ $x_2 = \frac{60}{7},$ and $x_3 = \frac{90}{7}.$  Hence, the smallest possible value is $\boxed{\frac{1800}{7}}.$
Squaring the equation $x + y + z = 5,$ we get
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + xz + yz) = 25.\]Then $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25 - 2 \cdot 8 = 9.$
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(1^2 + 1^2)(y^2 + z^2) \ge (y + z)^2.\]Then $2(9 - x^2) \ge (5 - x)^2,$ which expands as $18 - 2x^2 \ge 25 - 10x + x^2.$  This simplifies to $3x^2 - 10x + 7 \le 0,$ which factors as $(x - 1)(3x - 7) \le 0.$  Hence, $x \le \frac{7}{3}.$
Equality occurs when $y = z = \frac{4}{3},$ so the maximum value of $x$ is $\boxed{\frac{7}{3}}.$
We iterate through the definition of $A(m, n).$ Each step below is marked either $(1),$ $(2),$ or $(3),$ corresponding to the three parts of the definition of $A(m, n)$: \[\begin{aligned} A(2, 1)&\stackrel{(3)}{=}  A(1, A(2, 0)) \\ &\stackrel{(2)}{=} A(1, A(1, 1)) \\ &\stackrel{(3)}{=}  A(1, A(0, A(1, 0))) \\ &\stackrel{(2)}{=}  A(1, A(0, A(0, 1))) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} A(1, A(0, 2)) \\  &\stackrel{(1)}{=} A(1, 3) \\ &\stackrel{(3)}{=}  A(0, A(1, 2)) \\ &\stackrel{(3)}{=} A(0, A(0, A(1, 1)))
\end{aligned}\]In the last few steps, we actually computed $A(1, 1) = 3,$ so we have \[A(2, 1) = A(0, A(0, 3)) = A(0, 4) = \boxed{5}\]by applying $(1)$ twice.
(Note: the function $A(m, n)$ is called the Ackermann function
Because of its deeply recursive definition, $A(m, n)$ grows extremely quickly
For example, other values of $A(m, n)$ include $A(3, 3) = 29$ and $A(4, 2) = 2^{65536} - 3,$ which has tens of thousands of digits in base ten!)
Let $y = mx + c$ be a line passing through $(0,c).$  Setting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[x^2 = mx + c,\]or $x^2 - mx - c = 0.$  Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation
By Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = m$ and $x_1 x_2 = -c.$
Also, $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1,mx_1 + c)$ and $(x_2,mx_2 + c)$ in some order, so
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{AC^2} + \frac{1}{BC^2} &= \frac{1}{x_1^2 + m^2 x_1^2} + \frac{1}{x_2^2 + m^2 x_2^2} \\
&= \frac{1}{m^2 + 1} \left (\frac{1}{x_1^2} + \frac{1}{x_2^2} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{m^2 + 1} \cdot \frac{x_1^2 + x_2^2}{x_1^2 x_2^2} \\
&= \frac{1}{m^2 + 1} \cdot \frac{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1 x_2}{(x_1 x_2)^2} \\
&= \frac{1}{m^2 + 1} \cdot \frac{m^2 + 2c}{c^2}.
\end{align*}For this expression to be independent of $m,$ we must have $c = \frac{1}{2}.$  Hence, the constant $t$ is $\boxed{4}.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= x + \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} + \frac{x(x + 4)}{x^2 + 2} + \frac{2(x + 2)}{x(x^2 + 2)} \\
&= \frac{x(x^2 + 1) + x}{x^2 + 1} + \frac{x^2 (x + 4)}{x(x^2 + 2)} + \frac{2(x + 2)}{x(x^2 + 2)} \\
&= \frac{x^3 + 2x}{x^2 + 1} + \frac{x^3 + 4x^2 + 2x + 4}{x(x^2 + 2)} \\
&= \frac{x(x^2 + 2)}{x^2 + 1} + \frac{4x^2 + 4}{x(x^2 + 2)} + \frac{x(x^2 + 2)}{x(x^2 + 2)} \\
&= \frac{x(x^2 + 2)}{x^2 + 1} + 4 \cdot \frac{x^2 + 1}{x(x^2 + 2)} + 1.
\end{align*}By AM-GM,
\[\frac{x(x^2 + 2)}{x^2 + 1} + 4 \cdot \frac{x^2 + 1}{x(x^2 + 2)} \ge 2 \sqrt{\frac{x(x^2 + 2)}{x^2 + 1} \cdot 4 \cdot \frac{x^2 + 1}{x(x^2 + 2)}} = 4,\]so $f(x) \ge 5.$
Equality occurs when
\[\frac{x(x^2 + 2)}{x^2 + 1} = 2,\]or $x(x^2 + 2) = 2x^2 + 2.$  This simplifies to $x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x - 2 = 0.$
Let $g(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x - 2.$  Since $g(1) = -1$ and $g(2) = 2,$ there exists a root of $g(x) = 0$ between 1 and 2
In particular, $g(x) = 0$ has a positive root.
Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x)$ for $x > 0$ is $\boxed{5}.$
We can write $f(x)$ as follows:
\[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
x^2 & \text{if $x > 0$}, \\
0 & \text{if $x = 0$}, \\
-x^2 & \text{if $x < 0$}.
\end{array}
\right.\]Hence, $f^{-1}(4) + f^{-1}(-100) = 2 + (-10) = \boxed{-8}.$
Since we are given the quotient, we do not need long division to find the remainder
Instead, remember that if our remainder is $r(z)$,
$$3z^3-4z^2-14z+3=(3z+5)\left(z^2-3z+\frac{1}{3}\right)+r(z).$$Multiplying the divisor and the quotient gives us
$$(3z+5)\left(z^2-3z+\frac{1}{3}\right)=3z^3+5z^2-9z^2-15z+z+\frac{5}{3} = 3z^3-4z^2-14z+\frac{5}{3} $$Subtracting the above result from the dividend gives us the remainder
$$r(z) = 3z^3-4z^2-14z+3 - \left(3z^3-4z^2-14z+\frac{5}{3}\right) = \boxed{\frac{4}{3}}$$We can make the computation easier by realizing that $r(z)$ is a constant
The constants on both sides must be equal, so
\[3 = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + r(z).\]Hence, $r(z) = 3 - \frac{5}{3} = \frac{4}{3}.$
We can write
\[\frac{a}{|a|} + \frac{b}{|b|} + \frac{c}{|c|} + \frac{abc}{|abc|} = \frac{a}{|a|} + \frac{b}{|b|} + \frac{c}{|c|} + \frac{a}{|a|} \cdot \frac{b}{|b|} \cdot \frac{c}{|c|}.\]Note that $\frac{a}{|a|}$ is 1 if $a$ is positive, and $-1$ if $a$ is negative
Thus, $\frac{a}{|a|}$ depends only on the sign of $a$, and similarly for the terms $\frac{b}{|b|}$ and $\frac{c}{|c|}$.
Furthermore, the expression is symmetric in $a$, $b$, and $c$, so if $k$ is the number of numbers among $a$, $b$, and $c$ that are positive, then the value of the given expression depends only on $k$.
If $k = 3$, then
\[\frac{a}{|a|} + \frac{b}{|b|} + \frac{c}{|c|} + \frac{a}{|a|} \cdot \frac{b}{|b|} \cdot \frac{c}{|c|} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 4.\]If $k = 2$, then
\[\frac{a}{|a|} + \frac{b}{|b|} + \frac{c}{|c|} + \frac{a}{|a|} \cdot \frac{b}{|b|} \cdot \frac{c}{|c|} = 1 + 1 + (-1) + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1) = 0.\]If $k = 1$, then
\[\frac{a}{|a|} + \frac{b}{|b|} + \frac{c}{|c|} + \frac{a}{|a|} \cdot \frac{b}{|b|} \cdot \frac{c}{|c|} = 1 + (-1) + (-1) + 1 \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1) = 0.\]If $k = 0$, then
\[\frac{a}{|a|} + \frac{b}{|b|} + \frac{c}{|c|} + \frac{a}{|a|} \cdot \frac{b}{|b|} \cdot \frac{c}{|c|} = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1) = -4.\]Therefore, the possible values of the expression are $\boxed{4, 0, -4}$.
Completing the square in $x$ gives \[ (x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0
\]Rearranging and taking square roots, we get \[ x-5 = \pm 5y\sqrt{2}
\]We see that this defines $\boxed{\text{two lines}}$, namely $x = 5+ 5y\sqrt{2}$ and $x = 5-5y\sqrt{2}$.
By QM-AM,
\[\sqrt{\frac{(x + \frac{1}{y})^2 + (y + \frac{1}{x})^2}{2}} \ge \frac{(x + \frac{1}{y}) + (y + \frac{1}{x})}{2},\]so
\[\left( x + \frac{1}{y} \right)^2 + \left( y + \frac{1}{x} \right)^2 \ge \frac{1}{2} \left( x + \frac{1}{y} + y + \frac{1}{x} \right)^2.\]Then
\begin{align*}
&\left( x + \frac{1}{y} \right) \left( x + \frac{1}{y} - 2018 \right) + \left( y + \frac{1}{x} \right) \left( y + \frac{1}{x} - 2018 \right) \\
&= \left( x + \frac{1}{y} \right)^2 + \left( y + \frac{1}{x} \right)^2 - 2018 \left( x + \frac{1}{y} \right) - 2018 \left( y + \frac{1}{x} \right) \\
&\ge \frac{1}{2} \left( x + \frac{1}{y} + y + \frac{1}{x} \right)^2 - 2018 \left( x + \frac{1}{y} + y + \frac{1}{x} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} u^2 - 2018u \\
&= \frac{1}{2} (u - 2018)^2 - 2036162,
\end{align*}where $u = x + \frac{1}{y} + y + \frac{1}{x}.$
Equality occurs when $u = 2018$ and $x = y.$  This means $x + \frac{1}{x} = 1009,$ or $x^2 - 1009x + 1 = 0.$  We can check that this quadratic has real roots that are positive, so equality is possible
Thus, the minimum value is $\boxed{-2036162}.$
To get the equation of the asymptotes, we replace the $1$ on the right-hand side with $0,$ giving the equation \[\frac{y^2}{9}-\frac{x^2}{4} = 0.\](Notice that there are no points $(x, y)$ which satisfy both this equation and the given equation, so as expected, the hyperbola never intersects its asymptotes.) This is equivalent to $\frac{y^2}{9} = \frac{x^2}{4},$ or $\frac{y}{3} = \pm \frac{x}{2}.$ Thus, $y = \pm \frac{3}{2} x,$ so $m = \boxed{\frac32}.$[asy]

We can factor $x^{2017} - 2x + 1 = 0$ by writing it as
\begin{align*}
x^{2017} - 1 - 2x + 2 &= (x^{2017} - 1) - 2(x - 1) \\
&= (x - 1)(x^{2016} + x^{2015} + \dots + x + 1) - 2(x - 1) \\
&= (x - 1)(x^{2016} + x^{2015} + \dots + x - 1).
\end{align*}Since $x \neq 1,$ we must have $x^{2016} + x^{2015} + \dots + x - 1 = 0,$ so $x^{2016} + x^{2015} + \dots + x + 1 = \boxed{2}.$
We recognize the given expression as the factorization $(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$ of the difference of cubes $a^3-b^3$, where $a=x^2$ and $b=18$
Thus the product is $a^3-b^3 = (x^2)^3-18^3=\boxed{x^6-5832}$.
By AM-GM,
\[a + b + c + d \ge 4 \sqrt[4]{abcd} = 4 \sqrt[4]{10!} \approx 174.58.\]Since $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ are all integers, $a + b + c + d \ge 175.$
Note that $a = 40,$ $b = 42,$ $c = 45,$ and $d = 48$ satisfy $abcd = 10!,$ and $a + b + c + d = \boxed{175},$ so this is the minimum.
Let $P$ be the polynomial defined by $P(x) =   x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1$
Note that $(x+1)P(x) = x^7 + 1$
So the roots of $P$ are on the unit circle
Hence the roots of each quadratic factor $x^2 + b_kx + c_k$ are also on the unit circle
Because each quadratic factor has real coefficients, its roots come in conjugate pairs
Because the roots are on the unit circle, each $c_k$ is $1$
When we expand the product of the three quadratic factors, we get a polynomial of the form
$$x^6 + (b_1 + b_2 + b_3)x^5 + \dotsb $$Because the coefficient of $x^5$ in $P$ is $-1$, we see that $b_1+b_2+b_3 = -1$
So we have
$$b_1c_1+b_2c_2+b_3c_3 = b_1+b_2+b_3 = \boxed{-1}$$.
First,
\[\sum_{k = 0}^n \log_2 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{2^k}} \right) = \log_2 \left[ \prod_{k = 0}^n \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{2^k}} \right) \right].\]We want to evaluate
\[(1 + x)(1 + x^2)(1 + x^4) \dotsm (1 + x^{2^n})\]at $x = \frac{1}{2}.$  By difference of squares,
\begin{align*}
(1 + x)(1 + x^2)(1 + x^4) \dotsm (1 + x^{2^n}) &= \frac{1 - x^2}{1 - x} \cdot \frac{1 - x^4}{1 - x^2} \cdot \frac{1 - x^8}{1 - x^4} \dotsm \frac{1 - x^{2^{n + 1}}}{1 - x^{2^n}} \\
&= \frac{1 - x^{2^{n + 1}}}{1 - x}.
\end{align*}At $x = \frac{1}{2},$
\[\frac{1 - x^{2^{n + 1}}}{1 - x} = \frac{1 - (\frac{1}{2})^{2^{n + 1}}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^{2^{n + 1}}} \right),\]and
\[\log_2 \left[ 2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^{2^{n + 1}}} \right) \right] = \log_2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^{2^{n + 1}}} \right) + 1.\]Thus, we want the smallest positive integer $n$ such that
\[1 - \frac{1}{2^{2^{n + 1}}} \ge \frac{2014}{2015}.\]This is equivalent to
\[\frac{1}{2^{2^{n + 1}}} \le \frac{1}{2015},\]or $2^{2^{n + 1}} \ge 2015.$
For $n = 2,$ $2^{2^{n + 1}} = 2^{2^3} = 2^8 = 256,$ and for $n = 3,$ $2^{2^{n + 1}} = 2^{2^4} = 2^{16} = 65536,$ so the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{3}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
\frac{(1 + 17) \left( 1 + \dfrac{17}{2} \right) \left( 1 + \dfrac{17}{3} \right) \dotsm \left( 1 + \dfrac{17}{19} \right)}{(1 + 19) \left( 1 + \dfrac{19}{2} \right) \left( 1 + \dfrac{19}{3} \right) \dotsm \left( 1 + \dfrac{19}{17} \right)} &= \frac{\dfrac{18}{1} \cdot \dfrac{19}{2} \cdot \dfrac{20}{3} \dotsm \dfrac{36}{19}}{\dfrac{20}{1} \cdot \dfrac{21}{2} \cdot \dfrac{22}{3} \dotsm \dfrac{36}{17}} \\
&= \frac{\dfrac{36!/17!}{19!}}{\dfrac{36!/19!}{17!}} \\
&= \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
Note that the equation is a sum of squares equaling $0,$ which is only possible if both squares are zero
That is, we must have \[\frac{x^2}{36} = 0 \quad \text{ and } \quad \frac{(y+5)^2}{16} = 0,\]which implies that $x=0$ and $y=-5.$ Since $(x,y)=(0,-5)$ satisfies the given equation, it is the only point on the graph of this equation, so the answer is $\boxed{-5}.$
Let $S$ denote the given sum
\begin{align*}
2S &= (a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{100})^2 - (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_{100}^2) \\
&= (a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{100})^2 - 100.
\end{align*}To find the minimum positive value of $2S,$ we want $(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{100})^2$ to be as close to 100 as possible (while being greater than 100)
Since each $a_i$ is $1$ or $-1,$ $a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{100}$ must be an even integer
Thus, the smallest we could make $(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{100})^2$ is $12^2 = 144.$  This is achievable by setting 56 of the $a_i$ to be equal to $1,$ and the remaining 44 to be equal to $-1.$
Thus, the minimum positive value of $S$ is $\frac{144 - 100}{2} = \boxed{22}.$
Let $n = 2004,$ so the expression becomes \[ \left\lfloor \frac{(n+1)^3}{(n-1)n} - \frac{(n-1)^3}{n(n+1)} \right\rfloor.\]Combining the fractions under the common denominator $(n-1)n(n+1),$ we get \[\begin{aligned} \left\lfloor \frac{(n+1)^3}{(n-1)n} - \frac{(n-1)^3}{n(n+1)} \right\rfloor &= \left\lfloor \frac{(n+1)^4 - (n-1)^4}{(n-1)n(n+1)} \right\rfloor \\ &= \left\lfloor \frac{(n^4+4n^3+6n^2+4n+1) - (n^4-4n^3+6n^2-4n+1)}{(n-1)n(n+1)} \right\rfloor \\ &= \left\lfloor \frac{8n^3+8n}{(n-1)n(n+1)} \right\rfloor \\ &= \left\lfloor \frac{8n(n^2+1)}{(n-1)n(n+1)} \right\rfloor \\ &= \left\lfloor \frac{8(n^2+1)}{n^2-1} \right\rfloor
\end{aligned}\]Because $\frac{n^2+1}{n^2-1}$ is a little greater than $1,$ we expect $\frac{8(n^2+1)}{n^2-1}$ to be a little greater than $8,$ which makes the floor equal to $\boxed{8}.$
Indeed, we have \[\frac{n^2+1}{n^2-1} = 1 + \frac{2}{n^2-1} = 1 + \frac{2}{2004^2 - 1} < 1 + \frac{2}{1000} = 1.002,\]so $\frac{8(n^2+1)}{n^2-1} < 8.016,$ so $8 < \frac{8(n^2+1)}{n^2-1} < 8.016 < 9,$ as claimed.
Let $X$ denote the desired sum
Note that \begin{align*}
X &= \phantom{\frac{0}{4^0} + \frac{0}{4^1} +\text{}} \frac{1}{4^2} +
\frac{1}{4^3} + \frac{2}{4^4} + \frac{3}{4^5} + \frac{5}{4^6} +\dotsb
4X &= \phantom{\frac{0}{4^0} + \text{}} \frac{1}{4^1} + \frac{1}{4^2} +
\frac{2}{4^3} + \frac{3}{4^4} + \frac{5}{4^5} + \frac{8}{4^6} +\dotsb
16X&= \frac{1}{4^0} + \frac{1}{4^1} + \frac{2}{4^2} + \frac{3}{4^3} +
\frac{5}{4^4} + \frac{8}{4^5} + \frac{13}{4^6} +\dotsb
\end{align*}so that $X + 4X = 16X-1$, and $X=\boxed{\frac{1}{11}}$.
If $x < -2,$ then
\[|x - 1| + |x + 2| = -(x - 1) - (x + 2) = -2x - 1.\]Solving $-2x - 1 < 5,$ we get $x > -3.$  So, the values of $x$ that work in this case are $-3 < x < -2.$
If $-2 \le x < 1,$ then
\[|x - 1| + |x + 2| = -(x - 1) + (x + 2) = 3.\]All values in $-2 \le x < 1$ work.
If $1 \le x,$ then
\[|x - 1| + |x + 2| = (x - 1) + (x + 2) = 2x + 1.\]Solving $2x + 1 < 5,$ we get $x < 2.$  So the values of $x$ that work in this case are $1 \le x < 2.$
Therefore, the solution is $x \in \boxed{(-3,2)}.$
We can write $r^5 - 1 = 0,$ which factors as
\[(r - 1)(r^4 + r^3 + r^2 + r + 1) = 0.\]Since $r \neq 1,$ $r^4 + r^3 + r^2 + r + 1 = 0.$
To compute the product, we can arrange the factors in pairs:
\begin{align*}
(r - 1)(r^2 - 1)(r^3 - 1)(r^4 - 1) &= [(r - 1)(r^4 - 1)][(r^2 - 1)(r^3 - 1)] \\
&= (r^5 - r - r^4 + 1)(r^5 - r^2 - r^3 + 1) \\
&= (1 - r - r^4 + 1)(1 - r^2 - r^3 + 1) \\
&= (2 - r - r^4)(2 - r^2 - r^3) \\
&= 4 - 2r^2 - 2r^3 - 2r + r^3 + r^4 - 2r^4 + r^6 + r^7 \\
&= 4 - 2r^2 - 2r^3 - 2r + r^3 + r^4 - 2r^4 + r + r^2 \\
&= 4 - r - r^2 - r^3 - r^4 \\
&= 5 - (1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4) = \boxed{5}.
\end{align*}
First, consider the case where $z$ is between $z^2$ and $z^3.$  The diagram may look like the following:
unitsize(0.4 cm);
pair z, zsquare, zcube, w;
z = (0,0);
zsquare = (5,-2);
zcube = (2,5);
w = zsquare + zcube - z;
draw(z--zsquare,Arrow(8));
draw(z--zcube,Arrow(8));
draw(rightanglemark(zcube,z,zsquare,20));
draw(zcube--w--zsquare,dashed);
label("$z^2 - z$", (z + zsquare)/2, S);
label("$z^3 - z$", (z + zcube)/2, NW);
dot("$z$", z, SW);
dot("$z^2$", zsquare, SE);
dot("$z^3$", zcube, NW);
dot(w);
[/asy]
The arrows in the diagram correspond to the complex numbers $z^3 - z$ and $z^2 - z,$ which are at $90^\circ$ angle to each other
Thus, we can obtain one complex number by multiplying the other by $i.$  Here, $z^3 - z = i (z^2 - z).$
Another possible diagram is as follows:
unitsize(0.4 cm);
pair z, zsquare, zcube, w;
z = (0,0);
zsquare = (2,5);
zcube = (5,-2);
w = zsquare + zcube - z;
draw(z--zsquare,Arrow(8));
draw(z--zcube,Arrow(8));
draw(rightanglemark(zcube,z,zsquare,20));
draw(zcube--w--zsquare,dashed);
label("$z^2 - z$", (z + zsquare)/2, NW);
label("$z^3 - z$", (z + zcube)/2, S);
dot("$z$", z, SW);
dot("$z^2$", zsquare, NW);
dot("$z^3$", zcube, SE);
dot(w);
[/asy]
Here, $z^3 - z = -i(z^2 - z).$  Thus, we can combine both equations as
\[z^3 - z = \pm i (z^2 - z).\]We can factor as
\[z(z - 1)(z + 1) = \pm iz(z - 1).\]Since the square is nondegenerate, $z \neq 0$ and $z \neq 1.$  We can then safely divide both sides by $z(z - 1),$ to get
\[z + 1 = \pm i.\]For $z = -1 + i,$ the area of the square is
\[|z^2 - z|^2 = |z|^2 |z - 1|^2 = |-1 + i|^2 |-2 + i|^2 = 10.\]For $z = -1 - i,$ the area of the square is
\[|z^2 - z|^2 = |z|^2 |z - 1|^2 = |-1 - i|^2 |-2 - i|^2 = 10.\]Another case is where $z^2$ is between $z$ and $z^3.$
unitsize(0.4 cm);
pair z, zsquare, zcube, w;
z = (2,5);
zsquare = (0,0);
zcube = (5,-2);
w = z + zcube - zsquare;
draw(zsquare--z,Arrow(8));
draw(zsquare--zcube,Arrow(8));
draw(rightanglemark(z,zsquare,zcube,20));
draw(z--w--zcube,dashed);
label("$z - z^2$", (z + zsquare)/2, NW);
label("$z^3 - z^2$", (zsquare + zcube)/2, SSW);
dot("$z$", z, NW);
dot("$z^2$", zsquare, SW);
dot("$z^3$", zcube, SE);
dot(w);
[/asy]
This gives us the equation
\[z^3 - z^2 = \pm i (z - z^2).\]We can factor as
\[z^2 (z - 1) = \pm iz(z - 1).\]Then $z = \pm i.$
For $z = i,$ the area of the square is
\[|z^2 - z|^2 = |z|^2 |z - 1|^2 = |i|^2 |i - 1|^2 = 2.\]For $z = -i$, the area of the square is
\[|z^2 - z|^2 = |z|^2 |z - 1|^2 = |-i|^2 |-i - 1|^2 = 2.\]The final case is where $z^3$ is between $z$ and $z^2.$
unitsize(0.4 cm);
pair z, zsquare, zcube, w;
z = (2,5);
zsquare = (5,-2);
zcube = (0,0);
w = z + zsquare - zcube;

This gives us the equation
\[z^3 - z^2 = \pm i(z^3 - z).\]We can factor as
\[z^2 (z - 1) = \pm i z(z - 1)(z + 1).\]Then $z = \pm i(z + 1).$  Solving $z = i(z + 1),$ we find $z = \frac{-1 + i}{2}.$  Then the area of the square is
\[|z^3 - z^2|^2 = |z|^4 |z - 1|^2 = \left| \frac{-1 + i}{2} \right|^4 \left| \frac{-3 + i}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{2} = \frac{5}{8}.\]Solving $z = -i(z + 1),$ we find $z = \frac{-1 - i}{2}.$  Then the area of the square is
\[|z^3 - z^2|^2 = |z|^4 |z - 1|^2 = \left| \frac{-1 - i}{2} \right|^4 \left| \frac{-3 - i}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{2} = \frac{5}{8}.\]Therefore, the possible areas of the square are $\boxed{\frac{5}{8}, 2, 10}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
\prod_{n = 1}^{20} &= \frac{4}{1} \cdot \frac{5}{2} \cdot \frac{6}{3} \cdot \frac{7}{4} \dotsm \frac{20}{17} \cdot \frac{21}{18} \cdot \frac{22}{19} \cdot \frac{23}{20} \\
&= \frac{21 \cdot 22 \cdot 23}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3} = \boxed{1771}.
\end{align*}
Note that \[2010 = a^2 - b^2 + c^2 - d^2 = (a-b)(a+b) + (c-d)(c+d).\]If either $a-b > 1$ or $c-d > 1,$ then \[(a-b)(a+b) + (c-d)(c+d) > (a+b) + (c+d) = 2010,\]which is a contradiction
Therefore, we must have $a-b=1$ and $c-d=1.$ In other words, setting $b=a-1$ and $d=c-1,$ we have \[a+b+c+d = 2a+2c-2 = 2010 \implies a+c = 1006,\]and we must have $a \ge c+2,$ $c \ge 2.$ The pairs $(a, c)$ satisfying these conditions are $(a, c) = (1004, 2), (1003, 3), \ldots, (504, 502),$ which makes $\boxed{501}$ possible values for $a.$
Since the polynomial has real coefficients, the other root must be $3 - i.$  Thus, the polynomial is
\begin{align*}
2(x - 3 - i)(x - 3 + i) &= 2((x - 3)^2 - i^2) \\
&= 2((x - 3)^2 + 1) \\
&= \boxed{2x^2 - 12x + 20}.
\end{align*}
Setting $x = -1,$ $x = 1,$ and $x = 2,$ we get
\begin{align*}
1 = P(-1) &= P(0) - P(1) + P(2), \\
P(1) &= P(0) + P(1) + P(2), \\
P(2) &= P(0) + 2P(1) + 4P(2),
\end{align*}respectively
Solving this as a system of equations in $P(0),$ $P(1),$ and $P(2),$ we get $P(0) = -1,$ $P(1) = -1,$ and $P(2) = 1,$ so
\[P(x) = \boxed{x^2 - x - 1}.\]
Let $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ be the roots of the quartic
Let $A$ be the point corresponding to complex number $a,$ etc.
Let $O$ be the center of the rhombus
Then the complex number corresponding to $O$ is the average of $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d.$  By Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = -\frac{8i}{2} = -4i,$ so their average is $\frac{-4i}{4} = -i.$  Hence, $O$ is located at $-i.$

Let $p = OA$ and $q = OB.$  Then we want to compute the area of the rhombus, which is $4 \cdot \frac{1}{2} pq = 2pq.$
We see that $p = |a + i| = |c + i|$ and $q = |b + i| = |d + i|.$
Since $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ are the roots of the quartic in the problem, we can write
\[2z^4 + 8iz^3 + (-9 + 9i)z^2 + (-18 - 2i)z + (3 - 12i) = 2(z - a)(z - b)(z - c)(z - d).\]Setting $z = -i,$ we get
\[4 - 3i = 2(-i - a)(-i - b)(-i - c)(-i - d).\]Taking the absolute value of both sides, we get
\[5 = 2 |(a + i)(b + i)(c + i)(d + i)| = 2p^2 q^2.\]Then $4p^2 q^2 = 10,$ so $2pq = \boxed{\sqrt{10}}.$
First, we can factor the denominator with a little give and take:
\begin{align*}
n^4 + 4 &= n^4 + 4n^2 + 4 - 4n^2 \\
&= (n^2 + 2)^2 - (2n)^2 \\
&= (n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2).
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n}{n^4 + 4} & = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)} \\
&= \frac{1}{4} \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{(n^2 + 2n + 2) - (n^2 - 2n + 2)}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)} \\
&= \frac 1 4 \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^2 - 2n + 2} - \frac{1}{n^2 + 2n + 2} \right) \\
&= \frac 1 4 \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(n-1)^2 + 1} - \frac{1}{(n+1)^2 + 1} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{4} \left[ \left( \frac{1}{0^2 + 1} - \frac{1}{2^2 + 1} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{1^2 + 1} - \frac{1}{3^2 + 1} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{2^2 + 1} - \frac{1}{4^2 + 1} \right) + \dotsb \right].
\end{align*}Observe that the sum telescopes
From this we find that the answer is $\dfrac 1 4 \left( \dfrac{1}{0^2 + 1} + \dfrac 1 {1^2 + 1} \right) = \boxed{\dfrac 3 8}$.
The two vertices that lie on $y = x^2$ must lie on a line of the form $y = 2x + k.$  Setting $y = x^2,$ we get $x^2 = 2x + k,$ so $x^2 - 2x - k = 0.$  Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this quadratic, so by Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1 x_2 = -k.$
The two vertices on the parabola are then $(x_1, 2x_1 + k)$ and $(x_2, 2x_2 + k),$ and the square of the distance between them is
\begin{align*}
(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (2x_1 - 2x_2)^2 &= 5(x_1 - x_2)^2 \\
&= 5[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1 x_2] \\
&= 5 (4 + 4k) \\
&= 20(k + 1).

[/asy]
The point $(0,k)$ lies on the line $y = 2x + k,$ and its distance to the line $y - 2x + 17 = 0$ is
\[\frac{|k + 17|}{\sqrt{5}}.\]Hence,
\[20 (k + 1) = \frac{(k + 17)^2}{5}.\]This simplifies to $k^2 - 66k + 189 = 0,$ which factors as $(k - 3)(k - 63) = 0.$  Hence, $k = 3$ or $k = 63.$
We want to find the smallest possible area of the square, so we take $k = 3.$  This gives us $20(k + 1) = \boxed{80}.$
To eliminate the fractions, we multiply by $(x^2+4x+1)(x^2-10x)$ on both sides, giving \[(x-2)(x^2-10x) = (x-5)(x^2+4x+1).\]Expanding both sides yields \[x^3 - 12x^2 + 20x = x^3 -x^2 -19x -5,\]and so \[0 =11x^2 -39 x -5.\]By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this equation is $\boxed{\tfrac{39}{11}}\,.$ (One can compute the roots explicitly and check that they do not make any of the denominators of the original equation equal to zero.)
The graph has vertical asymptotes at $x=-1$ and $x=1$
Since there is a vertical asymptote at $x=-1$, there must be a factor of $x+1$ in the denominator $q(x)$
Similarly, since there is a vertical asymptote at $x=1$, there must be a factor of $x-1$ in the denominator $q(x)$
Since $q(x)$ is quadratic, we have that $q(x) = a(x-1)(x+1)$, for some constant $a$
Since $q(2) = 6$, we have $a(2-1)(2+1) = 6$ and hence $a=2$.
So $q(x) = 2(x - 1)(x + 1) = \boxed{2x^2 - 2}.$
We write
\[x \sqrt{12 - x} + \sqrt{12x - x^3} = \sqrt{12 - x} \cdot \sqrt{x^2} + \sqrt{x} \cdot \sqrt{12 - x^2}\]By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(\sqrt{12 - x} \cdot \sqrt{x^2} + \sqrt{x} \cdot \sqrt{12 - x^2})^2 \le (12 - x + x)(x^2 + 12 - x^2) = 144,\]so
\[\sqrt{12 - x} \cdot \sqrt{x^2} + \sqrt{x} \cdot \sqrt{12 - x^2} \le 12.\]But $\sqrt{12 - x} \cdot \sqrt{x^2} + \sqrt{x} \cdot \sqrt{12 - x^2} \ge 12,$ so the expression must be equal to 12
From the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{12 - x}{x} = \frac{x^2}{12 - x^2}.\]Then $(12 - x)(12 - x^2) = x^3,$ which simplifies to $x^2 + x - 12 = 0.$  This factors as $(x - 3)(x + 4) = 0,$ so the only solution is $x = \boxed{3}.$
We see that the semi-major axis is $a = 6,$ and the semi-minor axis is $b = 2,$ so $c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = 4 \sqrt{2}.$  Hence, the distance between the foci is $2c = \boxed{8 \sqrt{2}}.$
Since $k$ is odd, $f(k) = k + 3.$  Then $k + 3$ is even, so
\[f(k + 3) = \frac{k + 3}{2}.\]If $\frac{k + 3}{2}$ is odd, then
\[f \left( \frac{k + 3}{2} \right) = \frac{k + 3}{2} + 3 = 27.\]This leads to $k = 45.$  But $f(f(f(45))) = f(f(48)) = f(24) = 12,$ so $\frac{k + 3}{2}$ must be even
\[f \left( \frac{k + 3}{2} \right) = \frac{k + 3}{4} = 27.\]This leads to $k = 105.$  Checking, we find $f(f(f(105))) = f(f(108)) = f(54) = 27.$
Therefore, $k = \boxed{105}.$
We want to find the sum
\begin{align*}
&\quad \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{4^2} + \dotsb \\
&+ \frac{1}{2^3} + \frac{1}{3^3} + \frac{1}{4^3} + \dotsb \\
&+ \frac{1}{2^4} + \frac{1}{3^4} + \frac{1}{4^4} + \dotsb \\
&+ \dotsb.
\end{align*}The sum of the numbers in the $n$th column is an infinite geometric series, with first term $\frac{1}{(n + 1)^2}$ and common ratio $\frac{1}{n + 1},$ so the sum of its terms is
\[\frac{\frac{1}{(n + 1)^2}}{1 - \frac{1}{n + 1}} = \frac{1}{n(n + 1)} = \frac{(n + 1) - n}{n(n + 1)} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n + 1}.\]Hence, the sum of the terms is
\[\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n + 1} \right) = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} \right) + \dotsb = \boxed{1}.\]
We recognize that $|2x-36| = 2|x-18|,$ so we get \[|x-20| = |x-18|.\]This means that, on the number line, $x$ is equidistant from $20$ and $18.$ Therefore $x$ must lie halfway between $20$ and $18,$ so \[x = \frac{20+18}{2} = \boxed{19}.\]
Let the three roots of the equation be $a,$ $a,$ and $b.$ Then by Vieta's formulas, \[\begin{aligned}a+a+b&=-\tfrac82=-4, \\ ab+ab+a^2 &= \tfrac{120}2 = -60
\end{aligned}\]These equations simplify to $2a+b=-4$ and $2ab+a^2=-60.$ From the first equation, we get $b=-4-2a,$ and substituting into the second equation gives \[2a(-4-2a)+a^2=-60,\]or \[3a^2+8a-60=0.\]This factors as \[(a+6)(3a-10)=0,\]so either $a=-6$ or $a=\tfrac{10}{3}.$ If $a=-6$, then $b=-4-2a=8,$ so by Vieta, $k = -2a^2b=-576,$ which is not positive
If $a=\tfrac{10}{3},$ then $b=-4-2a=-\tfrac{32}{3},$ so by Vieta, $k=-2a^2b=\boxed{\tfrac{6400}{27}},$ which is the answer.
First, we decompose $\frac{2n + 1}{n(n + 1)(n + 2)}$ into partial fractions
\[\frac{2n + 1}{n(n + 1)(n + 2)} = \frac{A}{n} + \frac{B}{n + 1} + \frac{C}{n + 2}.\]Then
\[2n + 1 = A(n + 1)(n + 2) + Bn(n + 2) + Cn(n + 1).\]Setting $n = 0,$ we get $2A = 1,$ so $A = \frac{1}{2}.$
Setting $n = -1,$ we get $-B = -1,$ so $B = 1.$
Setting $n = -2,$ we get $2C = -3,$ so $C = -\frac{3}{2}.$  Hence,
\[\frac{2n + 1}{n(n + 1)(n + 2)} = \frac{1/2}{n} + \frac{1}{n + 1} - \frac{3/2}{n + 2}.\]Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{2n + 1}{n(n + 1)(n + 2)} &= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1/2}{n} + \frac{1}{n + 1} - \frac{3/2}{n + 2} \right) \\
&= \left( \frac{1/2}{1} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3/2}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{1/2}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{3/2}{4} \right) + \left( \frac{1/2}{3} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{3/2}{5} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \frac{1/2}{1} + \frac{3/2}{2} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{5}{4}}.
\end{align*}
Setting $x = 2,$ we get
\[f(2) - 2 f \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = 16.\]Setting $x = 1/2,$ we get
\[f \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) - 2f(2) = 2.\]Solving these equations as a system in $f(2)$ and $f \left( \frac{1}{2} \right),$ we obtain $f(2) = \boxed{-\frac{20}{3}}$ and $f \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = -\frac{34}{3}.$
From the given inequality,
\[\frac{x + 1}{x + 2} - \frac{3x + 4}{2x + 9} > 0,\]which simplifies to
\[-\frac{x^2 - x - 1}{(x + 2)(2x + 9)} > 0,\]or
\[\frac{x^2 - x - 1}{(x + 2)(2x + 9)} < 0.\]The solutions to $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$ are $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.$  We can fill in a sign chart as follows:
\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
& x < -\frac{9}{2} & -\frac{9}{2} < x < -2 & -2 < x < \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} & \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} < x < \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} & \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} < x \\ \hline
2x + 9 & - & + & + & + & + \\
x + 2 & - & - & + & + & + \\
x - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} & - & - & - & + & + \\
x - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} & - & - & - & - & + \\
\frac{x^2 - x - 1}{(x + 2)(2x + 9)} & + & - & + & - & +
\end{array}
\]Thus, the solution to $\frac{x^2 - x - 1}{(x + 2)(2x + 9)} < 0$ is
\[x \in \boxed{\left( -\frac{9}{2} , -2 \right) \cup \left( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}, \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)}.\]
In the given ellipse, $a = 5$ and $b = 3,$ so $c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = 4.$  We can take $F = (4,0).$
Let $A = (x,y).$  Then $\frac{x^2}{25} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1$ and
\[(x - 4)^2 + y^2 = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{4}.\]Solving for $y^2$ in $\frac{x^2}{25} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1,$ we get
\[y^2 = \frac{225 - 9x^2}{25}.\]Substituting, we get
\[(x - 4)^2 + \frac{225 - 9x^2}{25} = \frac{9}{4}.\]This simplifies to $64x^2 - 800x + 2275 = 0,$ which factors as $(8x - 65)(8x - 35) = 0.$  Since $x \le 5,$ $x = \frac{35}{8}.$  Then
\[\frac{(35/8)^2}{25} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1.\]This leads to $y^2 = \frac{135}{64},$ so $y = \frac{\sqrt{135}}{8} = \pm \frac{3 \sqrt{15}}{8}.$  We can take $y = \frac{3 \sqrt{15}}{8}.$
Thus, the slope of line $AB$ is
\[\frac{\frac{3 \sqrt{15}}{8}}{\frac{35}{8} - 4} = \sqrt{15},\]so its equation is
\[y = \sqrt{15} (x - 4).\]To find $B,$ we substitute into the equation of the ellipse, to get
\[\frac{x^2}{25} + \frac{15 (x - 4)^2}{9} = 1.\]This simplifies to $128x^2 - 1000x + 1925 = 0.$  We could try factoring it, but we know that $x = \frac{35}{8}$ is a solution (because we are solving for the intersection of the line and the ellipse, and $A$ is an intersection point.)  Hence, by Vieta's formulas, the other solution is
\[x = \frac{1000}{128} - \frac{35}{8} = \frac{55}{16}.\]Then $y = \sqrt{15} (x - 4) = -\frac{9 \sqrt{15}}{16}.$  Hence,
\[BF = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{55}{16} - 4 \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{9 \sqrt{15}}{16} \right)^2} = \boxed{\frac{9}{4}}.\]
We can factor the numerator, to get
\[\frac{(x - 5)(x + 5)}{x + 5} < 0.\]If $x \neq -5,$ then this simplifies to $x - 5 < 0.$  Since the expression is not defined for $x = -5,$ the solution is
\[x \in \boxed{(-\infty,-5) \cup (-5,5)}.\]
Since $\pi < 7,$
\[|\pi - 7| = 7 - \pi.\]Hence,
\[|\pi - |\pi - 7|| = |\pi - (7 - \pi)| = |2 \pi - 7|.\]We know that $\pi \approx 3.1416 < \frac{7}{2},$ so
\[|2 \pi - 7| = \boxed{7 - 2 \pi}.\]
Applying the logarithmic identities $\log_a b^c=c\log_a b$ and $\log_{a^c} b=(1/c) \log_a b$, we find \begin{align*}
10 &= \log_4 x + \log_2 x^2 \\
&= \log_4 x + 2 \log_2 x \\
&= \log_{2^2} x + 2 \log_2 x \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \log_2 x + 2 \log_2 x \\
&= \frac{5}{2} \log_2 x.
\end{align*}Therefore, $\log_2 x = 4$, which implies $x = 2^4 = \boxed{16}$.
The $n$th term of the series is given by
\[\frac{4n + 1}{(4n - 1)^2 (4n + 3)^2}.\]Note that
\begin{align*}
(4n + 3)^2 - (4n - 1)^2 &= [(4n + 3) + (4n - 1)][(4n + 3) - (4n - 1)] \\
&= (8n + 2)(4) = 8(4n + 1),
\end{align*}so we can write
\begin{align*}
\frac{4n + 1}{(4n - 1)^2 (4n + 3)^2} &= \frac{1}{8} \left[ \frac{(4n + 3)^2 - (4n - 1)^2}{(4n - 1)^2 (4n + 3)^2} \right] \\
&= \frac{1}{8} \left( \frac{1}{(4n - 1)^2} - \frac{1}{(4n + 3)^2} \right).
\end{align*}Thus,
\begin{align*}
\frac{5}{3^2 \cdot 7^2} + \frac{9}{7^2 \cdot 11^2} + \frac{13}{11^2 \cdot 15^2} + \dotsb &= \frac{1}{8} \left( \frac{1}{3^2} - \frac{1}{7^2} \right) + \frac{1}{8} \left( \frac{1}{7^2} - \frac{1}{11^2} \right) + \frac{1}{8} \left( \frac{1}{11^2} - \frac{1}{15^2} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{3^2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{72}}.
\end{align*}
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero
The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root
Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares
The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares.
Recall that $\log_2 \frac{x}{y} = \log_2 x - \log_2 y$
Applying this identity to each term in the sum, we find that the sum is equal to to $(\log_2 2 - \log_2 1) + (\log_2 3 - \log_2 2) + \cdots + (\log_2 2010 - \log_2 2009)$
Most of the intermediate terms cancel out; the expression eventually evaluates to
\[\log_2 2010 - \log_2 1 = \log_2 2010.\]Note that $2^{10} = 1024$, but $2^{11} = 2048$, so $10 < \log_2 2010 < 11$
It follows that the largest integer less than $\log_2 \frac{2}{1} + \log_2 \frac{3}{2} + \cdots + \log_2 \frac{2009}{2008} + \log_2 \frac{2010}{2009}$ is $\boxed{10}$.
We have that
\begin{align*}
ak^3 + bk^2 + ck + d &= 0, \\
bk^3 + ck^2 + dk + a &= 0.
\end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by $k,$ we get
\[ak^4 + bk^3 + ck^2 + dk = 0.\]Subtracting the equation $bk^3 + ck^2 + dk + a = 0,$ we get $ak^4 = a.$  Since $a$ is nonzero, $k^4 = 1.$  Then $k^4 - 1 = 0,$ which factors as
\[(k - 1)(k + 1)(k^2 + 1) = 0.\]This means $k$ is one of $1,$ $-1,$ $i,$ or $-i.$
If $a = b = c = d = 1,$ then $-1,$ $i,$ and $-i$ are roots of both polynomials
If $a = b = c = 1$ and $d = -3,$ then 1 is a root of both polynomials
Therefore, the possible values of $k$ are $\boxed{1,-1,i,-i}.$
By AM-GM,
\[x^2 + 1 \ge 2x,\]so
\[\frac{x^2 + 3x + 1}{x} \ge \frac{5x}{x} = 5.\]Likewise,
\[\frac{y^2 + 3y + 1}{y} \ge 5\]and
\[\frac{z^2 + 3z + 1}{z} \ge 5,\]so
\[\frac{(x^2 + 3x + 1)(y^2 + 3y + 1)(z^2 + 3z + 1)}{xyz} \ge 125.\]Equality occurs when $x = y = z = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{125}.$
From the given information, we have that the three numbers $\sqrt{36+k}, \; \sqrt{300+k}, \; \sqrt{596+k}$ form an arithmetic progression, in that order
Therefore, we have \[2\sqrt{300+k} = \sqrt{36+k} + \sqrt{596+k}.\]Squaring both sides of the equation, we get \[4(300+k) = (36+k) + 2\sqrt{(36+k)(596+k)} + (596+k)\]or \[568 + 2k = 2\sqrt{(36+k)(596+k)}.\]Dividing by $2$ and then squaring again, we have \[(284+k)^2 = (36+k)(596+k),\]or \[284^2 + 2 \cdot 284k + k^2 = 36 \cdot 596 + 632k + k^2.\]Thus, \[k = \frac{284^2 - 36 \cdot 596}{632 - 2\cdot 284} = \frac{284^2 - 36 \cdot 596}{64} = \boxed{925}.\]
Let $a$ be the first term
\[S_n = \frac{n [2a + (n - 1) 3]}{2}\]and
\[S_{3n} = \frac{3n [2a + (3n - 1) 3]}{2},\]so
\[\frac{S_{3n}}{S_n} = \frac{\frac{3n [2a + (3n - 1) 3]}{2}}{\frac{n [2a + (n - 1) 3]}{2}} = \frac{3(2a + 9n - 3)}{2a + 3n - 3} = \frac{6a + 27n - 9}{2a + 3n - 3}.\]Let this constant be $c,$ so
\[\frac{6a + 27n - 9}{2a + 3n - 3} = c.\]Then $6a + 27n - 9 = 2ac + 3cn - 3c.$  Since both sides are equal for all $n,$ the coefficients of $n$ must be equal
In other words, $27 = 3c,$ so $c = 9.$  then $6a - 9 = 18a - 27.$  Solving, we find $a = \boxed{\frac{3}{2}}.$
By AM-GM,
\[60 = 4x + 9y \ge 2 \sqrt{(4x)(9y)} = 2 \sqrt{36xy} = 12 \sqrt{xy},\]so $\sqrt{xy} \le 5.$  Hence, $xy \le 25.$
Equality occurs when $4x = 9y.$  Along with the condition $4x + 9y = 60,$ we can solve to get $x = \frac{15}{2}$ and $y = \frac{10}{3},$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{25}.$
We try to solve the equation for a general value of $c.$ If $x$ is an integer, then $\lfloor x\rfloor = \lceil x \rceil = x,$ and so we get the equation \[ 7x + 2x = c,\]so $x = \frac{c}{9}.$ Since $x$ is an integer in this case, this solution is valid if and only if $c$ is a multiple of $9.$
If $x$ is not an integer, then $\lceil x \rceil = \lfloor x\rfloor + 1,$ so we get the equation
\[7 \lfloor x\rfloor + 2 (\lfloor x \rfloor + 1) = c,\]so $\lfloor x\rfloor = \frac{c-2}{9}.$ Since $\lfloor x\rfloor$ must be an integer, this produces valid solutions for $x$ if and only if $c-2$ is a multiple of $9.$
Putting everything together, we see that in the interval $[0, 1000],$ there are $112$ multiples of $9$ and $111$ integers which are $2$ more than a multiple of $9,$ for a total of $112 + 111 = \boxed{223}$ possible values of $c.$
In general, when a polynomial is divided by a polynomial of degree $d,$ then the possible degrees of the remainder are 0, 1, 2, $\dots,$ $d - 1.$  Therefore, the possible degrees of the remainder here are $\boxed{0,1}.$
Let $S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dots + a_{17}.$  Then from the given condition,
\[a_i^2 = S - a_i\]for all $1 \le i \le 17.$  In other words, each $a_i$ is a root of
\[x^2 + x - S = 0.\]This quadratic has at most two roots, which means that there are at most two different values among the $a_i,$ for any particular 17-tuple.
Suppose that all the $a_i$ are equal, say
\[a = a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = \dots = a_{17}.\]Then $S = 17a,$ so from the equation $x^2 + x - S = 0,$
\[a^2 + a - 17a = 0.\]Then $a^2 - 16a = a(a - 16) = 0,$ so $a = 0$ or $a = 16.$
Otherwise, there are exactly two different values among the $a_i,$ say $a$ and $b.$  Suppose that $n$ of the $a_i$ are equal to $a,$ so the remaining $17 - n$ values are equal to $b,$ where $1 \le n \le 16.$  Then
\[S = na + (17 - n) b.\]Since $a$ and $b$ are the roots of $x^2 + x - S = 0,$ by Vieta's formulas, $a + b = -1$ and $ab = -S.$  Hence,
\[na + (17 - n) b = -ab.\]From $a + b = -1,$ $b = -a - 1.$  Substituting, we get
\[na + (17 - n)(-a - 1) = -a(-a - 1).\]This simplifies to
\[a^2 + (-2n + 18) a - n + 17 = 0
\quad (*)\]Since $a$ is an integer, the discriminant of this polynomial must be a perfect square
\[(-2n + 18)^2 - 4(-n + 17) = 4n^2 - 68n + 256 = 4(n^2 - 17n + 64)\]is a perfect square, which means $n^2 - 17n + 64$ is a perfect square.
Checking all values in $1 \le a \le 16,$ we find that $n^2 - 17n + 64$ is a perfect square only for $n = 5$ and $n = 12.$
For $n = 5,$ equation $(*)$ becomes
\[a^2 + 8a + 12 = (a + 2)(a + 6) = 0,\]so $a = -2$ or $a = -6.$  The respective values of $b$ are $b = 1$ and $b = 5.$
So one possibility is that five of the $a_i$ are equal to $-2,$ and the remaining 12 are equal to 1
There are $\binom{17}{5} = 6188$ 17-tuples of this form
Another possibility is that five of the $a_i$ are equal to $-6,$ and the remaining 12 are equal to 5
There are $\binom{17}{5} = 6188$ 17-tuples of this form.
The case $n = 12$ leads to the same possibilities
Therefore, the total number of 17-tuples is $2 + 6188 + 6188 = \boxed{12378}.$
By Vieta's formulas, $rst = \frac{6}{2} = \boxed{3}.$
by Vieta's formulas, $a + b = 4$ and $ab = 5.$  Then
\begin{align*}
a^3 + b^3 &= (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) \\
&= (a + b)(a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - 3ab) \\
&= (a + b)((a + b)^2 - 3ab) \\
&= 4 \cdot (4^2 - 3 \cdot 5) \\
\end{align*}and
\begin{align*}
a^4 b^2 + a^2 b^4 &= a^2 b^2 (a^2 + b^2) \\
&= (ab)^2 ((a + b)^2 - 2ab) \\
&= 5^2 (4^2 - 2 \cdot 5) \\
&= 150,
\end{align*}so $a^3 + a^4 b^2 + a^2 b^4 + b^3 = \boxed{154}.$
Since $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the roots of $x^2 + px + 1 = 0,$
\[(x - \alpha)(x - \beta) = x^2 + px + 1.\]Setting $x = \gamma,$ we get
\[(\gamma - \alpha)(\gamma - \beta) = \gamma^2 + p \gamma + 1.\]or $(\alpha - \gamma)(\beta - \gamma) = \gamma^2 + p \gamma + 1.$
Setting $x = -\delta,$ we get
\[(-\delta - \alpha)(-\delta - \beta) = \delta^2 - p \delta + 1,\]or $(\alpha + \beta)(\beta + \delta) = \delta^2 - p \delta + 1.$
Since $\gamma$ and $\delta$ are the roots of $x^2 + qx + 1 = 0,$ $\gamma^2 + q \gamma + 1 = 0$ and $\delta^2 + q \delta + 1 = 0.$  Then
\[\gamma^2 + p \gamma + 1 = (p - q) \gamma\]and
\[\delta^2 - p \delta + 1 = -(p + q) \delta.\]Finally, by Vieta's formulas, $\gamma \delta = 1,$ so
\[(p - q) \gamma \cdot (-(p + q)) \delta = (q - p)(q + p) = \boxed{q^2 - p^2}.\]
Let $t = \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x}.$ Then we have \[t^2 = \left(\frac{x}{y}+\frac{y}{x}\right)^2 = \frac{x^2}{y^2} + 2 + \frac{y^2}{x^2},\]so $t^2 - 2 = \frac{x^2}{y^2} + \frac{y^2}{x^2},$ and the equation becomes \[3 = k^2 (t^2 - 2) + kt.\]Rearranging, we have the quadratic \[0 = k^2t^2 + kt- (2k^2+3).\]By the quadratic formula, \[t = \frac{-k \pm \sqrt{k^2 + 4k^2(2k^2+3)}}{2k^2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{8k^2+13}}{2k}.\]Since $x$ and $y$ are positive, $t$ is also positive, and furthermore, \[t = \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x} \ge 2\sqrt{\frac{x}{y} \cdot \frac{y}{x}} = 2\]by AM-GM
Therefore, the above equation must have a root in the interval $[2, \infty).$ It follows that \[\frac{-1 + \sqrt{8k^2+13}}{2k} \ge 2.\]Multiplying both sides by $2k$ and adding $1,$ we get $\sqrt{8k^2+13} \ge 4k+1.$ Then $8k^2+13 \ge (4k+1)^2 = 16k^2 + 8k + 1,$ so \[0 \ge 8k^2 + 8k - 12.\]By the quadratic formula, the roots of $8k^2+8k-12=0$ are \[k = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 + 4 \cdot 8 \cdot 12}}{2 \cdot 8} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{7}}{2},\]so $\frac{-1-\sqrt{7}}{2} \le k \le \frac{-1 +\sqrt{7}}{2},$ and the maximum value of $k$ is $\boxed{\frac{-1+\sqrt7}{2}}.$
Note that $|\omega^3| = |\omega|^3 = 1,$ so $|\omega| = 1.$   Then $\omega \overline{\omega} = |\omega|^2 = 1.$
Also, $\omega^3 - 1 = 0,$ which factors as $(\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0.$  Since $\omega \neq 1,$
\[\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
|a + b \omega + c \omega^2|^2 &= (a + b \omega + c \omega^2)(a + b \overline{\omega} + c \overline{\omega^2}) \\
&= (a + b \omega + c \omega^2) \left( a + \frac{b}{\omega} + \frac{c}{\omega^2} \right) \\
&= (a + b \omega + c \omega^2)(a + b \omega^2 + c \omega) \\
&= a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + (\omega + \omega^2) ab + (\omega + \omega^2) ac + (\omega^2 + \omega^4) bc \\
&= a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + (\omega + \omega^2) ab + (\omega + \omega^2) ac + (\omega + \omega^2) bc \\
&= a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc \\
&= \frac{(a - b)^2 + (a - c)^2 + (b - c)^2}{2}.
\end{align*}Since $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are distinct, all three of $|a - b|,$ $|a - c|,$ and $|b - c|$ must be at least 1, and at least one of these absolute values must be at least 2, so
\[\frac{(a - b)^2 + (a - c)^2 + (b - c)^2}{2} \ge \frac{1 + 1 + 4}{2} = 3.\]Equality occurs when $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are any three consecutive integers, in any order, so the smallest possible value of $|a + b \omega + c \omega^2|$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{3}}.$
Consider a triangle $ABC$ where $a = b.$
unitsize (3 cm);
pair A, B, C;
A = (0,0);
B = (2,0);
C = (1,0.2);
draw(A--B--C--cycle);
label("$A$", A, W);
label("$B$", B, E);
label("$C$", C, N);
label("$a$", (B + C)/2, N);
label("$a$", (A + C)/2, N);
label("$c$", (A + B)/2, S);
[/asy]
As $\angle ACB$ approaches $180^\circ,$ $c$ approaches $2a,$ so $\frac{a^2 + b^2}{c^2}$ approaches $\frac{a^2 + a^2}{(2a)^2} = \frac{1}{2}.$  This means $M \le \frac{1}{2}.$
On the other hand, by the triangle inequality, $c < a + b,$ so
\[c^2 < (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\]By AM-GM, $2ab < a^2 + b^2,$ so
\[c^2 < 2a^2 + 2b^2.\]Hence,
\[\frac{a^2 + b^2}{c^2} > \frac{1}{2}.\]Therefore, the largest such constant $M$ is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
We can write the expression as
\begin{align*}
4x^2 - 6kxy + (3k^2 + 2) y^2 - 4x - 4y + 6 &= x^2 - 4x + 4 + 2y^2 - 4y + 2 + 3x^2 - 6kxy + 3k^2 y^2 \\
&= (x^2 - 4x + 4) + 2(y^2 - 2y + 1) + 3(x^2 - 2kxy + k^2 y^2) \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + 2(y - 1)^2 + 3(x - ky)^2.
\end{align*}The only way that this expression can take on the value of 0 is if $x = 2,$ $y = 1,$ and $x = ky.$  Thus, $k = \boxed{2}.$
Since $10, a, b$ is an arithmetic progression, we have $a = \frac12 (10+b)$
Also, we have $a+ab = 2b$, and so $a(1+b) = 2b$
Substituting the expression for $a$ gives $(10+b)(1+b) = 4b$
Solving this quadratic equation gives the solutions $b = -2$ and $b = -5$
The corresponding values for $a$ can be found by $a = \frac12 (10+b)$, giving solutions $(4,-2)$ $\left(\frac{5}{2},-5 \right),$ for a total of $\boxed{2}$ solutions.
Completing the square, we have $f(x)=2(x-1)^2-7$
The graph of this function is a parabola with its vertex at $x=1$
To the left of that point, $f(x)$ is decreasing; to the right, it's increasing
Thus, by restricting the domain to either $(-\infty,1]$ or $[1,\infty)$, we make $f$ invertible
The choice that includes $x=0$ is $\boxed{(-\infty,1]}$.
Let the first term be $a,$ and let the common ratio be $r.$  Then
\[a + ar + ar^2 + \dots + ar^{2010} = 200\]and
\[a + ar + ar^2 + \dots + ar^{4021} = 380.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[ar^{2011} + ar^{2012} + \dots + ar^{4021} = 180.\]Then
\[r^{2011} (a + ar + \dots + ar^{2010}) = 180,\]so
\[r^{2011} = \frac{180}{200} = \frac{9}{10}.\]Then the sum of the first 6033 terms is
\begin{align*}
a + ar + ar^2 + \dots + ar^{6032} &= (a + ar + ar^2 + \dots + ar^{4021}) + (ar^{4022} + ar^{4023} + \dots + ar^{6032}) \\
&= 380 + r^{4022} (a + ar + \dots + ar^{2010}) \\
&= 380 + \left( \frac{9}{10} \right)^2 \cdot 200 \\
&= \boxed{542}.
\end{align*}
The given equation can be factored as $$
0=8xy-12y+2x-3=4y(2x-3)+(2x-3)=(4y+1)(2x-3).
$$For this equation to be true for all values of $y$ we must have $2x-3=0$, that is,  $x=\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$.
By AM-GM,
\[2 \sqrt{x} + \frac{1}{x} = \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{x} + \frac{1}{x} \ge 3 \sqrt[3]{\sqrt{x} \cdot \sqrt{x} \cdot \frac{1}{x}} = 3.\]Equality occurs when $x = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{3}.$
We see that the endpoints of the major axis of the ellipse are $(0,-1)$ and $(6,-1)$, and the endpoints of the minor axis of the ellipse are $(3,1)$ and $(3,-3)$
Then, the center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the two axes, which is $(3,-1)$.
The lengths of the major and minor axis are $6$ and $4$, respectively, so the distance between the foci is $\sqrt{6^2-4^2} = 2\sqrt{5}.$ It follows that each focus is $\sqrt{5}$ away from the center, $(3,-1),$ along the major (horizontal) axis
Therefore, the focus with the larger $x$-coordinate must be $\boxed{(3+\sqrt{5},-1)}.$
Expanding $(\sqrt a-b)^3,$ we have \[\begin{aligned} (\sqrt a-b)^3 &= a\sqrt a - 3ab + 3b^2 \sqrt a - b^3 \\ &= (a+3b^2)\sqrt a + (-3ab-b^3)
\end{aligned}\]Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, we must have \[\begin{aligned} (a+3b^2) \sqrt a &= \sqrt{2700}, \\ -3ab-b^3 &= -37
\end{aligned}\]The second equation factors as $b(3a+b^2) = 37.$ Since $37$ is a prime, we must have $b=37$ or $b=1.$ If $b=37,$ then $3a+b^2=1,$ which has no positive integer solutions for $a.$ Therefore, $b=1,$ and we have $3a+b^2=37,$ which gives $a=12.$
Indeed, $(a,b)=(12,1)$ also satisfies the first equation: \[(a+3b^2)\sqrt a = (12+3 \cdot 1^2) \sqrt {12} = 15 \sqrt{12}= \sqrt{2700}.\]Therefore, $a+b = 12 + 1 = \boxed{13}.$
Let $t = \log_4 3.$ Then, $\log_4 27 = 3 \log_4 3 = 3t,$ and $\log_2 9 = \frac{\log_4 9}{\log_4 2} = \frac{2 \log_4 3}{1/2} = 4t.$ Therefore the triangle has its sides in the proportion $3:4:5,$ so $h = 5t = 5 \log_4 3 = \log_4 243.$ Thus, $4^h = \boxed{243}.$
From the formula for an infinite geometric series,
\[1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \dotsb = \frac{1}{1 + x}.\]Thus, we want to solve
\[x = \frac{1}{1 + x}.\]This simplifies to $x^2 + x - 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,
\[x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]The infinite geometric series
\[1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \dotsb\]converges only for $|x| < 1,$ so the only solution in $x$ is $\boxed{\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}.$
We start with the first equation
Any value of $x$ that makes the first equation true must also satisfy \[(x+a)(x+b)(x+12) = 0.\]Therefore, the only possible roots of the first equation are $-a,$ $-b,$ and $-12.$ Because the first equation has three distinct roots, it must be that $-a,$ $-b,$ and $-12$ are all distinct and all satisfy the first equation
This means that $-a,$ $-b,$ and $-12$ cannot equal $-3,$ since when $x=-3$ in the first equation, the denominator of the fraction becomes zero
In conclusion, from the first equation having $3$ distinct roots, we discern that all of the numbers $-a,$ $-b,$ $-12,$ and $-3$ are distinct
That is, all the numbers $a,$ $b,$ $3,$ and $12$ are distinct.
Then $-3$ is necessarily a root of the second equation, because when $x = -3,$ the numerator is zero, while the denominator is nonzero
Thus, $-3$ must be the only root of the second equation
In particular, neither $-2a$ nor $-6$ can be another distinct root of the equation, even though they are roots of the numerator.
Since $-6 \neq -3,$ it must be that $-6$ is not a root of the second equation at all, because it makes the denominator zero
Then we must have $-6 + b = 0,$ so $b = 6.$
For $-2a$ not to be another distinct root, we must either have $-2a = -3$ (so that $-2a$ is a root of the second equation, but it is equal to the other root, $-3$), or $x = -2a$ must make the denominator zero
The denominator is $(x+6)(x+12)=0,$ so either $-2a + 6 = 0$ or $-2a + 12 = 0,$ which means either $a = 3$ or $a = 6.$ But we know that $a,$ $b,$ $3,$ and $12$ are distinct, and $b=6,$ so this is impossible
Hence $-2a = -3,$ so $a = \tfrac{3}{2}.$
In conclusion, the two equations are \[\frac{(x+\tfrac32)(x+6)(x+12)}{(x+3)^2} = 0\]and \[\frac{(x+3)(x+3)(x+6)}{(x+6)(x+12)} = 0,\]which satisfy the conditions: the first equation has roots $x = -\tfrac32, -6, -12,$ while the second equation has only the one root $x = -3.$ Hence, \[100a + b = 100 \left(\tfrac32\right) + 6 = \boxed{156}.\]
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
x^2 + 8x + \frac{64}{x^3} &= x^2 + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + \frac{32}{x^3} + \frac{32}{x^3} \\
&\ge 7 \sqrt[7]{(x^2)(2x)(2x)(2x)(2x) \left( \frac{32}{x^3} \right) \left( \frac{32}{x^3} \right)} \\
&= 28.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x = 2,$ so the minimum value of $f(x)$ for $x > 0$ is $\boxed{28}.$
We can pair the terms as follows:
\[\left( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x + 14} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{x + 2} + \frac{1}{x + 12} \right) - \left( \frac{1}{x + 4} + \frac{1}{x + 10} \right) - \left( \frac{1}{x+ 6} + \frac{1}{x + 8} \right) = 0.\]Then
\[\frac{2x + 14}{x^2 + 14x} + \frac{2x + 14}{x^2 + 14x + 24} - \frac{2x + 14}{x^2 + 14x + 40} - \frac{2x + 14}{x^2 + 14x + 48} = 0.\]Dividing by 2, we get
\[\frac{x + 7}{x^2 + 14x} + \frac{x + 7}{x^2 + 14x + 24} - \frac{x + 7}{x^2 + 14x + 40} - \frac{x + 7}{x^2 + 14x + 48} = 0.\]Let $y = x + 7.$  Then
\[\frac{y}{y^2 - 49} + \frac{y}{y^2 - 25} - \frac{y}{y^2 - 9} - \frac{y}{y^2 - 1} = 0.\]We see that $y = 0$ is a solution
Otherwise, $y \neq 0,$ so we can divide both sides by $y$:
\[\frac{1}{y^2 - 49} + \frac{1}{y^2 - 25} - \frac{1}{y^2 - 9} - \frac{1}{y^2 - 1} = 0.\]Now, let $z = y^2,$ so
\[\frac{1}{z - 49} + \frac{1}{z - 25} - \frac{1}{z - 9} - \frac{1}{z - 1} = 0.\]Then
\[\frac{1}{z - 49} - \frac{1}{z - 9} = \frac{1}{z - 1} - \frac{1}{z - 25}.\]Combining the fractions on each side, we get
\[\frac{40}{(z - 49)(z - 9)} = -\frac{24}{(z - 1)(z - 25)}.\]Hence, $40(z - 1)(z - 25) = -24(z - 49)(z - 9).$  This simplifies to $z^2 - 38z + 181 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,
\[z = 19 \pm 6 \sqrt{5}.\]Then $y = \pm \sqrt{19 \pm 6 \sqrt{5}},$ and
\[x = -7 \pm \sqrt{19 \pm 6 \sqrt{5}}.\]Thus, $a + b + c + d = 7 + 19 + 6 + 5 = \boxed{37}.$
We take cases on the value of $x.$ If $x \le 1,$ then we have $(1-x) = (2-x) + (3-x),$ so $x = 4.$ But this does not satisfy $x<1,$ so it is not a valid solution.
If $1< x \le 2,$ then we have $x-1 = (2-x) + (3-x),$ so $x = 2,$ which is a valid solution.
If $2 < x \le 3,$ then we have $x-1 = (x-2) + (3-x),$ so $x=2$ again.
If $3 < x,$ then we have $(x-1) = (x-2) + (x-3),$ which gives $x=4.$ This time, $x=4$ is a valid solution because it satisfies $3 <x .$
Hence there are $\boxed{2}$ values of $x,$ namely $x=2$ and $x=4.$
Note that $x^6 - 3x^4 + 3x^2 - 1$ is very similar to $(x - 1)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1$
If we make the substitution $y = x^2$, our expression becomes $x^6 - 3x^4 + 3x^2 - 1 = y^3 - 3y^2 + 3y - 1 = (y - 1)^3$.
Now, we substitute $x^2$ back in for $y$: $(y - 1)^3 = (x^2 - 1)^3$
Note that $x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)$
Thus, our factorization is $x^6 - 3x^4 + 3x^2 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)^3 = ((x-1)(x+1))^3 = \boxed{(x-1)^3(x+1)^3}$.
By Vieta's formulas, the average of the sum of the roots is $\frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2},$ which corresponds to the center of the parallelogram
So, to shift the center of the parallelogram to the origin, let $w = z - \frac{3}{2}.$  Then $z = w + \frac{3}{2},$ so
\[\left( w + \frac{3}{2} \right)^4 - 6 \left( w + \frac{3}{2} \right)^3 + 11a \left( w + \frac{3}{2} \right)^2 - 3(2a^2 + 3a - 3) \left( w + \frac{3}{2} \right) + 1 = 0.\]Hence,
\[(2w + 3)^4 - 2 \cdot 6 (2w + 3)^3 + 4 \cdot 11a (2w + 3)^2 - 8 \cdot 3(2a^2 + 3a - 3)(2w + 3) + 16 = 0.\]Expanding, we get
\[16w^4 + (176a - 216) w^2 + (-96a^2 + 384a - 288) w - 144a^2 + 180a - 11 = 0.\]The roots of this equation will form a parallelogram centered at the origin, which means they are of the form $w_1,$ $-w_1,$ $w_2,$ $-w_2.$  Thus, we can also write the equation as
\[(w - w_1)(w + w_1)(w - w_2)(w + w_2) = (w^2 - w_1^2)(w^2 - w_2^2) = 0.\]Note that the coefficient of $w$ will be 0, so
\[-96a^2 + 384a - 288 = 0.\]This equation factors as $-96(a - 1)(a - 3) = 0,$ so $a = 1$ or $a = 3.$
For $a = 1,$ the equation becomes
\[16w^4 - 40w^2 + 25 = (4w^2 - 5)^2 = 0,\]which has two double roots.
For $a = 3,$ the given equation becomes
\[w^4 + 312w^2 - 767 = 0.\]The roots of $x^2 + 312x - 767 = 0$ are real, and one is positive and the other is negative
This mean that two of the roots of $w^4 + 312w^2 - 767 = 0$ are real (and negatives of each other), and the other two are imaginary (and negatives of each other), so they form a parallelogram.
Thus, the only such value of $a$ is $\boxed{3}.$
We know that if a polynomial with rational coefficients has an irrational number $a + \sqrt{b}$ as a root, then its radical conjugate, $a - \sqrt{b},$ must also be a root of the polynomial.
For all $n = 1, 2, \ldots, 1000,$ the number $n + \sqrt{n+1}$ is a root of the given polynomial, so we think that each root must have its corresponding conjugate root, which gives $2 \cdot 1000 = 2000$ roots in total
However, not all of the numbers $n + \sqrt{n+1}$ are irrational: when $n+1$ is a perfect square, the number is rational (in fact, an integer), so it has no associated radical conjugate.
There are $30$ values of $n$ for which $n+1$ is a perfect square, since $n+1$ can be any of the perfect squares $2^2, 3^2, \ldots, 31^2.$ Therefore, we adjust our initial count by $30,$ so that the polynomial must have at least $2000 - 30 = 1970$ roots
Since the number of roots of a polynomial is equal to its degree, the smallest possible degree of the given polynomial is $\boxed{1970}.$
Because the coefficients of the polynomial are rational, the radical conjugate $2-\sqrt{3}$ must also be a root of the polynomial
By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of this polynomial is $-10,$ and the product of these two roots is $(2+\sqrt3)(2-\sqrt3) = 1,$ so the remaining root must be $\frac{-10}{1} = -10.$ Then by Vieta's formulas again, we have \[b = (-10)(2-\sqrt3) + (-10)(2+\sqrt3) + (2+\sqrt3)(2-\sqrt3) = \boxed{-39}.\]
The other root is simply the negative of $3 + 8i,$ which is $\boxed{-3 - 8i}.$
We recognize that $64x^6-729y^6=(4x^2)^3-(9y^2)^3$, allowing us to first apply the difference of squares factorization, followed by the sum and difference of cubes factorizations: \begin{align*} 64x^6-729y^6&=(8x^3-27y^3)(8x^3+27y^3)
\\&=(2x-3y)(4x^2+6xy+9y^2)(2x+3y)(4x^2-6xy+9y^2)
\end{align*}The sum of all the coefficients is $2+(-3)+4+6+9+2+3+4+(-6)+9=\boxed{30}$.
Writing out the equation $f(f(x)) = x$, we have \[f\left(\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\right) = x \implies \frac{a \cdot \frac{ax+b}{cx+d} + b}{c \cdot \frac{ax+b}{cx+d} + d} = x \implies \frac{a(ax+b)+b(cx+d)}{c(ax+b)+d(cx+d)} = x\]or \[(a^2+bc)x + (ab+bd) = (ac+cd)x^2 + (bc+d^2)x.\]Since this equation holds for infinitely many distinct values of $x$, the corresponding coefficients must be equal
Thus, \[ab+bd = 0, \quad a^2+bc = bc+d^2, \quad ac+cd=0.\]Since $b$ and $c$ are nonzero, the first and last equations simplify to $a +d=0$, so $d=-a$, and then the second equation is automatically satisfied
Therefore, all we have from $f(f(x)) = x$ is $d=-a$
That is, \[f(x) = \frac{ax+b}{cx-a}.\]Now, using $f(19) = 19$ and $f(97) = 97$, we get \[19 = \frac{19a+b}{19c-a} \quad \text{and} \quad 97 = \frac{97a+b}{97c-a}.\]These equations become \[b = 19^2 c - 2\cdot 19 a = 97^2 c - 2 \cdot 97 a.\]At this point, we look at what we want to find: the unique number not in the range of $f$
To find this number, we try to find an expression for $f^{-1}(x)$
If $f(x) = \frac{ax+b}{cx+d}$, then $cxf(x) + df(x) = ax+b$, so $x(a-cf(x)) = df(x) - b$, and so $x = \frac{df(x)-b}{a-cf(x)}$
Thus, \[f^{-1}(x) = \frac{dx-b}{a-cx}.\]Since $x = a/c$ is not in the domain of $f^{-1}(x)$, we see that $a/c$ is not in the range of $f(x)$.
Now we can find $a/c$: we have \[19^2 c - 2 \cdot 19 a = 97^2 c - 2 \cdot 97 a,\]so \[2 \cdot(97-19) a = (97^2 - 19^2) c.\]Thus \[\frac{a}{c} = \frac{97^2-19^2}{2 \cdot (97-19)} = \frac{97+19}{2} = \boxed{58}\]by the difference of squares factorization.
We find
$$\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}=\frac{1}{n(n+1)}$$
So we want $\frac{1}{n(n+1)}<\frac{1}{10}$, or $n(n+1)>10$
We see that $2(3)=6<10$, while $3(4)=12>10$
So the least possible value is $\boxed{3}$.
Recall that a parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus $F$ and the directrix
To make the algebra a bit easier, we can find the focus of the parabola $y = 4x^2,$ and then shift it downward 3 units to find the focus of the parabola $y = 4x^2 - 3.$
Since the parabola $y = 4x^2$ is symmetric about the $y$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(0,f).$  Let $y = d$ be the equation of the directrix.

Let $(x,4x^2)$ be a point on the parabola $y = 4x^2.$  Then
\[PF^2 = x^2 + (4x^2 - f)^2\]and $PQ^2 = (4x^2 - d)^2.$  Thus,
\[x^2 + (4x^2 - f)^2 = (4x^2 - d)^2.\]Expanding, we get
\[x^2 + 16x^4 - 8fx^2 + f^2 = 16x^4 - 8dx^2 + d^2.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
1 - 8f &= -8d, \\
f^2 &= d^2.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $f - d = \frac{1}{8}.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $2f = \frac{1}{8},$ so $f = \frac{1}{16}.$
Thus, the focus of $y = 4x^2$ is $\left( 0, \frac{1}{16} \right),$ so the focus of $y = 4x^2 - 3$ is $\boxed{\left( 0, -\frac{47}{16} \right)}.$
Let $w = a - 1,$ $x = b - 1,$ $y = c - 1,$ and $z = d - 1.$  Then $a = w + 1,$ $b = x + 1,$ $c = y + 1$ and $d = z + 1,$ so
\[a + b + c + d = w + x + y + z + 4 = 6,\]which means $w + x + y + z = 2.$  Also,
\begin{align*}
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 &= (w + 1)^2 + (x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + (z + 1)^2 \\
&= w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(w + x + y + z) + 4 \\
&= 12,
\end{align*}so $w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 12 - 2(w + x + y + z) - 4 = 12 - 2(2) - 4 = 4.$
\begin{align*}
4 \sum a^3 - \sum a^4 &= \sum (4a^3 - a^4) \\
&= \sum a^3 (4 - a) \\
&= \sum (w + 1)^3 (3 - w) \\
&= \sum (-w^4 + 6w^2 + 8w + 3) \\
&= -\sum w^4 + 6 \sum w^2 + 8 \sum w + 12 \\
&= -(w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4) + 6 \cdot 4 + 8 \cdot 2 + 12 \\
&= 52 - (w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4).
\end{align*}First,
\[(w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 = 16.\]Expanding, we get
\[w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + 2(w^2 x^2 + w^2 y^2 + y^2 z^2 + x^2 y^2 + x^2 z^2 + y^2 z^2) = 16.\]Therefore, $w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4 \le 16.$  Equality occurs when $w = 2$ and $x = y = z = 0.$
Also, by Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(1 + 1 + 1 + 1)(w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4) \ge (w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2.\]Then $4(w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4) \ge 16,$ so $w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4 \ge 4.$  Equality occurs when $w = -1$ and $x = y = z = 1.$
Hence,
\[36 \le 4(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4) \le 48.\]The minimum occurs when $(a,b,c,d) = (1,1,1,3),$ and the maximum occurs when $(a,b,c,d) = (0,2,2,2).$  Thus, $m = 36$ and $M = 48,$ so $m + M = \boxed{84}.$
Let $s=x+y$ and $p=xy$
Then the first equation reads $s+p=71$, and the second equation reads \[x^2y+xy^2=(x+y)xy = sp = 880.\]Therefore $s$ and $p$ are the roots of \[t^2 - 71t+ 880 = 0.\]This factors as \[(t-16)(t-55) = 0,\]so $s$ and $p$ are the numbers $16$ and $55$ in some order
If $s = 16$ and $p = 55$, then \[x^2+y^2 = (x+y)^2 - 2xy = s^2 - 2p = 16^2 -2 \cdot 55 =146.\]If $s = 55$ and $p = 16$, then from $x+y=55$, we see that $p = xy \ge 1 \cdot 54 = 54$, which is a contradiction
Therefore the answer is $\boxed{146}$.
We label the terms $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_{2009},x_{2010}$.
Suppose that $S$ is the sum of the odd-numbered terms in the sequence; that is, \[ S = x_1 + x_3 + x_5 + \cdots + x_{2007}+x_{2009} \]We know that the sum of all of the terms is 5307; that is, \[ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \cdots + x_{2009}+x_{2010} = 5307 \]Next, we pair up the terms: each odd-numbered term with the following even-numbered term
That is, we pair the first term with the second, the third term with the fourth, and so on, until we pair the 2009th term with the 2010th term
There are 1005 such pairs.
In each pair, the even-numbered term is one bigger than the odd-numbered term
That is, $x_2-x_1=1$, $x_4-x_3=1$, and so on
Therefore, the sum of the even-numbered terms is 1005 greater than the sum of the odd-numbered terms
Thus, the sum of the even-numbered terms is $S+1005$.
Since the sum of all of the terms equals the sum of the odd-numbered terms plus the sum of the even-numbered terms, then $S+(S+1005)=5307$ or $2S=4302$ or $S=2151$
Thus, the required sum is $\boxed{2151}$.
The parabola $y = ax^2 + 6$ is tangent to the line $y = x$ when the equation
\[ax^2 + 6 = x\]has a double root (which is the $x$-coordinate of the point of tangency)
From this equation,
\[ax^2 - x + 6 = 0.\]This quadratic has a double root when the discriminant is 0, which gives us $1 - 24a = 0.$  Hence, $a = \boxed{\frac{1}{24}}.$
Solving for $a,$ we find
\[a = \frac{-x^4 + x^2 - 1}{x^3 + x} = -\frac{x^4 - x^2 + 1}{x^3 + x} = -\frac{x^2 - 1 + \frac{1}{x^2}}{x + \frac{1}{x}}.\]Let $u = x + \frac{1}{x}.$  Then $u^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2},$ so
\[a = -\frac{u^2 - 3}{u}.\]If $x$ is positive, then by AM-GM, $u = x + \frac{1}{x} \ge 2.$  Also,
\[a + \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{2u^2 - u - 6}{u} = -\frac{(u - 2)(2u + 3)}{u} \le 0,\]so $a \le -\frac{1}{2}.$
Furthermore, if $2 \le u \le v,$ then
\begin{align*}
-\frac{v^2 - 3}{v} + \frac{u^2 - 3}{u} &= \frac{-uv^2 + 3u + u^2 v - 3v}{uv} \\
&= \frac{(u - v)(uv + 3)}{uv} \le 0,
\end{align*}which shows that $a = -\frac{u^2 - 3}{u} = -u + \frac{3}{u}$ is decreasing on $[2,\infty).$  As $u$ goes to $\infty,$ $-u + \frac{3}{u}$ goes to $-\infty.$  (Note that $u = x + \frac{1}{x}$ can take on any value that is greater than or equal to 2.)
Similarly, we can show that if $x$ is negative, then
\[a = \frac{-x^2 + x^2 - 1}{x^3 + x} \ge \frac{1}{2},\]and that $a$ can take on all values greater than or equal to $\frac{1}{2}.$
Hence, the possible values of $a$ are
\[a \in \boxed{\left( -\infty, -\frac{1}{2} \right] \cup \left[ \frac{1}{2}, \infty \right)}.\]
We can write
\[\frac{1}{x^{2^n} - x^{-2^n}} = \frac{x^{2^n}}{x^{2^{n + 1}} - 1}.\]Let $y = x^{2^n}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^{2^n}}{x^{2^{n + 1}} - 1} &= \frac{y}{y^2 - 1} \\
&= \frac{(y + 1) - 1}{y^2 - 1} \\
&= \frac{y + 1}{y^2 - 1} - \frac{1}{y^2 - 1} \\
&= \frac{1}{y - 1} - \frac{1}{y^2 - 1} \\
&= \frac{1}{x^{2^n} - 1} - \frac{1}{x^{2^{n + 1}} - 1}.
\end{align*}Thus, the sum telescopes:
\[\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{x^{2^n} - x^{-2^n}} = \left( \frac{1}{x - 1} - \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} - \frac{1}{x^4 - 1} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{x^4 - 1} - \frac{1}{x^8 - 1} \right) + \dotsb = \boxed{\frac{1}{x - 1}}.\]
We will consider the sum $A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H$
We know that the sum of any three consecutive terms is $30$ and that $C=5$, so $A+B+C=A+B+5=30$ and thus $A+B=25$
Now, we have
\[A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H=A+(B+C+D)+(E+F+G)+H=A+30+30+H=A+H+60\]and
\[A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H=(A+B)+(C+D+E)+(F+G+H)=25+30+30=85.\]Equating the two values we obtained for the sum, we find that $A+H+60=85$, so $A+H=\boxed{25}$.
Let $u = x^2 + 2y^2.$  By AM-GM,
\[u = x^2 + 2y^2 \ge 2 \sqrt{x^2 \cdot 2y^2} = 2xy \sqrt{2},\]so $xy \le \frac{u}{2 \sqrt{2}}.$
Let $xy = ku,$ so $k \le \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}}.$  Then from the equation $x^2 - xy + 2y^2,$
\[u(1 - k) = 8,\]and
\[x^2 + xy + 2y^2 = u(1 + k) = 8 \cdot \frac{1 + k}{1 - k}.\]This is an increasing function of $k$ for $k < 1,$ so it is maximized at $k = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}}.$  Hence, the maximum value of $x^2 + xy + 2y^2$ is
\[8 \cdot \frac{1 + \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}}}{1 - \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}}} = \frac{72 + 32 \sqrt{2}}{7}.\]The final answer is $72 + 32 + 2 + 7 = \boxed{113}.$
From the equation $x + \frac{1}{x} = 5,$ $x^2 + 1 = 5x,$ so
\[x^2 = 5x - 1.\]Then
\[(x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 = (5x - 1) - 4x + 4 = x + 3.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
(x - 2)^2 + \frac{25}{(x - 2)^2} &= x + 3 + \frac{25}{x + 3} \\
&= \frac{(x + 3)^2 + 25}{x + 3} \\
&= \frac{x^2 + 6x + 9 + 25}{x + 3} \\
&= \frac{(5x - 1) + 6x + 34}{x + 3} \\
&= \frac{11x + 33}{x + 3} \\
&= \boxed{11}.
\end{align*}
Taking $x = 0$ and $y = 10,$ we get
\[f(0) = f(0) f(10).\]Since $f(0) \neq 0,$ we can divide both sides by $f(0),$ to get $f(10) = \boxed{1}.$
Simplifying each term in the product, we have \[\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) \dotsm \left( \frac{98}{99} \right) \left( \frac{99}{100} \right)
\]The denominator of each fraction cancels with the numerator of the next fraction, so the product is $\boxed{\frac{1}{100}}.$
From the given equations,
\begin{align*}
a - b &= \frac{1}{c} - \frac{1}{b}  =\frac{b - c}{bc}, \\
b - c &= \frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{c} = \frac{c - a}{ac}, \\
c - a &= \frac{1}{b} - \frac{1}{a} = \frac{a - b}{ab}.
\end{align*}Multiplying these equations, we get
\[(a - b)(b - c)(c - a) = \frac{(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)}{a^2 b^2 c^2}.\]Since $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are distinct, we can cancel the factors of $a - b,$ $b - c,$ $c - a,$ to get
\[a^2 b^2 c^2 = 1.\]Therefore, $|abc| = \boxed{1}.$
Using the given $f(3x) = 3f(x)$ repeatedly, we have that \[f(2001) = 3f\left(\frac{2001}{3}\right) = 3^2f\left(\frac{2001}{3^2}\right) = \dots = 3^6f\left(\frac{2001}{3^6}\right).\]Since $1 \le 2001/3^6 \le 3,$ we can apply the second part of the definition of $f$ to get \[f(2001) = 3^6\left(1 - \left|\frac{2001}{3^6} - 2\right|\right) = 3 \cdot 3^6 - 2001 = 186.\]Therefore, we want the smallest $x$ for which $f(x) = 186.$ Note that the range of $f(x) $ in the interval $x \in [1, 3]$ is $[0, 1].$ Since $f(3x) = 3f(x)$ for all $x,$ it follows that the range of $f(x)$ in the interval $x \in [3, 9]$ is $[0,3].$ Similarly, for each $k,$ the range of $f(x)$ in the interval $x \in [3^k, 3^{k+1}]$ is $[0, 3^k].$ Therefore, if $f(x) = 186,$ then $3^k \ge 186,$ so $k \ge 5.$
We search the interval $x \in [3^5, 3^6] = [243, 729].$ We want $f(x) = 186,$ and for any $x$ in this interval, we have $f(x) = 3^5f\left(\frac{x}{3^5}\right).$ Therefore, letting $y = \frac{x}{3^5},$ we want $f(y) = \frac{186}{3^5} = \frac{186}{243},$ where $y \in [1, 3].$ That is, \[1 - |y-2| = \frac{186}{243} \implies |y-2| = \frac{57}{243}.\]The smaller of the two solutions to this equation is $y = 2 - \frac{57}{243} = \frac{429}{243}.$ Thus, $x = 3^5y = \boxed{429}.$
Let $d$ be the degree of $P(x).$  Then the degree of $P(P(x))$ is $d^2,$ and the degree of $(x^2 + x + 1) P(x)$ is $d + 2,$ so
\[d^2 = d + 2.\]Then $d^2 - d - 2 = (d - 2)(d + 1) = 0.$  Since $d$ is positive, $d = 2.$
Let $P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.$  Then
\begin{align*}
P(P(x)) &= a(ax^2 + bx + c)^2 + b(ax^2 + bx + c) + c \\
&= a^3 x^4 + 2a^2 bx^3 + (ab^2 + 2a^2 c + ab) x^2 + (2abc + b^2) x + ac^2 + bc + c
\end{align*}and
\[(x^2 + x + 1)(ax^2 + bx + c) = ax^4 + (a + b) x^3 + (a + b + c) x^2 + (b + c) x + c.\]Comparing coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
a^3 &= a, \\
2a^2 b &= a + b, \\
ab^2 + 2a^2 c + ab &= a + b + c, \\
2abc + b^2 &= b + c, \\
ac^2 + bc + c &= c.
\end{align*}From $a^3 = a,$ $a^3 - a = a(a - 1)(a + 1) = 0,$ so $a$ is 0, 1, or $-1.$  But $a$ is the leading coefficient, so $a$ cannot be 0, which means $a$ is 1 or $-1.$
If $a = 1,$ then $2b = 1 + b,$ so $b = 1.$  Then
\[1 + 2c + 1 = 1 + 1 + c,\]so $c = 0.$  Note that $(a,b,c) = (1,1,0)$ satisfies all the equations.
If $a = -1,$ then $2b = -1 + b,$ so $b = -1.$  Then
\[-1 + 2c + 1 = -1 - 1 + c,\]so $c = -2.$  But then the equation $ac^2 + bc + c = c$ is not satisfied.
Hence, $(a,b,c) = (1,1,0),$ and $P(x) = \boxed{x^2 + x}.$
Factoring on the left side gives \[ \frac{-9x}{(x+1)(x-1)} = \frac{2x}{x+1} - \frac{6}{x-1} \]Then, we multiply both sides of the equation by $(x+1)(x-1)$, which gives \[-9x = 2x(x-1)-6(x+1).\]This equation simplifies to $2x^2 + x - 6 = 0$
We can factor this equation as $(x + 2)(2x-3) = 0$ so that $x = -2$ and $x = \frac{3}{2}$
We check that they are not -1 or 1, which are excluded from the domain, and they aren't
The sum of the solutions is $\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}$.
By AM-GM,
\[\frac{a_k + k}{2} \ge \sqrt{ka_k}\]for $1 \le k \le 6,$ so
\begin{align*}
\frac{a_1 + 1}{2} \cdot \frac{a_2 + 2}{2} \cdot \frac{a_3 + 3}{2} \cdot \frac{a_4 + 4}{2} \cdot \frac{a_5 + 5}{2} \cdot \frac{a_6 + 6}{2} &\ge \sqrt{a_1} \cdot \sqrt{2a_2} \cdot \sqrt{3a_3} \cdot \sqrt{4a_4} \cdot \sqrt{5a_5} \cdot \sqrt{6a_6} \\
&= \sqrt{6! a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5 a_6} \\
&= 6!.
\end{align*}Equality occurs if and only if $a_k = k$ for all $1 \le k \le 6.$  Thus, all $6! = 720$ permutations satisfy the inequality
\[\frac{a_1 + 1}{2} \cdot \frac{a_2 + 2}{2} \cdot \frac{a_3 + 3}{2} \cdot \frac{a_4 + 4}{2} \cdot \frac{a_5 + 5}{2} \cdot \frac{a_6 + 6}{2} > 6!,\]except for the permutation where $a_k = k$ for all $1 \le k \le 6,$ giving us $720 - 1 = \boxed{719}$ possible permutations.
Let $t = x + \sqrt{x^2 + b^2}.$  Then $t - x = \sqrt{x^2 + b^2},$ so
\[(t - x)^2 = x^2 + b^2.\]Expanding, we get
\[t^2 - 2tx + x^2 = x^2 + b^2,\]so
\[x = \frac{t^2 - b^2}{2t}.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
2(a - x)(x + \sqrt{x^2 + b^2}) &= 2 \left( a - \frac{t^2 - b^2}{2t} \right) t \\
&= 2at - t^2 + b^2 \\
&= a^2 + b^2 - (t - a)^2 \\
&\le a^2 + b^2.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $t = a$ or $x = \frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a},$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{a^2 + b^2}.$
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$
From the given property,
\begin{align*}
f(2002) &= 11^2 - f(46), \\
f(46) &= 6^2 - f(18), \\
f(18) &= 5^2 - f(14), \\
f(14) &= 4^2 - f(2).
\end{align*}Also, $f(2) + f(2) = 4,$ so $f(2) = 2.$  Hence,
\begin{align*}
f(14) &= 4^2 - 2 = 14, \\
f(18) &= 5^2 - 14 = 11, \\
f(46) &= 6^2 - 11 = 25, \\
f(2002) &= 11^2 - 25 = \boxed{96}.
\end{align*}
Write the equation of the original parabola as $y = a(x - h)^2 + k,$ where $a \neq 0.$  Then the equation of the reflected parabola is
\[y = -a(x - h)^2 - k.\]When the parabolas are translated horizontally by 5 units, in opposite directions, their equations become
\[y = a(x - h \pm 5)^2 + k \quad \text{and} \quad y = -a(x - h \mp 5)^2 - k.\]The sum of these expressions is
\[\pm 20ax \mp 20ah = \pm 20a (x - h),\]which is the equation of a non-horizontal line
The answer is $\boxed{\text{(D)}}.$
By AM-HM,
\[\frac{a + b}{2} \ge \frac{2}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}} = \frac{2ab}{a + b},\]so
\[\frac{ab}{a + b} \le \frac{a + b}{4}.\]Similarly,
\begin{align*}
\frac{ac}{a + c} \le \frac{a + c}{4}, \\
\frac{bc}{b + c} \le \frac{b + c}{4}.
\end{align*}Hence,
\[\frac{ab}{a + b} + \frac{ac}{a + c} + \frac{bc}{b + c} \le \frac{a + b}{4} + \frac{a + c}{4} + \frac{b + c}{4} = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.\]Equality occurs when $a = b = c = \frac{1}{3},$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
Note that $0 < L(x) < x$ for $0 < x < 2.$  Assuming $n$ is sufficiently large, i.e
$n \ge 9,$ we have that $0 < a_n < \frac{17}{n} < 2.$
From $L(x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2},$ we can write
\[\frac{1}{L(x)} = \frac{1}{x - \frac{x^2}{2}} = \frac{2}{2x - x^2} = \frac{2}{x(2 - x)} = \frac{x + (2 - x)}{x(2 - x)} = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{2 - x},\]so
\[\frac{1}{L(x)} - \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{2 - x} \quad (*).\]For a nonnegative integer $k,$ let $L^{(k)}(x)$ denote the $k$th iterate of $L(x).$  Then $0 < L^{(k)}(x) < x,$ so
\[0 < L^{(k)} \left( \frac{17}{n} \right) \le \frac{17}{n}.\]Hence,
\[\frac{1}{2} < \frac{1}{2 - L^{(k)} (\frac{17}{n})} \le \frac{1}{2 - \frac{17}{n}} = \frac{n}{2n - 17}.\]By equation $(*),$
\[\frac{1}{L^{(k + 1)} (\frac{17}{n})} - \frac{1}{L^{(k)} (\frac{17}{n})} = \frac{1}{2 - L^{(k)} (\frac{17}{n})},\]so
\[\frac{1}{2} < \frac{1}{L^{(k + 1)} (\frac{17}{n})} - \frac{1}{L^{(k)} (\frac{17}{n})} \le \frac{n}{2n - 17}.\]Summing over $0 \le k \le n - 1,$ we get
\[\frac{n}{2} < \frac{1}{L^{(n)} (\frac{17}{n})} - \frac{1}{\frac{17}{n}} \le \frac{n^2}{2n - 17}.\]Since $a_n = L^{(n)} \left( \frac{17}{n} \right),$ this becomes
\[\frac{n}{2} < \frac{1}{a_n} - \frac{n}{17} \le \frac{n^2}{2n - 17}.\]Dividing by $n,$ we get
\[\frac{1}{2} < \frac{1}{na_n} - \frac{1}{17} \le \frac{n}{2n - 17}.\]As $n$ approaches infinity, $\frac{n}{2n - 17}$ approaches $\frac{1}{2},$ so if $L$ is the limit of $na_n,$ then
\[\frac{1}{L} - \frac{1}{17} = \frac{1}{2}.\]Solving, we find $L = \boxed{\frac{34}{19}}.$
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(a + 2b) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} \right) \ge (1 + \sqrt{2})^2 = 3 + 2 \sqrt{2}.\]For equality to occur, we must have $a^2 = 2b^2,$ or $a = b \sqrt{2}.$  Then $b \sqrt{2} + 2b = 1,$ or
\[b = \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{(2 + \sqrt{2})(2 - \sqrt{2})} = \frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2},\]and $a = b \sqrt{2} = \frac{2 \sqrt{2} - 2}{2} = \sqrt{2} - 1.$
Hence, the minimum value is $\boxed{3 + 2 \sqrt{2}}.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
x^8 - 98x^4 + 1 &= (x^8 + 2x^4 + 1) - 100x^4 \\
&= (x^4 + 1)^2 - (10x^2)^2 \\
&= (x^4 + 10x^2 + 1)(x^4 - 10x^2 + 1).
\end{align*}Setting $x = 1$ in each factor, the final answer is $(1 + 10 + 1) + (1 - 10 + 1) = \boxed{4}.$
We take cases on the sign of $60-2x.$ If $60-2x \ge 0,$ then the equation becomes \[x = \left| 2x - (60-2x) \right| = \left| 4x - 60 \right|.\]Therefore, either $x = 4x-60,$ which gives $x=20,$ or $x=-(4x-60),$ which gives $x=12.$ Both solutions satisfy $60-2x \ge 0,$ so they are valid.
If $60-2x<0,$ then the equation becomes \[x = \left| 2x + (60-2x) \right| = 60,\]which satisfies $60-2x<0,$ so $x=60$ is the only solution in this case.
The sum of all the solutions is therefore $12 + 20 + 60 = \boxed{92}.$
Expanding $(2 - 7i)(a + bi),$ we get
\[2a - 7ai + 2bi - 7bi^2 = 2a - 7ai + 2bi + 7b.\]Since this number is pure imaginary, the real part $2a + 7b$ is equal to 0
Hence, $\frac{a}{b} = \boxed{-\frac{7}{2}}.$
Let the third root be $s.$  Then
\[8x^3 - 4x^2 - 42x + 45 = 8(x - r)^2 (x - s) = 8x^3 - 8(2r + s) x^2 + 8(r^2 + 2rs) x - 8r^2 s.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
2r + s &= \frac{1}{2}, \\
r^2 + 2rs &= -\frac{21}{4}, \\
r^2 s &= -\frac{45}{8}.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $s = \frac{1}{2} - 2r.$  Substituting into the second equation, we get
\[r^2 + 2r \left( \frac{1}{2} - 2r \right) = -\frac{21}{4}.\]This simplifies to $12r^2 - 4r - 21 = 0,$ which factors as $(2r - 3)(6r + 7) = 0.$  Thus, $r = \frac{3}{2}$ or $r = -\frac{7}{6}.$
If $r = \frac{3}{2},$ then $s = -\frac{5}{2}.$  If $r = -\frac{7}{6},$ then $s = \frac{17}{6}.$  We can check that only $r = \boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$ and $s = -\frac{5}{2}$ satisfy $r^2 s = -\frac{45}{8}.$
Completing the square on $x^2 + y^2 - 12x + 31 = 0,$ we get
\[(x - 6)^2 + y^2 = 5.\]Thus, the center of the circle is $(6,0),$ and its radius is $\sqrt{5}.$
Note that the parabola $y^2 = 4x$ opens to the right
Let $2t$ be the $y$-coordinate of $B.$  Then
\[x = \frac{y^2}{4} = \frac{(2t)^2}{4} = t^2,\]so $B = (t^2,2t).$
Let $C = (6,0),$ the center of the circle.
unitsize(0.6 cm);
real upperparab (real x) {
return (sqrt(4*x));
real lowerparab (real x) {
return (-sqrt(4*x));
pair A, B, C;
C = (6,0);
A = C + sqrt(5)*dir(140);
B = (5,upperparab(5));
draw(Circle(C,sqrt(5)));
draw(graph(upperparab,0,8));
draw(graph(lowerparab,0,8));
draw(A--B--C--cycle);
dot("$A$", A, NW);
dot("$B$", B, N);
dot("$C$", C, S);
[/asy]
By the Triangle Inequality, $AB + AC \ge BC,$ so
\[AB \ge BC - AC.\]Since $A$ is a point on the circle, $AC = \sqrt{5},$ so
\[AB \ge BC - \sqrt{5}.\]So, we try to minimize $BC.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
BC^2 &= (t^2 - 6)^2 + (2t)^2 \\
&= t^4 - 12t^2 + 36 + 4t^2 \\
&= t^4 - 8t^2 + 36 \\
&= (t^2 - 4)^2 + 20 \\
&\ge 20,
\end{align*}so $BC \ge \sqrt{20} = 2 \sqrt{5}.$  Then $AB \ge 2 \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} = \sqrt{5}.$
Equality occurs when $A = (5,2)$ and $B = (4,4),$ so the smallest possible distance $AB$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{5}}.$
To find the distance between two complex numbers, we find the magnitude of their difference
We calculate $(1+2i)-(-1+i)$ to be $2+i$
Now, $|2+i|=\sqrt{2^2+1^2}=\sqrt{5}$, thus the distance between the points is $\boxed{\sqrt{5}}$.
Clearing the fractions, we get
\begin{align*}
1 &= A(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)(x + 4) \\
&\quad + Bx(x + 2)(x + 3)(x + 4) \\
&\quad + Cx(x + 1)(x + 3)(x + 4) \\
&\quad + Dx(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 4) \\
&\quad + Ex(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3).
\end{align*}We can use the usual technique of solving for each constant
Or, we can recognize that both sides represent the same polynomial, which means that the polynomial on the right must simplify to 1
Furthermore, $A + B + C + D + E$ is the coefficient of $x^4$ on the right-hand side, so $A + B + C + D + E = \boxed{0}.$
First, we can factor the denominator:
\[1 + 2^n + 2^{n + 1} + 2^{2n + 1} = (1 + 2^n) + 2^{n + 1} (1 + 2^n) = (1 + 2^n)(1 + 2^{n + 1}).\]Then we can write the numerator $2^n$ as $(1 + 2^{n + 1}) - (1 + 2^n) = 2^n,$ so
\[\frac{2^n}{1 + 2^n + 2^{n + 1} + 2^{2n + 1}} = \frac{(1 + 2^{n + 1}) - (1 + 2^n)}{(1 + 2^n)(1 + 2^{n + 1})} = \frac{1}{1 + 2^n} - \frac{1}{1 + 2^{n + 1}}.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{2^n}{1 + 2^n + 2^{n + 1} + 2^{2n + 1}} &= \left( \frac{1}{1 + 2} - \frac{1}{1 + 2^2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{1 + 2^2} - \frac{1}{1 + 2^3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{1 + 2^3} - \frac{1}{1 + 2^4} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}.
\end{align*}
Since $p(x)$ is a factor of both $x^4 + 6x^2 + 25$ and $3x^4 + 4x^2 + 28x + 5,$ then it must be factor of
\[3(x^4 + 6x^2 + 25) - (3x^4 + 4x^2 + 28x + 5) = 14x^2 - 28x + 70 = 14(x^2 - 2x + 5).\]Hence, $p(x) = x^2 - 2x + 5,$ and $p(1) = 1 - 2 + 5 = \boxed{4}.$
We see that $f(n) = n + 10$ for $n = 1,$ 2, 3, $\dots,$ 9
\begin{align*}
f(10) &= f(5) = 15, \\
f(11) &= f(6) = 16, \\
f(12) &= f(7) = 17, \\
f(13) &= f(8) = 18, \\
f(14) &= f(9) = 19, \\
f(15) &= f(10) = 15,
\end{align*}and so on
At this point, the function becomes periodic, with period 5
Therefore, the maximum value of the function is $\boxed{19}.$
Multiplying through by $14xy$, we have $14y + 7x = 2xy$, so $2xy - 7x - 14y = 0$
We then apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by adding $49$ to both sides to get $2xy - 7x - 14y + 49 = 49$
We can then factor this to get $$(x-7)(2y-7) = 49$$Since $49$ factors to $7 \cdot 7$ and $x$ and $y$ must be positive integers, the only possible solutions $(x,y)$ are $(8, 28), (14,7), \text{and } (56,4)$
Out of these, $(14,7)$ yields the least possible value $xy$ of $\boxed{98}$.
The graph of $y = f \left( \frac{1 - x}{2} \right)$ is produced by taking the graph of $y = f(x)$ and reflecting it in the $y$-axis, then stretching it horizontally by a factor of 2, then shifting it to the right by one unit
The correct graph is $\boxed{\text{B}}.$
Since $2x+7$ is a factor, we should get a remainder of $0$ when we divide $6x^3+19x^2+cx+35$.
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{3x^2} & -x&+5  \\
\cline{2-5}
2x+7 & 6x^3&+19x^2&+cx&+35 \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{-6x^3} & -21x^2  \\
\cline{2-3}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{0} & -2x^2 & +cx  \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & +2x^2 & +7x \\
\cline{3-4}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 0 & (c+7)x & + 35 \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & -10x & -35 \\
\cline{4-5}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & (c+7-10)x & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]The remainder is $0$ if $c+7-10=0$, so $c=\boxed{3}$.
We can write the given equations as
\begin{align*}
\log_{10} (A^2 ML) &= 2, \\
\log_{10} (RM^2 L) &= 3, \\
\log_{10} (AR^2 L) &= 4.
\end{align*}Then $A^2 ML = 10^2,$ $RM^2 L = 10^3,$ and $AR^2 L = 10^4.$  Multiplying these equations, we get $A^3 R^3 M^3 L^3 = 10^9,$ so $ARML = 10^3 = \boxed{1000}.$
Setting $x = 79$ and $y = 1,$ we get
\[f(79) = 79f(1) = 79 \cdot 25 = \boxed{1975}.\]
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
x + y + z &= \frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{3} + \frac{y}{2} + \frac{y}{2} + z \\
&\ge 6 \sqrt[6]{\frac{x^3 y^2 z}{108}}.
\end{align*}Since $x + y + z = 1,$ this gives us
\[x^3 y^2 z \le \frac{108}{6^6} = \frac{1}{432}.\]Equality occurs when $\frac{x}{3} = \frac{y}{2} = z.$  Along with the condition $x + y + z = 1,$ we can solve to get $x = \frac{1}{2},$ $y = \frac{1}{3},$ and $z = \frac{1}{6},$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{1}{432}}.$
We note that \[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x + 4 = (x^2 - 2x - 8) \cdot x + 4 = 0 \cdot x + 4, \]since $x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0$
Now, $0 \cdot x + 4= \boxed{4}$, so this is our answer.
We could also solve for $x$ from the information given
The expression $x^2 - 2x - 8$ factors as $(x + 2)(x-4)$
Thus $x$ must be equal to 4 or $-2$
Since $x$ is positive, $x$ must equal 4
Thus our expression is equal to \[ 4^3 - 2 \cdot 4^2 - 8 \cdot 4 + 4
\]We can factor out a 4 to find that this is \[
4( 4^2 - 2 \cdot 4 - 8 + 1) = 4( 16 - 8 - 8 +1) = 4 \cdot 1 = 4, \]as before.
(Alternatively, since the problem statement implies that there is only one positive value of $x$ such that $x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0$, we could find the value 4 by trial and error, and then simplify as above.)
Substituting and expanding, we get
\begin{align*}
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz &= \left( \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{b} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{a}{c} + \frac{c}{a} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{b} \right) \left( \frac{a}{c} + \frac{c}{a} \right) \left( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} \right) \\
&= \frac{b^2}{c^2} + 2 + \frac{c^2}{b^2} + \frac{a^2}{c^2} + 2 + \frac{c^2}{a^2} + \frac{a^2}{b^2} + 2 + \frac{b^2}{a^2} - \left( \frac{a^2}{c^2} + \frac{b^2}{c^2} + 1 + \frac{b^2}{a^2} + \frac{a^2}{b^2} + 1 + \frac{c^2}{b^2} + \frac{c^2}{a^2} \right) \\
&= \boxed{4}.
\end{align*}
We can expand, to get
\[a(b - c)^3 + b(c - a)^3 + c(a - b)^3 = -a^3 b + ab^3 - b^3 c + bc^3 + a^3 c - ac^3.\]First, we take out a factor of $a - b$:
\begin{align*}
-a^3 b + ab^3 - b^3 c + bc^3 + a^3 c - ac^3 &= ab(b^2 - a^2) + (a^3 - b^3) c + (b - a) c^3 \\
&= ab(b - a)(b + a) + (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) c + (b - a) c^3 \\
&= (a - b)(-ab(a + b) + (a^2 + ab + b^2) c - c^3) \\
&= (a - b)(-a^2 b + a^2 c - ab^2 + abc + b^2 c - c^3).
\end{align*}We can then take out a factor of $b - c$:
\begin{align*}
-a^2 b + a^2 c - ab^2 + abc + b^2 c - c^3 &= a^2 (c - b) + ab(c - b) + c(b^2 - c^2) \\
&= a^2 (c - b) + ab(c - b) + c(b + c)(b - c) \\
&= (b - c)(-a^2 - ab + c(b + c)) \\
&= (b - c)(-a^2 - ab + bc + c^2).
\end{align*}Finally, we take out a factor of $c - a$:
\begin{align*}
-a^2 - ab + bc + c^2 &= (c^2 - a^2) + b(c - a) \\
&= (c + a)(c - a) + b(c - a) \\
&= (c - a)(a + b + c).
\end{align*}Thus, $p(a,b,c) = \boxed{a + b + c}.$
Setting $x=0$ in both equations, we get \[2013 = 3h^2 + j \quad \text{and} \quad 2014 = 2h^2 + k.\]Solving for $j$ and $k,$ we can rewrite the given equations as \[y = 3(x-h)^2 + (2013-3h^2) \quad \text{and} \quad y = 2(x-h)^2 + (2014-2h^2),\]or \[y = 3x^2 - 6xh + 2013 = 3(x^2-2hx+671) \quad \text{ and } \quad y = 2x^2 - 4hx + 2014 = 2(x^2 - 2hx + 1007).\]The left equation has positive integer roots, which must multiply to $671$ and sum to $2h.$ Similarly, the right equation has positive integer roots, which must multiply to $1007$ and sum to $2h.$ Since $671 = 61 \cdot 11$ and $1007 = 19 \cdot 53,$ we see that \[2h = 61 + 11 = 19 + 53 = 72,\]so $h = \boxed{36}.$
The horizontal asymptote of $f$ is the horizontal line that $f$ approaches as $x \to \pm \infty$
When the leading terms of the numerator and denominator have the same degree, that line is at the value equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients, namely $y = 2/1 = 2$
Setting this equal to $f(x)$, $$f(x) = 2 = \frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}.$$Clearing the denominator, $$2(x^2 - 4x + 1) = 2x^2 - 8x + 2 = 2x^2 - 5x - 7 \Longrightarrow 3x = 9 \Longrightarrow x = \boxed{3}.$$
We simplify the desired expression \[
\left | \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{w} \right| = \left | \frac{w+z}{wz} \right|.
\]Now, using the fact that $|ab| = |a|\cdot |b|$ and $|a/b| = |a|/|b|$, we substitute in the values for the magnitudes given in the problem: \[
\left | \frac{w+z}{wz} \right| = \frac{|w+z|}{|w|\cdot|z|} = \frac{2}{(1)(3)} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.
Let $a$ be the number of adults and $c$ be the number of children
Then we have
$$25a + 12c = 1950 = 25 \times 78.$$Rearranging terms gives us
$$ a =  78 - \frac{12c}{25} .$$Since the number of adults must be an integer, this tells us that $c$ is a multiple of 25.
The ratio we want close to 1 is
$$\frac{a}{c} = \frac{78}{c} - \frac{12}{25}$$If $\frac{a}{c} = 1$, then $\frac{78}{c} - \frac{12}{25} = 1$, which means that $\frac{78}{c} = \frac{37}{25}$
In other words, $c = \frac{78 \cdot 25}{37}$.
The multiple of 25 that comes closest to this is 50, and hence $c$ must be 50
Then, $a =  78 - \frac{12 \cdot 50}{25} = 54$
So the ratio of adults to children closest to 1 is $\frac{54}{50} = \boxed{\frac{27}{25}}.$
By Vieta's formulas, \[\begin{aligned} 1 \cdot 2 +2 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 1=11 &= \frac ca \\1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 6 &= - \frac da
\end{aligned}\]Dividing these two equations, we get $\frac{11}{6} = -\frac{c}{d},$ so $\frac{c}{d} = \boxed{-\frac{11}{6}}.$
Since $0 \le \{x\} < 1,$ we have $0 \le 100 \{x\} < 100,$ so $5 \le 5 + 100 \{x\} < 105.$ Thus, \[5 \le \lfloor x\rfloor < 105.\]Since $\lfloor x\rfloor$ is an integer, the possible values of $\lfloor x\rfloor$ are $5, 6, \dots, 104.$ For each of these values of $\lfloor x\rfloor,$ we get a corresponding value \[\{x\} = \frac{\lfloor x\rfloor - 5}{100} = 0.01 \lfloor x \rfloor - 0.05,\]and then we have \[x = \lfloor x\rfloor + \{x\} = 1.01 \lfloor x \rfloor - 0.05.\]To maximize $x,$ we choose $\lfloor x \rfloor = 104,$ giving \[x = 1.01 \cdot 104 - 0.05 = \boxed{104.99}.\]
More generally, let
\[S_n = \sum_{k = 1}^n (-1)^k \cdot \frac{k^2 + k + 1}{k!}\]for a positive integer $n.$  We can compute the first few values of $S_n$:
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{array}{c|c}
n & S_n \\ \hline
1 & -3 \\
2 & \frac{1}{2} \\
3 & -\frac{5}{3} \\
4 & -\frac{19}{24} \\
5 & -\frac{21}{20} \\
6 & -\frac{713}{720}
\end{array}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}
\]First, the denominators seem to be factors of $n!.$  Second, the fractions seem to be getting close to $-1.$  So, we re-write each sum in the form $\frac{*}{n!} - 1$:
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{array}{c|c}
n & S_n \\ \hline
1 & \frac{-2}{1!} - 1 \\
2 & \frac{3}{2!} - 1 \\
3 & \frac{-4}{3!} - 1 \\
4 & \frac{5}{4!} - 1 \\
5 & \frac{-6}{5!} - 1 \\
6 & \frac{7}{6!} - 1 \\
\end{array}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}
\]Now the pattern is very clear: It appears that
\[S_n = (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n + 1}{n!} - 1.\]So, set $T_n = (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n + 1}{n!} - 1.$  Since we expect the sum to telescope, we can compute the difference $T_k - T_{k - 1}$:
\begin{align*}
T_k - T_{k - 1} &= (-1)^k \cdot \frac{k + 1}{k!} - 1 - (-1)^{k - 1} \cdot \frac{k}{(k - 1)!} + 1 \\
&= (-1)^k \cdot \frac{k + 1}{k!} + (-1)^k \cdot \frac{k}{(k - 1)!} \\
&= (-1)^k \cdot \frac{k + 1}{k!} + (-1)^k \cdot \frac{k^2}{k!} \\
&= (-1)^k \cdot \frac{k^2 + k + 1}{k!}.
\end{align*}Thus, indeed the sum telescopes, which verifies our formula
\[S_n = (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n + 1}{n!} - 1.\]In particular,
\[S_{100} = \frac{101}{100!} - 1.\]Then $a = 101,$ $b = 100,$ and $c = 1,$ so $a + b + c = \boxed{202}.$
We can represent the sum as
\[\sum_{n = 1}^{1987} n(1988 - n).\]This is equal to
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 1}^{1987} (1988n - n^2) &= 1988 \sum_{n = 1}^{1987} n - \sum_{n = 1}^{1987} n^2 \\
&= 1988 \cdot \frac{1987 \cdot 1988}{2} - \frac{1987 \cdot 1988 \cdot 3975}{6} \\
&= \frac{1987 \cdot 1988}{6} (3 \cdot 1988 - 3975) \\
&= \frac{1987 \cdot 2 \cdot 994}{6} \cdot 1989 \\
&= \frac{1987 \cdot 994}{3} \cdot 1989 \\
&= 1987 \cdot 994 \cdot 663.
\end{align*}Thus, $x = \boxed{663}.$
Our strategy is to add a number of inequalities like
\[a + b \ge 2 \sqrt{ab},\]so that when we add them up, we get an inequality of the form
\[t(a + b + c) \ge a + \sqrt{ab} + \sqrt[3]{abc}.\]To do so, we will use some variables, to make sure we use the most general forms of AM-GM.
If we apply AM-GM to two terms, one of which is $pb,$ then to obtain $\sqrt{ab}$ on the right-hand side, the other term must be $\frac{1}{4p} a,$ as in
\[\frac{1}{4p} a + pb \ge 2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{4p} a \cdot pb} = \sqrt{ab}
\quad (*)\]Note that equality holds when $\frac{1}{4p} a = pb,$ or $\frac{a}{b} = 4p^2.$  Thus,
We then want an inequality of the form
\[xa + yb + zc \ge \sqrt[3]{abc},\]where $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are coefficients that we want to fill in
We want equality to hold here for the same values of $a$ and $b$ as in $(*)$
This means we want $xa = yb,$ or $\frac{x}{y} = \frac{b}{a} = \frac{1}{4p^2}.$  So, let $x = \frac{1}{4pk}$ and $y = \frac{p}{k}$:
\[\frac{1}{4pk} a + \frac{p}{k} b + zc \ge \sqrt[3]{abc}.\]Finally, $z$ should be $\frac{4k^2}{27},$ so that we obtain $\sqrt[3]{abc}$ on the right-hand side:
\[\frac{1}{4pk} a + \frac{p}{k} b + \frac{4k^2}{27} c \ge 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{4pk} a \cdot \frac{p}{k} b \cdot \frac{4k^2}{27} c} = \sqrt[3]{abc}
\quad (**)\]Thus, we have the inequalities
\begin{align*}
a &\ge a, \\
\frac{1}{4p} a + pb &\ge \sqrt{ab}, \\
\frac{1}{4pk} a + \frac{p}{k} b + \frac{4k^2}{27} c &\ge \sqrt[3]{abc}.
\end{align*}When we add these up, we want the coefficients of $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ to be equal
\[1 + \frac{1}{4p} + \frac{1}{4pk} = p + \frac{p}{k} = \frac{4k^2}{27}.\]Isolating $p$ in $p + \frac{p}{k} = \frac{4k^2}{27},$ we find
\[p = \frac{4k^3}{27(k + 1)}.\]Then
\[1 + \frac{1}{4p} + \frac{1}{4pk} = \frac{4pk + k + 1}{4pk} = \frac{4k^2}{27}.\]Cross-multiplying, we get
\[27(4pk + k + 1) = 16pk^3.\]Substituting $p = \frac{4k^3}{27(k + 1)},$ we get
\[27 \left( 4k \cdot \frac{4k^3}{27(k + 1)} + k + 1 \right) = 16k^3 \cdot \frac{4k^3}{27(k + 1)}.\]Then
\[27(16k^4 + 27(k + 1)^2) = 64k^3.\]This simplifies to $64k^6 - 432k^4 - 729k^2 - 1458k - 729 = 0.$  Fortunately, this polynomial has $k = 3$ as a root.
Then $p = 1,$ and we get
\[\frac{4}{3} a + \frac{4}{3} b + \frac{4}{3} c \ge a + \sqrt{ab} + \sqrt[3]{abc}.\]Therefore,
\[a + \sqrt{ab} + \sqrt[3]{abc} \le \frac{4}{3}.\]Equality occurs when $a = \frac{16}{21},$ $b = \frac{4}{21},$ and $c = \frac{1}{21},$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}.$
From the given property,
\[|f(z) - z| = |f(z)|.\]Then
\[|(a + bi) z - z| = |(a + bi)z|,\]so $|a + bi - 1||z| = |a + bi||z|.$  Since this holds for all complex numbers $z,$
\[|a + bi - 1| = |a + bi| = 8.\]Then $(a - 1)^2 + b^2 = 64$ and $a^2 + b^2 = 64.$  Subtracting these equations, we get $2a - 1 = 0,$ so $a = \frac{1}{2}.$  Hence,
\[b^2 = 64 - a^2 = 64 - \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{\frac{255}{4}}.\]
To deal with the $|x|$ term, we take cases on the sign of $x$:
If $x \ge 0$, then we have $y^2+2xy+40x=400$
Isolating $x$, we have $x(2y+40) = 400-y^2$, which we can factor as \[2x(y+20) = (20-y)(y+20).\]Therefore, either $y=-20$, or $2x=20-y$, which is equivalent to $y=20-2x$.
If $x < 0$, then we have $y^2+2xy-40x=400$
Again isolating $x$, we have $x(2y-40) = 400-y^2$, which we can factor as \[2x(y-20) = (20-y)(y+20).\]Therefore, either $y=20$, or $2x=-y-20$, which is equivalent to $y=-20-2x$.
Putting these four lines together, we find that the bounded region is a parallelogram with vertices at $(0, \pm 20)$, $(20, -20)$, and $(-20, 20)$, as shown below: [asy]size(6cm);real f(real x) {return 20; } draw(graph(f, -25, 0)); real g(real x) { return -20; } draw(graph(g, 0, 25)); real h(real x){return 20-2*x;} draw(graph(h, 0,25)); real i(real x){return -20-2*x;} draw(graph(i, -25,0)); draw((0,-32)--(0,32),EndArrow); draw((-26,0)--(26,0),EndArrow); label("$x$",(26,0),S); label("$y$",(0,32),E); dot((0,20)--(0,-20)--(20,-20)--(-20,20));[/asy] The height of the parallelogram is $40$ and the base is $20$, so the area of the parallelogram is $40 \cdot 20 = \boxed{800}$.
We have that
\begin{align*}
a_2 &= a_1 + a_1 + 1 = 3, \\
a_3 &= a_1 + a_2 + 2 = 6, \\
a_6 &= a_3 + a_3 + 9 = 21, \\
a_{12} &= a_6 + a_6 + 36 = \boxed{78}.
\end{align*}
Setting $y = 1,$ we get
\[f(x) f(1) = f(x) + \frac{2005}{x} + 2005^2.\]The value $f(1)$ cannot be 1, and so we can solve for $f(x)$ to get
\[f(x) = \frac{2005/x + 2005^2}{f(1) - 1}.\]In particular,
\[f(1) = \frac{2005 + 2005^2}{f(1) - 1}.\]Then $f(1)^2 - f(1) - 2005^2 - 2005 = 0,$ which factors as $(f(1) - 2006)(f(1) + 2005) = 0.$  Hence, $f(1) = 2006$ or $f(1) = -2005.$
If $f(1) = 2006,$ then
\[f(x) = \frac{2005/x + 2005^2}{2005} = \frac{1}{x} + 2005.\]We can check that this function works.
If $f(1) = -2005,$ then
\[f(x) = \frac{2005/x + 2005^2}{-2006}.\]We can check that this function does not work.
Therefore,
\[f(x) = \frac{1}{x} + 2005,\]so $n = 1$ and $s = \frac{1}{2} + 2005 = \frac{4011}{2},$ so $n \times s = \boxed{\frac{4011}{2}}.$
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $z \le x$ and $z \le y.$  Then
\[(x^2 - xy + y^2)(x^2 - xz + z^2)(y^2 - yz + z^2) \le (x^2 - xy + y^2) x^2 y^2.\]By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
x^2 y^2 (x^2 - xy + y^2) &= \frac{4}{9} \left( \frac{3}{2} xy \right) \left( \frac{3}{2} xy \right) (x^2 - xy + y^2) \\
&\le \frac{4}{9} \left( \frac{\frac{3}{2} xy + \frac{3}{2} xy + (x^2 - xy + y^2)}{3} \right)^3 \\
&= \frac{4}{9} \left( \frac{x^2 + 2xy + y^2}{3} \right)^3 \\
&= \frac{4}{9} \cdot \frac{(x + y)^6}{27} \\
&\le \frac{4}{243} (x + y + z)^6 \\
&= \frac{256}{243}.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x = \frac{4}{3},$ $y = \frac{2}{3},$ and $z = 0,$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{256}{243}}.$
Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers
Then both
\[z + \overline{z} = (x + yi) + (x - yi) = 2x,\]and
\[z \overline{z} = (x + yi)(x - yi) = x^2 + y^2\]are real numbers
Therefore, by Vieta's formulas, all the coefficients must be real numbers
Then $(a,b) = \boxed{(0,0)}.$
We can write
\[\frac{1}{(n + 1) H_n H_{n + 1}} = \frac{\frac{1}{n + 1}}{H_n H_{n + 1}} = \frac{H_{n + 1} - H_n}{H_n H_{n + 1}} = \frac{1}{H_n} - \frac{1}{H_{n + 1}}.\]Thus,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(n + 1) H_n H_{n + 1}} &= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{H_n} - \frac{1}{H_{n + 1}} \right) \\
&= \left( \frac{1}{H_1} - \frac{1}{H_2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{H_2} - \frac{1}{H_3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{H_3} - \frac{1}{H_4} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \frac{1}{H_1} = \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}Note that this result depends on the fact that $H_n \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty.$  We can prove this as follows:
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} &\ge \frac{1}{2}, \\
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} &> \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}, \\
\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{8} &> \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2},
\end{align*}and so on
\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \dotsb > 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \dotsb,\]which shows that $H_n \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty.$
We can write
\[16^{(2^x)} = (2^4)^{(2^x)} = 2^{4 \cdot 2^x}.\]Then $2^{16^x} = 2^{4 \cdot 2^x},$ so
\[16^x = 4 \cdot 2^x.\]In turn, we can write this as
\[2^{4x} = 2^{x + 2},\]so $4x = x + 2.$  Therefore, $x = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
x^{100} &= [(x + 1) - 1]^{100} \\
&= (x + 1)^{100} - \binom{100}{1} (x + 1)^{99} + \binom{100}{2} (x + 1)^{98} + \dots - \binom{100}{97} (x + 1)^3 + \binom{100}{98} (x + 1)^2 - \binom{100}{99} (x + 1) + 1.
\end{align*}When this is divided by $(x + 1)^3,$ the remainder is then
\[\binom{100}{98} (x + 1)^2 - \binom{100}{99} (x + 1) + 1 = \boxed{4950x^2 + 9800x + 4851}.\]
We can easily prove by induction that $t_k > 1$ for $k$ even, and $0 < t_k < 1$ for $k$ odd
Hence, $n$ is odd, and $t_{n - 1} = \frac{87}{19}.$  Then $t_{n - 1}$ must have been generated from the rule of adding 1, which means $n - 1$ is even
Furthermore, $\frac{87}{19} = 4 + \frac{11}{19},$ so this rule must have been applied four times
Thus, $n - 1$ is divisible by 16, and
\[t_{\frac{n - 1}{16}} = \frac{11}{19}.\]Since $\frac{11}{19} < 1,$ this term must have been generated from the rule of taking the reciprocal, which means $\frac{n - 1}{16}$ is odd
\[t_{\frac{n - 17}{16}} = \frac{19}{11}.\]We can keep working backwards to produce the following terms:
\begin{align*}
t_{\frac{n - 17}{32}} &= \frac{8}{11}, \\
t_{\frac{n - 49}{32}} &= \frac{11}{8}, \\
t_{\frac{n - 49}{64}} &= \frac{3}{8}, \\
t_{\frac{n - 113}{64}} &= \frac{8}{3}, \\
t_{\frac{n - 113}{256}} &= \frac{2}{3}, \\
t_{\frac{n - 369}{256}} &= \frac{3}{2}, \\
t_{\frac{n - 369}{512}} &= \frac{1}{2}, \\
t_{\frac{n - 881}{512}} &= 2, \\
t_{\frac{n - 881}{1024}} &= 1.
\end{align*}Then $\frac{n - 881}{1024} = 1,$ so $n = \boxed{1905}.$
By Vieta's formulas,
\begin{align*}
c + d &= 10a, \\
cd &= -11b, \\
a + b &= 10c, \\
ab &= -11d.
\end{align*}From the first equation,
\[d = 10a - c.\]From the third equation,
\[b = 10c - a.\]Substituting into the second and fourth equations, we get
\begin{align*}
c(10a - c) &= -11(10c - a), \\
a(10c - a) &= -11(10a - c).
\end{align*}Expanding, we get
\begin{align*}
10ac - c^2 &= -110c + 11a, \\
10ac - a^2 &= -110a + 11c.
\end{align*}Subtracting these equations, we get
\[a^2 - c^2 = 121a - 121c,\]so $(a + c)(a - c) = 121(a - c).$  Since $a$ and $c$ are distinct, we can divide both sides by $a - c,$ to get
\[a + c = 121.\]Hence, $a + b + c + d = 10c + 10a = 10(a + c) = \boxed{1210}.$
Since $-2 - 3i$ is a root
\[a (-2 - 3i)^3 + 3 (-2 - 3i)^2 + b (-2 - 3i) - 65 = 0.\]Expanding, we get
\[(-80 + 46a - 2b) + (36 - 9a - 3b)i = 0.\]Then $-80 + 46a - 2b = 0$ and $36 - 9a - 3b = 0.$  Solving, we find $a = 2$ and $b = 6.$
The cubic polynomial is then $2x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x - 65 = 0,$ which factors as $(2x - 5)(x^2 + 4x + 13) = 0.$  Therefore, the real root is $\boxed{\frac{5}{2}}.$
We write the functional equation as
\[f(x)f(y) - f(xy) = 3x + 3y + 6.\]Setting $x = y = 0,$ we get
\[f(0)^2 - f(0) = 6.\]Then $f(0)^2 - f(0) - 6 = 0,$ which factors as $(f(0) - 3)(f(0) + 2) = 0.$  Hence, $f(0) = 3$ or $f(0) = -2.$
Setting $y = 0,$ we get
\[f(0) f(x) - f(0) = 3x + 6.\]Then
\[f(x) - 1 = \frac{3x + 6}{f(0)},\]so
\[f(x) = \frac{3x + 6}{f(0)} + 1.\]If $f(0) = 3,$ then $f(x) = x + 3,$ which does satisfy the functional equation
If $f(0) = -2,$ then
\[f(x) = -\frac{3}{2} x - 2,\]which does not satisfy the functional equation
Therefore, $f(x) = \boxed{x + 3}.$
Let $\alpha = 2 + \sqrt{3}$ and $\beta = 2 - \sqrt{3}.$  Then consider the number
\begin{align*}
N &= \alpha^{1000} + \beta^{1000} \\
&= (2 + \sqrt{3})^{1000} + (2 - \sqrt{3})^{1000} \\
&= 2^{1000} + \binom{1000}{1} 2^{999} (\sqrt{3}) + \binom{1000}{2} 2^{998} (\sqrt{3})^2 + \binom{1000}{3} (\sqrt{3})^3 + \dotsb \\
&\quad + 2^{1000} - \binom{1000}{1} 2^{999} (\sqrt{3}) + \binom{1000}{2} 2^{998} (\sqrt{3})^2 - \binom{1000}{3} (\sqrt{3})^3 + \dotsb.
\end{align*}Adding $(2 + \sqrt{3})^{1000}$ and $(2 - \sqrt{3})^{1000}$, we see that all the terms containing a $\sqrt{3}$ will cancel, meaning that we are left with an integer.
Furthermore,
\[\beta = 2 - \sqrt{3} = \frac{(2 - \sqrt{3})(2 + \sqrt{3})}{2 + \sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{3}} < 1,\]so $0 < \beta^{1000} < 1.$
Therefore,
\[N - 1 < \alpha^{1000} < N,\]which means $n = \lfloor \alpha^{1000} \rfloor = N - 1.$
\[f = x - n = \alpha^{1000} - (N - 1) = 1 - \beta^{1000},\]so $1 - f = \beta^{1000}.$  Hence,
\begin{align*}
x(1 - f) &= \alpha^{1000} \beta^{1000} \\
&= (\alpha \beta)^{1000} \\
&= [(2 + \sqrt{3})(2 - \sqrt{3})]^{1000} \\
&= 1^{1000} \\
&= \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
Let $y = \frac{x^2 - f(x)}{2}.$  Then
\[f \left( f(x) + \frac{x^2 - f(x)}{2} \right) = f \left( x^2 - \frac{x^2 - f(x)}{2} \right) + 4f(x) \cdot \frac{x^2 - f(x)}{2}.\]Simplifying, we get
\[f \left( \frac{x^2 + f(x)}{2} \right) = f \left( \frac{x^2 + f(x)}{2} \right) + 2f(x) (x^2 - f(x)),\]so $f(x) (x^2 - f(x)) = 0.$  This tells us that for each individual value of $x,$ either $f(x) = 0$ or $f(x) = x^2.$  (Note that we cannot conclude that the only solutions are $f(x) = 0$ or $f(x) = x^2.$)  Note that in either case, $f(0) = 0.$
We can verify that the function $f(x) = x^2$ is a solution
Suppose there exists a nonzero value $a$ such that $f(a) \neq a^2.$  Then $f(a) = 0.$  Setting $x = 0$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[f(y) = f(-y).\]In other words, $f$ is even.
Setting $x = a$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[f(y) = f(a^2 - y).\]Replacing $y$ with $-y,$ we get $f(-y) = f(a^2 + y).$  Hence,
\[f(y) = f(y + a^2)\]for all values of $y.$
Setting $y = a^2$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[f(f(x) + a^2) = f(x^2 - a^2) + 4a^2 f(x).\]We know $f(f(x) + a^2) = f(f(x))$ and $f(x^2 - a^2) = f(x^2),$ so
\[f(f(x)) = f(x^2) + 4a^2 f(x)
\quad (*)\]Setting $y = 0$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[f(f(x)) = f(x^2).\]Comparing this equation to $(*),$ we see that $4a^2 f(x) = 0$ for all values of $x,$ which means $f(x) = 0$ for all $x.$  We see that this function satisfies the given functional equation.
Thus, there are two functions that work, namely $f(x) = 0$ and $f(x) = x^2.$  This means $n = 2$ and $s = 0 + 9 = 9,$ so $n \times s = \boxed{18}.$
If $x^n + x^{n - 1} + \dots + x + 1 = 0,$ then
\[(x - 1)(x^n + x^{n - 1} + \dots + x + 1) = 0,\]which expands as $x^{n + 1} - 1 = 0.$  Then $x^{n + 1} = 1.$  The only possible real roots of this equation are $x = 1$ and $x = -1.$
Note that $x = 1$ cannot be a real root of
\[x^n + x^{n - 1} + \dots + x + 1 = 0,\]but $x = -1$ is a root whenever $n$ is odd
Therefore, the maximum number of real roots is $\boxed{1}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
f(2) &= 5(2) - 4 = 6, \\
f(f(2)) &= f(6) = 5(6) - 4 = 26, \\
f(f(f(2))) &= f(f(6)) = f(26) = 5(26) - 4 = \boxed{126}.
\end{align*}
Let $y = \sqrt[3]{2 - x}.$  Then $y^3 = 2 - x,$ so $x = 2 - y^3.$  Then
\[\sqrt{x - 1} = \sqrt{1 - y^3},\]so we can write the given equation as $y + \sqrt{1 - y^3} = 1.$  Then
\[\sqrt{1 - y^3} = 1 - y.\]Squaring both sides, we get $1 - y^3 = 1 - 2y + y^2,$ so $y^3 + y^2 - 2y = 0.$  This factors as $y(y - 1)(y + 2) = 0,$ so $y$ can be 0, 1, or $-2.$
These lead to $x = \boxed{1,2,10}.$  We check that these solutions work.
Consider the first equation, \[\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} = 2.4.\]Because $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is an integer, while $0 \le \{y\} < 1,$ the only possibility is that $\lfloor x \rfloor = 2$ and $\{y\} = 0.4.$ Similarly, from the second equation, we get $\{x\} = 0.1$ and $\lfloor y \rfloor = 5.$ Then \[x = \lfloor x \rfloor + \{x\} = 2.1 \]and \[y = \lfloor y \rfloor + \{y\} = 5.4,\]so $|x-y| = |2.1-5.4| = \boxed{3.3}.$
First note that \[\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor =
\begin{cases}1 & \text{if $x$ is not an integer}, \\ 0 & \text{if $x$
is an integer}
\end{cases} \]Thus for any positive integer $k$, \[\lceil \log_{\sqrt{2}}{k}\rceil-\lfloor \log_{\sqrt{2}}{k}\rfloor=
\begin{cases}1 & \text{if $k$ not an integer power of $\sqrt{2}$}, \\
0 & \text{if $k$ an integer power of $\sqrt{2}$}
\end{cases}\]The integers $k$, $1 \leq k \leq 1000$, that are integer powers of $\sqrt{2}$ are described by $k = 2^j$, $0 \leq j \leq 9$
Thus \[\sum_{k=1}^{1000} k (\lceil \log_{\sqrt{2}}{k}\rceil - \lfloor
\log_{\sqrt{2}}{k}\rfloor) = \sum_{k=1}^{1000}k - \sum_{j=0}^9 2^j = \frac{1000 \cdot 1001}{2} - 1023 = \boxed{499477}.\]
By the Integer Root Theorem, an integer root must divide the constant term
In this case, $r^2$ must divide 18
Thus, the only possible values of $r$ are $\boxed{-3,-1,1,3}.$
We have \[
0 = f(-1) = -a+b-c+d\]and \[0 = f(1) = a+b+c+d,
\]so $b+d=0$
Also $d=f(0) = 2$, so $b=\boxed{-2}$.
One the first two statements, at most one of them can be true ($x^2$ cannot be both less than 1 and greater than 1)
Of the next two statements, at most one of them can be true ($x$ cannot be both less than 0 and greater than 0)
Hence, at most three statements can be true.
For $0 < x < 1,$ the first, fourth, and fifth statements are true, so the maximum number of statements that can be true is $\boxed{3}.$
Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers
Then the equation $|z - 3| = 2|z + 3|$ becomes
\[|x + yi - 3| = 2 |x + yi + 3|,\]so
\[(x - 3)^2 + y^2 = 4[(x + 3)^2 + y^2].\]This simplifies to $x^2 + 10x + y^2 + 9 = 0.$  Completing the square, we get
\[(x + 5)^2 + y^2 = 4^2.\]This is the circle centered at $-5$ with radius 4.
unitsize(0.4 cm);
draw(Circle((0,0),1),red);
draw(Circle((0,0),9),red);
draw(Circle((-5,0),4));
draw((-10.5,0)--(10.5,0));
draw((0,-10.5)--(0,10.5));
label("$4$", (-3,0), N);
label("$4$", (-7,0), N);
dot("$-5$", (-5,0), S);
[/asy]
The graph of $|z| = k$ is a circle centered at the origin with radius $k.$  We see that the circles with radius $\boxed{1}$ and $\boxed{9}$ intersect the circle $(x + 5)^2 + y^2 = 4^2$ in exactly one point.
Let $r$ be the common ratio
Then $a_2 = r$ and $a_3 = r^2,$ so
\[4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2 = 5 \left( r + \frac{2}{5} \right)^2 - \frac{4}{5}.\]Thus, the minimum value is $\boxed{-\frac{4}{5}},$ which occurs when $r = -\frac{2}{5}.$
Let $S = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{F_n}{10^n}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
S &= F_0 + \frac{F_1}{10} + \frac{F_2}{10^2} + \frac{F_3}{10^3} + \dotsb \\
&= \frac{F_0 + 1}{10} + \frac{F_1 + F_0}{10^2} + \frac{F_2 + F_1}{10^3} + \dotsb \\
&= \frac{1}{10} + \frac{F_0}{10} + \frac{F_1}{10^2} + \frac{F_2}{10^3} + \dotsb + \frac{F_0}{10^2} + \frac{F_1}{10^3} + \dotsb \\
&= \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10} S + \frac{1}{10^2} S.
\end{align*}Solving, we find $S = \boxed{\frac{10}{89}}.$
We read that $a^2 = 27,$ so $a = \sqrt{27} = 3 \sqrt{3}.$  Therefore, the distance between the vertices is $2a = \boxed{6 \sqrt{3}}.$
The powers of $i$ cycle through $i^0 = 1,$ $i^1 = i,$ $i^2 = -1,$ and $i^3 = -i,$ and the sum of any four consecutive powers of $i$ is
\[1 + i + (-1) + (-i) = 0.\]Thus, the sum reduces to $i^{2008} + i^{2009} = \boxed{1 + i}.$
We can write $9x = 10 \lfloor x \rfloor.$  Since $x = \lfloor x \rfloor + \{x\},$
\[9 \lfloor x \rfloor + 9 \{x\} = 10 \lfloor x \rfloor.\]Then $9 \{x\} = \lfloor x \rfloor.$ Since $\{x\} < 1,$ $\lfloor x \rfloor = 9 \{x\} < 9.$   Thus, $\lfloor x \rfloor \le 8.$
If $\lfloor x \rfloor = 8,$ then $\{x\} = \frac{8}{9},$ so the largest possible value of $x$ is $8 + \frac{8}{9} = \boxed{\frac{80}{9}}.$
Let $BC = 40x$ and $AC = 41x.$  By Triangle Inequality, $x$ must satisfy
\begin{align*}
9 + 40x &> 41x, \\
9 + 41x &> 40x, \\
40x + 41x &> 9.
\end{align*}The first inequality tells us $x < 9,$ the second inequality always holds, and the third inequality tells us $x > \frac{1}{9}.$
The semi-perimeter is $s = \frac{9 + 81x}{2},$ so by Heron's formula,
\begin{align*}
[ABC]^2 &= \frac{9 + 81x}{2} \cdot \frac{81x - 9}{2} \cdot \frac{9 + x}{2} \cdot \frac{9 - x}{2} \\
&= \frac{81}{16} (9x + 1)(9x - 1)(9 + x)(9 - x) \\
&= \frac{81}{16} (81x^2 - 1)(81 - x^2) \\
&= \frac{1}{16} (81x^2 - 1)(81^2 - 81x^2).
\end{align*}By AM-GM,
\[(81x^2 - 1)(81^2 - 81x^2) \le \left[ \frac{(81x^2 - 1) + (81^2 - 81x^2)}{2} \right]^2 = 3280^2,\]so
\[[ABC] \le \sqrt{\frac{3280^2}{16}} = 820.\]Equality occurs when $81x^2 - 1 = 81^2 - 81x^2,$ or $x^2 = \frac{3281}{81},$ so the maximum area is $\boxed{820}.$
Let $A = (a,a^2).$  Then the equation of the tangent at $A$ is of the form
\[y - a^2 = m(x - a).\]Setting $y = x^2,$ we get $x^2 - a^2 = m(x - a),$ or $x^2 - mx + ma - a^2 = 0.$  Since we have a tangent, this quadratic will have a double root of $x = a$; in other words, this quadratic is identical to $x^2 - 2ax + a^2 = 0.$  Hence, $m = 2a.$
Therefore, the equation of the tangent at $A$ is
\[y - a^2 = 2a(x - a).\]Similarly, the equation of the tangent at $B$ is
\[y - b^2 = 2b(x - b).\]To find the point of intersection $P,$ we set the value of $y$ equal to each other
This gives us
\[2a(x - a) + a^2 = 2b(x - b) + b^2.\]Then $2ax - a^2 = 2bx - b^2,$ so
\[(2a - 2b)x = a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b).\]Since $a \neq b,$ we can divide both sides by $2a - 2b,$ to get
\[x = \frac{a + b}{2}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
y &= 2a(x - a) + a^2 \\
&= 2a \left( \frac{a + b}{2} - a \right) + a^2 \\
&= a^2 + ab - 2a^2 + a^2 \\
&= ab.
\end{align*}Note that the two tangents are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is $-1.$  This gives us $(2a)(2b) = -1.$  Hence, the $y$-coordinate of $P$ is always $ab = \boxed{-\frac{1}{4}}.$  This means that the intersection point $P$ always lies on the directrix $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$
Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers
Then $|x + yi - 5 - i| = |(x - 5) + (y - 1)i| = 5,$ so
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 25.\]This simplifies to $x^2 - 10x + y^2 - 2y = -1.$
\begin{align*}
|z - 1 + 2i|^2 + |z - 9 - 4i|^2 &= |x + yi - 1 + 2i|^2 + |x + yi - 9 - 4i|^2 \\
&= |(x - 1) + (y + 2)i|^2 + |(x - 9) + (y - 4)i|^2 \\
&= (x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 + (x - 9)^2 + (y - 4)^2 \\
&= 2x^2 - 20x + 2y^2 - 4y + 102 \\
&= 2(x^2 - 10x + y^2 - 2y) + 102 \\
&= 2(-1) + 102 = 100.
\end{align*}Thus, the expression is always equal to $\boxed{100}.$
Geometrically, the condition $|z - 5 - i| = 5$ states that $z$ lies on a circle centered at $5 + i$ with radius 5.
unitsize(0.5 cm);
pair A, B, O, Z;
A = (1,-2);
B = (9,4);
O = (5,1);
Z = O + 5*dir(110);
draw(Circle(O,5));
draw(A--B);
draw(O--Z);
draw(A--Z--B);
draw(rightanglemark(A,Z,B,20));
dot("$1 - 2i$", A, SW);
dot("$9 + 4i$", B, NE);
dot("$5 + i$", O, SE);
dot("$z$", Z, NW);
[/asy]
Note that $1 - 2i$ and $9 + 4i$ are diametrically opposite on this circle
Hence, when we join $z$ to $1 - 2i$ and $9 + 4i,$ we obtain a right angle
Thus, the expression in the problem is equal to the square of the diameter, which is $10^2 = 100.$
Let $f(x)$ be the quantity on the left-hand side
Constructing a sign table, we get \begin{tabular}{c|ccc|c} &$2x-7$ &$x-3$ &$x$ &$f(x)$ \\ \hline$x<0$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$0<x<3$ &$-$&$-$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$3<x<\frac{7}{2}$ &$-$&$+$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$x>\frac{7}{2}$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]\end{tabular}It follows that $f(x) > 0$ when $0 < x < 3$ or $x > \tfrac72.$ Since the inequality is nonstrict, we must include the values of $x$ such that $f(x) = 0,$ which are $x=3$ and $x=\tfrac72.$ Thus, the solution set is \[x \in \boxed{(0, 3] \cup [\tfrac72, \infty)}.\]
The largest difference must be $w - z = 9.$  The two differences $w - x$ and $x - z$ must add up to $w - z = 9.$  Similarly, the two differences of $w - y$ and $y - z$ must add up to 9
Thus, $\{w - x, x - z\}$ and $\{w - y, y - z\}$ must be $\{3,6\}$ and $\{4,5\}$ in some order
This leaves $x - y = 1.$
Case 1: $\{w - x, x - z\} = \{3,6\}$ and $\{w - y, y - z\} = \{4,5\}.$
Since $w - x < w - y \le 4,$ we must have $w - x = 3,$ so $x - z = 6.$  Since $x - y = 1,$ $y - z = 5.$
Thus, $z = w - 9,$ $x = w - 3,$ and $y = w - 4.$  We also know $w + x + y + z = 44,$ so
\[w + (w - 3) + (w - 4) + (w - 9) = 44.\]Hence, $w = 15.$
Case 2: $\{w - x, x - z\} = \{4,5\}$ and $\{w - y, y - z\} = \{3,6\}.$
Since $y - z < x - z \le 4,$ we must have $y - z = 3,$ so $w - y = 6.$  Since $x - y = 1,$ $w - x = 5.$
Thus, $z = w - 9,$ $x = w - 5,$ and $y = w - 6.$   Since $w + x + y + z = 44,$
\[w + (w - 5) + (w - 6) + (w - 9) = 44.\]Hence, $w = 16.$
The sum of all possible values of $w$ is then $15 + 16 = \boxed{31}.$
The first few terms of the sequence are
\[2005, 133, 55, 250, 133.\]Since each term depends only on the previous term, and the fifth term coincides with the second term, the sequence becomes periodic, with period 3.
Therefore, the 2005th term is equal to the 4th term, which is $\boxed{250}.$
Let $S = g(1) + g(2) + \dots + g(20).$  Then by definition of a tenuous function,
\begin{align*}
S &= [g(20) + g(1)] + [g(19) + g(2)] + [g(18) + g(3)] + \dots + [g(11) + g(10)] \\
&\ge (20^2 + 1) + (19^2 + 1) + (18^2 + 1) + \dots + (11^2 + 1) \\
&= 2495
\end{align*}Let's assume that $S = 2495,$ and try to find a function $g(x)$ that works
Then we must have
\begin{align*}
g(20) + g(1) &= 20^2 + 1, \\
g(19) + g(2) &= 19^2 + 1, \\
g(18) + g(3) &= 18^2 + 1, \\
&\dots, \\
g(11) + g(10) &= 11^2 + 1.
\end{align*}If $g(1) < g(2),$ then
\[g(19) + g(1) < g(19) + g(2) = 19^2 + 1,\]contradicting the fact that $g$ is tenuous.
And if $g(1) > g(2),$ then
\[g(20) + g(2) < g(20) + g(1) = 20^2 + 1,\]again contradicting the fact that $g$ is tenuous
Therefore, we must have $g(1) = g(2).$
In the same way, we can prove that $g(1) = g(3),$ $g(1) = g(4),$ and so on, up to $g(1) = g(10).$  Hence,
\[g(1) = g(2) = \dots = g(10).\]Let $a = g(1) = g(2) = \dots = g(10).$  Then $g(n) = n^2 + 1 - a$ for all $n \ge 11.$  Since $g(11) + g(11) \ge 122,$ $g(11) \ge 61.$  But $g(11) = 121 + 1 - a = 122 - a \le 61,$ so $a \le 61.$  The smallest possible value of $g(14)$ is then $14^2 + 1 - 61 = \boxed{136}.$
We know that
$$\begin{aligned} f(g(a)) &= f(4-a) \\
&= \frac{4-a}{5} + 3 = 5.
\end{aligned}$$Multiplying both sides by 5 gives us
$$ 4-a + 15 = 25.$$Solving for $a$,
$$ a = \boxed{-6}.$$
We can write $2(x^2 + y^2) = x + y$ as $2x^2 + 2y^2 = x + y.$  Then $2x^2 + 4xy + 2y^2 = x + y + 4xy,$ so
\[4xy = 2(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) - (x + y) = 2(x + y)^2 - (x + y).\]Also,
\begin{align*}
(x - y)^2 &= x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \\
&= (x + y)^2 - 4xy \\
&= (x + y) - (x + y)^2.
\end{align*}Completing the square in $x + y,$ we get
\[(x - y)^2 = \frac{1}{4} - \left( x + y - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \le \frac{1}{4},\]so $x - y \le \frac{1}{2}.$
Equality occurs when $x = \frac{1}{2}$ and $y = 0,$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
First, we use the fact that $\frac{\log b}{\log a}=\log_a b$ to turn $\log_4 x$ into $\frac{\log_2 x}{\log_2 4}=\frac{1}{2}\log_2 x.$ That means that $\frac{3}{2}\log_2 x=6.$ Dividing each side by $\frac{3}{2},$ we get $\log_2 x=4,$ or $2^4=x.$ Thus, $x = \boxed{16}.$
First, consider the function
\[g(x) = x + \frac{1}{x}.\]If $1 \le x < y,$ then
\begin{align*}
g(y) - g(x) &= y + \frac{1}{y} - x - \frac{1}{x} \\
&= y - x + \frac{1}{y} - \frac{1}{x} \\
&= y - x + \frac{x - y}{xy} \\
&= (y - x) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{xy} \right) \\
&= \frac{(y - x)(xy - 1)}{xy} \\
\end{align*}Thus, $g(x)$ is increasing on the interval $[1,\infty).$
By AM-GM (and what we just proved above),
\[x + \frac{1}{x} \ge 2,\]so
\[g \left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right) \ge 2 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2}.\]Equality occurs when $x = 1,$ to the minimum value of $f(x)$ for $x > 0$ is $\boxed{\frac{5}{2}}.$
In particular, we cannot use the following argument: By AM-GM,
\[x + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x + \frac{1}{x}} \ge 2 \sqrt{\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{x + \frac{1}{x}}} = 2.\]However, we cannot conclude that the minimum is 2, because equality can occur only when $x + \frac{1}{x} = 1,$ and this is not possible.
We have that
\[x_3 = (\sqrt[3]{3})^{\sqrt[3]{3}})^{\sqrt[3]{3}} = (\sqrt[3]{3})^{\sqrt[3]{9}},\]and
\[x_4 = (\sqrt[3]{3})^{\sqrt[9]{3}})^{\sqrt[3]{3}} = (\sqrt[3]{3})^{\sqrt[3]{27}} = (\sqrt[3]{3})^3 = 3,\]so the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{4}.$
Recall that a parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus $F$ and the directrix.
Since the parabola $y = x^2$ is symmetric about the $y$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(0,f).$  Let $y = d$ be the equation of the directrix.
unitsize(1.5 cm);
pair F, P, Q;
F = (0,1/4);
P = (1,1);
Q = (1,-1/4);

return(x^2);

dot("$F$", F, NW);
dot("$P$", P, E);
dot("$Q$", Q, S);
[/asy]
Let $(x,x^2)$ be a point on the parabola $y = x^2.$  Then
\[PF^2 = x^2 + (x^2 - f)^2\]and $PQ^2 = (x^2 - d)^2.$  Thus,
\[x^2 + (x^2 - f)^2 = (x^2 - d)^2.\]Expanding, we get
\[x^2 + x^4 - 2fx^2 + f^2 = x^4 - 2dx^2 + d^2.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
1 - 2f &= -2d, \\
f^2 &= d^2.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $f - d = \frac{1}{2}.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $2f = \frac{1}{2},$ so $f = \frac{1}{4}.$
Thus, the focus is $\boxed{\left( 0, \frac{1}{4} \right)}.$
Each of the six values $f(1),$ $f(2),$ $f(3),$ $f(5),$ $f(6),$ $f(7)$ is equal to 12 or $-12.$  The equation $f(x) = 12$ has at most three roots, and the equation $f(x) = -12$ has at most three roots, so exactly three of the values are equal to 12, and the other three are equal to $-12.$
Furthermore, let $s$ be the sum of the $x$ that such that $f(x) = 12.$  Then by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the $x$ such that $f(x) = -12$ is also equal to $s.$  (The polynomials $f(x) - 12$ and $f(x) + 12$ only differ in the constant term.)  Hence,
\[2s = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 24,\]so $s = 12.$
The only ways to get three numbers from $\{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7\}$ to add up to 12 are $1 + 5 + 6$ and $2 + 3 + 7.$  Without loss of generality, assume that $f(1) = f(5) = f(6) = -12$ and $f(2) = f(3) = f(7) = 12.$
Let $g(x) = f(x) + 12.$  Then $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial, and $g(1) = g(5) = g(6) = 0,$ so
\[g(x) = c(x - 1)(x - 5)(x - 6)\]for some constant $c.$  Also, $g(2) = 24,$ so
\[24 = c(2 - 1)(2 - 5)(2 - 6).\]This leads to $c = 2.$  Then $g(x) = 2(x - 1)(x - 5)(x - 6),$ so
\[f(x) = 2(x - 1)(x - 5)(x - 6) - 12.\]In particular, $|f(0)| = \boxed{72}.$
We have the factorization
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz).\]Expanding $(x - y)^2 + (x - z)^2 + (y - z)^2 = xyz,$ we get
\[2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 - 2xy - 2xz - 2yz = xyz,\]so $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz = \frac{xyz}{2},$ and
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 20 \cdot \frac{xyz}{2} = 10xyz.\]Then $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 13xyz,$ so
\[\frac{x^3 + y^3 + z^3}{xyz} = \boxed{13}.\]
Let $p$ and $q$ be the roots
Then by Vieta's formulas, $p + q = 63.$
If both $p$ and $q$ are odd, then $p + q$ is even, so one of $p$ or $q$ must be even
This means one of $p$ and $q$ is 2, and the other is $63 - 2 = 61.$  Therefore, $k = 2 \cdot 61 = 122,$ so there is only $\boxed{1}$ possible value of $k.$
Expanding both sides gives \[z^3 - (r+s+t)z^2 + (rs+st+rt)z - rst = z^3 - c(r+s+t)z^2 + c^2(rs+st+rt)z - c^3rst.\]Since this equation holds for all $z,$ we must have \[\left\{ \begin{aligned} -(r+s+t) &= -c(r+s+t), \\ rs+st+rt &= c^2(rs+st+rt), \\ -rst &= -c^3rst
\end{aligned} \right.\]If none of $c, c^2, c^3$ are equal to $1,$ then these equations imply that \[r + s + t = rs + st + rt = rst = 0.\]Then $r, s, t$ are the roots of the polynomial $z^3 - 0z^2 - 0z - 0 = z^3,$ so $r = s = t = 0,$ which contradicts the fact that $r, s, t$ must be distinct
Therefore, at least one of the numbers $c, c^2, c^3$ must be equal to $1.$
If $c = 1,$ then all three equations are satisfied for any values of $r, s, t.$ If $c^2 = 1,$ then the equations are satisfied when $(r, s, t) = (0, 1, -1).$ If $c^3 = 1,$ then the equations are satisfied when $(r, s, t) = \left(1, -\tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{\sqrt3}{2}i, -\tfrac{1}{2} - \tfrac{\sqrt3}{2}i\right).$ Therefore, all such $c$ work
The equations $c = 1,$ $c^2 = 1,$ and $c^3 = 1$ have a total of $1+2+3=6$ roots, but since $c=1$ satisfies all three of them, it is counted three times, so the number of possible values of $c$ is $6 - 2 = \boxed{4}.$
The square root $\sqrt{x - 5}$ is defined only for $x \ge 5.$  Moreoever, $\sqrt{x - 5}$ is in the denominator of the fraction, so it cannot be 0, i.e
$x$ cannot be 5
Therefore, the domain of the function is $\boxed{(5,\infty)}.$
Since $x+1$ divides $x^2+ax+b$ and the constant term is $b$, we have $x^2+ax+b=(x+1)(x+b)$, and similarly $x^2+bx+c=(x+1)(x+c)$
Therefore, $a=b+1=c+2$
Furthermore, the least common multiple of the two polynomials is $(x+1)(x+b)(x+b-1)=x^3-4x^2+x+6$, so $b=-2$
Thus $a=-1$ and $c=-3$, and $a+b+c=\boxed{-6}$.
From the condition $f^{-1}(x) = f(x),$ $f(f^{-1}(x)) = f(f(x)),$ which simplifies to $f(f(x)) = x.$
Note that
\begin{align*}
f(f(x)) &= f \left( \frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2} \right) \\
&= \frac{2 \cdot \frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2} + 3}{k \cdot \frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2} - 2} \\
&= \frac{2(2x + 3) + 3(kx - 2)}{k(2x + 3) - 2(kx - 2)} \\
&= \frac{4x + 6 + 3kx - 6}{2kx + 3k - 2kx + 4} \\
&= \frac{(3k + 4)x}{3k + 4} \\
\end{align*}Thus, $f(f(x)) = x$ for all real numbers $k,$ except when $3k + 4 = 0,$ or $k = -4/3.$  Note that when $k = -4/3,$
\[f(x) = \frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2} = \frac{2x + 3}{-\frac{4}{3} x - 2} = \frac{3(2x + 3)}{-4x - 6} = \frac{3 (2x + 3)}{-2 (2x + 3)} = -\frac{3}{2},\]so $f(x)$ does not have an inverse
Hence, the answer is $k \in \boxed{(-\infty,-\frac{4}{3}) \cup (-\frac{4}{3},\infty)}.$
Let $y = f(x) = q(p(r(x))).$  Applying $q^{-1},$ we get
\[q^{-1}(y) = p(r(x)).\]Applying $p^{-1},$ we get
\[p^{-1}(q^{-1}(y)) = r(x).\]Finally, applying $r^{-1}(x),$ we get
\[r^{-1}(p^{-1}(q^{-1}(y))) = x.\]Hence, $f^{-1} = r^{-1} \circ p^{-1} \circ q^{-1}.$  The correct answer is $\boxed{\text{C}}.$
Let the three numbers be $x,$ $y,$ and $z.$  Without loss of generality, assume that $x \le y \le z.$  Then $z \le 2x.$
Suppose $z < 2x.$  Let $x_1 = \frac{x + z}{3}$ and $z_1 = \frac{2x + 2z}{3}.$  Then $z_1 = 2x_1,$ and $x_1 + z_1 = x + z.$  (We do not change the value of $y.$)  Note that
\begin{align*}
xyz - x_1 yz_1 &= y \left( xz - \frac{x + z}{3} \cdot \frac{2x + 2z}{3} \right) \\
&= y \cdot \frac{(2z - x)(2x - z)}{9} > 0.
\end{align*}This means that if $z < 2x,$ and we replace $x$ with $x_1$ and $z$ with $z_1,$ the value of the product $xyz$ decreases
(The condition $x + y + z = 1$ still holds.)  So, to find the minimum of $xyz,$ we can restrict our attention to triples $(x,y,z)$ where $z = 2x.$
Our three numbers are then $x \le y \le 2x.$  Since the three numbers add up to 1, $3x + y = 1,$ so $y = 1 - 3x.$  Then
\[x \le 1 - 3x \le 2x,\]so $\frac{1}{5} \le x \le \frac{1}{4}.$
We want to minimize
\[xyz = x(1 - 3x)(2x) = 2x^2 (1 - 3x).\]This product is $\frac{4}{125}$ at $x = \frac{1}{5},$ and $\frac{1}{32}$ at $x = \frac{1}{4}.$  We can verify that the minimum value is $\frac{1}{32},$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
2x^2 (1 - 3x) - \frac{1}{32} &= -\frac{192x^3 - 64x^2 + 1}{32} \\
&= \frac{(1 - 4x)(48x^2 - 4x - 1)}{32}.
\end{align*}Clearly $1 - 4x \ge 0,$ and both roots of $48x^2 - 4x - 1$ are less than $\frac{1}{5}.$  Therefore,
\[2x^2 (1 - 3x) - \frac{1}{32} = \frac{(1 - 4x)(48x^2 - 4x - 1)}{32} \ge 0\]for $\frac{1}{5} \le x \le \frac{1}{4},$ and equality occurs when $x = \frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the minimum value is $\boxed{\frac{1}{32}}.$
Let $p(x) = x^2-4x+3$
A number $c$ is not in the domain of $g$ if and only if $p(c) = 0$
Hence we have,
$$c^2-4c+3=0.$$Factoring gives us
$$(c-3)(c-1) = 0.$$Solving for $c$ gives us $1$ and $3$
Hence the domain of $g$ is $\boxed{(-\infty, 1) \cup (1, 3) \cup (3, \infty)} $.
Using the Remainder Theorem, the remainder when $f(x) = x^4-7x^3+9x^2+16x-13$ is divided by $x - 3$ is
$$\begin{aligned} f(3)&=3^4-7\cdot3^3+9\cdot3^2+16\cdot3-13 \\&= 3^3(3-7+3) + 35\\ &= \boxed{8}
\end{aligned}$$
We have that
\begin{align*}
x^2 - y^2 &= (x + y)(x - y) \\
&= 2 \cdot 2001^{1002} \cdot (-2 \cdot 2001^{-1002}) \\
&= \boxed{-4}.
\end{align*}
Let $\alpha = x + yi$ and $\beta = x - yi.$  Then from $|\alpha - \beta| = 2 \sqrt{3},$ $2|y| = 2 \sqrt{3},$ so $|y| = \sqrt{3}.$
Now, $\frac{\alpha}{\beta^2}$ is real
Since $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex conjugates, $\alpha^2 \beta^2$ is real, so $\frac{\alpha}{\beta^2} \cdot \alpha^2 \beta^2 = \alpha^3$ is real
\[\alpha^3 = (x + yi)^3 = (x^3 - 3xy^2) + (3x^2 y - y^3) i,\]so $3x^2 y - y^3 = 0,$ or $y(3x^2 - y^2) = 0.$  Since $|y| = \sqrt{3},$ $y \neq 0,$ so $3x^2 = y^2 = 3,$ which means $x^2 = 1.$  Therefore,
\[|\alpha| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{1 + 3} = \boxed{2}.\]
By AM-GM-HM,
\[A_1 \ge G_ 1 \ge H_1.\]Since $x$ and $y$ are distinct, equality cannot occur, so $A_1 > G_1 > H_1.$  Note that $G_1 = \sqrt{xy},$ and
\[A_1 H_1 = \frac{x + y}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y}} = \frac{x + y}{2} \cdot \frac{4xy}{x + y} = xy,\]so $G_1^2 = A_1 H_1.$
Now, suppose $A_n > G_n > H_n$ for some positive integer $n,$ and that $G_n^2 = A_n H_n.$  Then by AM-GM-HM, $A_{n + 1} > G_{n + 1} > H_{n + 1}.$  Also,
\[A_{n + 1} = \frac{A_n + H_n}{2} < \frac{A_n + A_n}{2} = A_n.\]Also,
\[G_{n + 1} = \sqrt{A_n H_n} = G_n,\]and
\[H_{n + 1} = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{A_n} + \frac{1}{H_n}} > \frac{2}{\frac{1}{H_n} + \frac{1}{H_n}} = H_n.\]Also, by the same calculation as above, we can verify that $G_{n + 1}^2 = A_{n + 1} H_{n + 1}.$
Then by induction, we can say that
\[A_{n + 1} < A_n, \quad G_{n + 1} = G_n, \quad H_{n + 1} > H_n\]for all positive integers $n.$  Hence, the statements that are true are 1, 16, and 256, and their sum is $\boxed{273}.$
By the Triangle Inequality,
\[|z - 12| + |z - 5i| = |z - 12| + |5i - z| \ge |(z - 12) + (5i - z)| = |-12 + 5i| = 13.\]But we are told that $|z - 12| + |z - 5i| = 13.$  The only way that equality can occur is if $z$ lies on the line segment connecting 12 and $5i$ in the complex plane.
unitsize(0.4 cm);
pair Z = interp((0,5),(12,0),0.6);
pair P = ((0,0) + reflect((12,0),(0,5))*(0,0))/2;

draw((-1,0)--(13,0));

[/asy]
We want to minimize $|z|$
We see that $|z|$ is minimized when $z$ coincides with the projection of the origin onto the line segment.
The area of the triangle with vertices 0, 12, and $5i$ is
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 \cdot 5 = 30.\]This area is also
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot 13 \cdot h = \frac{13h}{2},\]so $h = \boxed{\frac{60}{13}}.$
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(x + y + z) \left( \frac{4}{x} + \frac{9}{y} + \frac{16}{z} \right) \ge (2 + 3 + 4)^2 = 81,\]so
\[\frac{4}{x} + \frac{9}{y} + \frac{16}{z} \ge \frac{81}{3} = 27.\]Equality occurs when $\frac{x^2}{4} = \frac{y^2}{9} = \frac{z^2}{16}.$  Along with the condition $x + y + z = 3,$ we can solve to get $x = \frac{2}{3},$ $y = 1,$ and $z = \frac{4}{3},$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{27}.$
By Vieta's formulas, we know that \[\begin{aligned} a+b+c &= \frac12, \\ ab+bc+ca &= \frac42 = 2, \\ abc &= -\frac{10}2 = -5
\end{aligned}\]We square both sides of $a+b+c=\frac12,$ which will produce the terms $a^2+b^2+c^2$: \[(a+b+c)^2 = a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca = \frac14.\]Substituting $ab+bc+ca=2,$ we have \[a^2+b^2+c^2+2(2)=\frac14,\]so \[a^2+b^2+c^2=\frac14-4=\boxed{-\frac{15}4}.\]
Let $n = \lfloor x \rfloor$ and $a = \{x\}.$ Then, we have \[\begin{aligned} \lfloor x^2 \rfloor &= \lfloor (n+a)^2 \rfloor \\& = \lfloor n^2 + 2na + a^2 \rfloor \\ &= n^2 + \lfloor 2na + a^2 \rfloor \end{aligned}\]because $n^2$ is an integer
We are given that $\lfloor x^2 \rfloor - n^2 = 17,$ so we have the equation \[\lfloor 2na + a^2 \rfloor = 17.\]That is, \[17 \le 2na + a^2 < 18.\]Since $0 \le a < 1,$ we have $2na + a^2 < 2n + 1,$ so $17 < 2n+1,$ and $n > 8.$ Therefore, the smallest possible value for $n$ is $n = 9.$ To minimize $x,$ we should minimize $n,$ so take $n = 9.$ This gives \[17 \le 18a + a^2 < 18.\]Then $0 \le a^2 + 18a - 17.$ The roots of $a^2 + 18a - 17 = 0$ are \[a = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{18^2 + 4 \cdot 17}}{2} = -9 \pm 7\sqrt{2},\]and since $a \ge 0,$ we must have $a \ge -9 + 7\sqrt{2}.$ Hence, \[x = n + a \ge 9 + (-9 + 7\sqrt2) = 7\sqrt2.\]Indeed, $x=7\sqrt2$ is a solution to the equation, because \[\lfloor x^2 \rfloor - \lfloor x \rfloor^2 = \lfloor 98 \rfloor - \lfloor 9 \rfloor^2 = 98 - 9^2 = 17,\]so the answer is $\boxed{7\sqrt2}.$
We have that $x^2 = \frac{\sqrt{53}}{2} + \frac{3}{2}.$  Then $2x^2 = \sqrt{53} + 3,$ so $2x^2 - 3 = \sqrt{53}.$  Squaring both sides, we get
\[4x^4 - 12x^2 + 9 = 53,\]so $4x^4 = 12x^2 + 44.$  Then $x^4 = 3x^2 + 11.$
Since $x \neq 0,$ we can divide both sides of the given equation by $x^{40},$ to get
\[x^{60} = 2x^{58} + 14x^{56} + 11x^{54} - x^{10} + ax^6 + bx^4 + c.\]Now,
\begin{align*}
x^{60} - 2x^{58} - 14x^{56} - 11x^{54} &= x^{54} (x^6 - 2x^4 - 14x^2 - 11) \\
&= x^{54} ((x^2 - 2) x^4 - 14x^2 - 11) \\
&= x^{54} ((x^2 - 2)(3x^2 + 11) - 14x^2 - 11) \\
&= x^{54} (3x^4 - 9x^2 - 33) \\
&= 3x^{54} (x^4 - 3x^2 - 11) \\
\end{align*}So, the equation reduces to
\[x^{10} = ax^6 + bx^4 + c.\]We have that
\begin{align*}
x^6 &= x^2 \cdot x^4 = x^2 (3x^2 + 11) = 3x^4 + 11x^2 = 3(3x^2 + 11) + 11x^2 = 20x^2 + 33, \\
x^8 &= x^2 \cdot x^6 = x^2 (20x^2 + 33) = 20x^4 + 33x^2 = 20(3x^2 + 11) + 33x^2 = 93x^2 + 220, \\
x^{10} &= x^2 \cdot x^8 = x^2 (93x^2 + 220) = 93x^4 + 220x^2 = 93(3x^2 + 11) + 220x^2 = 499x^2 + 1023.
\end{align*}Thus, $x^{10} = ax^6 + bx^4 + c$ becomes
\[499x^2 + 1023 = a(20x^2 + 33) + b(3x^2 + 11) + c.\]Then
\[499x^2 + 1023 = (20a + 3b)x^2 + (33a + 11b + c).\]Since $x^2$ is irrational, we want $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ to satisfy $20a + 3b = 499$ and $33a + 11b + c = 1023.$  Solving for $a$ and $b,$ we find
\[a = \frac{3c + 2420}{121}, \quad b = \frac{3993 - 20c}{121}.\]Hence, $c < \frac{3993}{20},$ which means $c \le 199.$  Also, we want $3c + 2420$ to be divisible by 121  Since 2420 is divisible by 121, $c$ must be divisible by 121
Therefore, $c = 121,$ which implies $a = 23$ and $b = 13,$ so $a + b + c = \boxed{157}.$
Setting $x = 3,$ we get
\[f(3) + 2f(-2) = 27.\]Setting $x = -2,$ we get
\[f(-2) + 2f(3) = 12.\]Solving these equations as a system in $f(3)$ and $f(-2),$ we find $f(3) = \boxed{-1}$ and $f(-2) = 14.$
Let the roots of $x^3+Ax+10$ be $p$, $q$, and $r$, and let the roots of $x^3+Bx^2+50=0$ be $p$, $q$, and $s$
By Vieta's formulas,
\begin{align*}
p + q + r &= 0, \\
pqr &= -10, \\
pq + ps + qs &= 0, \\
pqs &= -50.
\end{align*}From the equation $p + q + r = 0,$ we conclude that $ps + qs + rs = 0.$  Subtracting the equation $pq + ps + qs = 0,$ we get $pq - rs = 0,$ so $pq = rs.$
\[(pq)^3 = (pq)(pq)(rs) = (pqr)(pqs) = (-10)(-50) = 500.\]Therefore, $pq = \sqrt[3]{500} = 5 \sqrt[3]{4}$
The final answer is $5 + 3 + 4 = \boxed{12}.$
From the given equations,
\begin{align*}
(x - 3) &= \pm (y - 9), \\
(x - 9) &= \pm 2 (y - 3).
\end{align*}Thus, we divide into cases.
Case 1: $x - 3 = y - 9$ and $x - 9 = 2(y - 3).$
Solving this system, we find $(x,y) = (-15,-9).$
Case 2: $x - 3 = y - 9$ and $x - 9 = -2(y - 3).$
Solving this system, we find $(x,y) = (1,7).$
Case 3: $x - 3 = -(y - 9)$ and $x - 9 = 2(y - 3).$
Solving this system, we find $(x,y) = (9,3).$
Case 4: $x - 3 = -(y - 9)$ and $x - 9 = -2(y - 3).$
Solving this system, we find $(x,y) = (9,3).$
Hence, the solutions $(x,y)$ are $(-15,-9),$ $(1,7),$ and $(9,3).$  The final answer is $(-15) + (-9) + 1 + 7 + 9 + 3 = \boxed{-4}.$
We divide the two given polynomials to obtain \[
\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{x^3} & +3x^2 & +9x & +28 & +\frac{86}{x-3} \\
\cline{2-6}

\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & &-28x & +84 \\ \cline{5-6}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & & & 86, \\
\end{array}
\]which shows that the remainder is $\boxed{86}$
Alternatively, we could use the remainder theorem, which states that the remainder when a polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $x-a$, the remainder is $p(a)$
We find that the remainder is $3^4+3+2=86$.
Let $a = \sqrt[4]{47 - 2x}$ and $b = \sqrt[4]{35 + 2x}.$  Then $a + b = 4.$  Also,
\[a^4 + b^4 = (47 - 2x) + (35 + 2x) = 82.\]Since $a + b = 4,$ there exists a $t$ such that $a = 2 + t$ and $b = 2 - t.$  Then
\[a^4 + b^4 = (2 + t)^4 + (2 - t)^4 = 2t^4 + 48t^2 + 32 = 82.\]This simplifies to $t^4 + 24t^2 - 25 = 0$, which factors as $(t^2 - 1)(t^2 + 25) = 0.$  Hence, $t = \pm 1.$
If $t = 1,$ then $a = \sqrt[4]{47 - 2x} = 3,$ which leads to $x = -17.$  If $t = -1,$ then $a = \sqrt[4]{47 - 2x} = 1,$ which leads to $x = 23.$  Thus, the solutions are $\boxed{23,-17}.$  We check that these solutions works.
Cubing the equation $z = x + yi,$ we get
\begin{align*}
z^3 &= (x + yi)^3 \\
&= x^3 + 3x^2 yi + 3xy^2 i^2 + y^3 i^3 \\
&= x^3 + 3x^2 yi - 3xy^2 - y^3 i \\
&= (x^3 - 3xy^2) + (3x^2 y - y^3)i.
\end{align*}Hence, $x^3 - 3xy^2 = -74.$  We then have
\[x(x^2 - 3y^2) = -74.\]Thus, $x$ must be a divisor of 74, which means $x$ must be 1, 2, 37, or 74
Checking these values, we find that the equation $x(x^2 - 3y^2) = -74$ has an integer solution in $y$ only when $x = 1,$ and that integer solution is $y = 5.$  Therefore, $z = \boxed{1 + 5i}.$
Let $g(x) = f(x) + x^2.$  Then $g(x)$ is also a monic quartic polynomial, and $g(-1) = g(2) = g(-3) = f(4) = 0,$ so
\[g(x) = (x + 1)(x - 2)(x + 3)(x - 4).\]Hence, $f(x) = (x + 1)(x - 2)(x + 3)(x - 4) - x^2.$  In particular, $f(1) = (2)(-1)(4)(-3) - 1 = \boxed{23}.$
From the formula for an infinite geometric series,
\[\frac{a/b}{1 - 1/b} = 4.\]Then $\frac{a}{b - 1} = 4,$ so $a = 4(b - 1).$
Again from the formula,
\begin{align*}
\frac{a}{a + b} + \frac{a}{(a + b)^2} + \frac{a}{(a + b)^3} + \dotsb &= \frac{a/(a + b)}{1 - 1/(a + b)} \\
&= \frac{a}{a + b - 1} \\
&= \frac{4(b - 1)}{4(b - 1) + (b - 1)} \\
&= \frac{4(b - 1)}{5(b - 1)} = \boxed{\frac{4}{5}}.
\end{align*}
If $p$ is a root of $x^3 - x^2 + x - 2 = 0$, then $p^3 - p^2 + p - 2 = 0$, or
\[p^3 = p^2 - p + 2.\]Similarly, $q^3 = q^2 - q + 2$, and $r^3 = r^2 - r + 2$, so
\[p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (p^2 + q^2 + r^2) - (p + q + r) + 6.\]By Vieta's formulas, $p + q + r = 1$, $pq + pr + qr = 1$, and $pqr = 2$
Squaring the equation $p + q + r = 1$, we get
\[p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2pq + 2pr + 2qr = 1.\]Subtracting $2pq + 2pr + 2qr = 2$, we get
\[p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = -1.\]Therefore, $p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (p^2 + q^2 + r^2) - (p + q + r) + 6 = (-1) - 1  + 6 = \boxed{4}$.
Expanding, we get \[(a+b)^2+(b+c)^2+(c+a)^2 = 2(a^2+b^2+c^2) + 2(ab+bc+ca).\]To compute this expression, note that \[(a+b+c)^2 = (a^2+b^2+c^2) + 2(ab+bc+ca).\]Then we can write the given expression in terms of $a+b+c$ and $ab+bc+ca$: \[\begin{aligned} 2(a^2+b^2+c^2) + 2(ab+bc+ca) &=[2(a^2+b^2+c^2) + 4(ab+bc+ca)] - 2(ab+bc+ca) \\ &=  2(a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab+bc+ca)
\end{aligned}\]By Vieta's formulas, $a+b+c=20$ and $ab+bc+ca=18$, so the answer is $2 \cdot 20^2 - 2 \cdot 18 = \boxed{764}.$
By Vieta's, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the solutions to the cubic equation  \[x^3 - 2x^2 - 7x + 14 = 0.\] We group and factor as follows: \begin{align*}
x^3 - 2x^2 - 7x + 14 = 0&=(x^3 - 7x) - (2x^2 - 14)\\
&=x(x^2 - 7) - 2(x^2 - 7)\\
&=(x-2)(x^2 - 7).
\end{align*} Thus, the three solutions are $x=2$, $x=\sqrt{7}$, and $x=-\sqrt{7}$
The largest of these numbers is $\boxed{\sqrt{7}}$.
We have that
\begin{align*}
u_2 &= -\frac{1}{a + 1}, \\
u_3 &= -\frac{1}{-\frac{1}{a + 1} + 1} = -\frac{a + 1}{a}, \\
u_4 &= -\frac{1}{-\frac{a + 1}{a} + 1} = a.
\end{align*}Since $u_4 = u_1,$ and each term depends only on the previous term, the sequence becomes periodic, with a period of length 3
Hence, $u_{16} = u_1 = \boxed{a}.$
We re-write the given recursion as
\[a_n = \frac{a_{n - 1}^2}{b_{n - 1}}, \quad b_n = \frac{b_{n - 1}^2}{a_{n - 1}}.\]Then
\[a_n b_n = \frac{a_{n - 1}^2}{b_n} \cdot \frac{b_{n - 1}^2}{a_n} = a_{n - 1} b_{n - 1}.\]Solving for $a_{n - 1}$ in $b_n = \frac{b_{n - 1}^2}{a_{n - 1}},$ we find $a_{n - 1} = \frac{b_{n - 1}^2}{b_n}.$  Then $a_n = \frac{b_n^2}{b_{n + 1}}.$  Substituting into the equation above, we get
\[\frac{b_n^2}{b_{n - 1}} \cdot b_n = \frac{b_{n - 1}^2}{b_{n + 1}} \cdot b_{n - 1}.\]Isolating $b_{n + 1},$ we find
\[b_{n + 1} = \frac{b_{n - 1}^4}{b_n^3}.\]We know that $b_0 = 3$ and $b_1 = \frac{b_0^2}{a_0} = \frac{9}{2}.$  Let
\[b_n = \frac{3^{s_n}}{2^{t_n}}.\]Then $s_0 = 1,$ $s_1 = 2,$ $t_0 = 0,$ and $t_1 = 1.$  From the equation $b_{n + 1} = \frac{b_{n - 1}^4}{b_n^3},$
\[\frac{3^{s_{n + 1}}}{2^{t_{n + 1}}} = \frac{\left( \dfrac{3^{s_n}}{2^{t_n}} \right)^4}{\left( \dfrac{3^{s_{n - 1}}}{2^{t_{n - 1}}} \right)^3} = \frac{3^{4s_n - 3s_{n - 1}}}{2^{4t_n - 3t_{n - 1}}},\]so $s_{n + 1} = 4s_n - 3s_{n - 1}$ and $t_{n + 1} = 4t_n - 3t_{n - 1}.$  We can then use these equations to crank out the first few terms with a table:
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
n & s_n & t_n \\ \hline
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 2 & 1 \\
2 & 5 & 4 \\
3 & 14 & 13 \\
4 & 41 & 40 \\
5 & 122 & 121 \\
6 & 365 & 364 \\
7 & 1094 & 1093 \\
8 & 3281 & 3280
\end{array}
\]Hence, $(m,n) = \boxed{(3281,3280)}.$
Let $b_n = a_n - 1.$  Then $b_ n = b_{n - 1}^2,$ and
\begin{align*}
a_0 a_1 a_2 \dotsm &= (1 + b_0)(1 + b_0^2)(1 + b_0^4) \dotsm \\
&= \frac{1 - b_0^2}{1 - b_0} \cdot \frac{1 - b_0^4}{1 - b_0^2} \cdot \frac{1 - b_0^8}{1 - b_0^4} \dotsm \\
&= \frac{1}{1 - b_0} = \frac{1}{1 - (-1/2)} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.
\end{align*}
By Vieta's formulas, $ab = 2.$  Then
\[q = \left( a + \frac{1}{b} \right) \left( b + \frac{1}{a} \right) = ab + 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{ab} = 2 + 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{9}{2}}.\]
Let $b_n = \frac{1}{1 - a_n}.$  Solving for $a_n,$ we find
\[a_n = \frac{b_n - 1}{b_n}.\]Substituting, we get
\[\left( \frac{b_n - 1}{b_n} \right)^{2018} + \left( \frac{b_n - 1}{b_n} \right)^{2017} + \dots + \left( \frac{b_n - 1}{b_n} \right)^2 + \frac{b_n - 1}{b_n} - 1345 = 0.\]Hence,
\[(b_n - 1)^{2018} + b_n (b_n - 1)^{2017} + \dots + b_n^{2016} (b_n - 1)^2 + b_n^{2017} (b_n - 1) - 1345 b_n^{2018} = 0.\]Thus, the $b_i$ are the roots of the polynomial
\[(x - 1)^{2018} + x(x - 1)^{2017} + \dots + x^{2016} (x - 1)^2 + x^{2017} (x - 1) - 1345x^{2018} = 0.\]The coefficient of $x^{2018}$ is $2019 - 1346 = 673.$  The coefficient of $x^{2017}$ is $-1 - 2 - \dots - 2018 = -\frac{2018 \cdot 2019}{2}.$  Therefore, the sum of the $b_i$ is
\[\frac{2018 \cdot 2019}{2 \cdot 673} = \boxed{3027}.\]
The function $f_{1}(x)=\sqrt{1-x}$ is defined when $x\leq1$
Next, we have \[f_{2}(x)=f_{1}(\sqrt{4-x})=\sqrt{1-\sqrt{4-x}}.\]For this to be defined, we must have $4-x\ge0$ or $x \le 4,$ and the number $\sqrt{4-x}$ must lie in the domain of $f_1,$ so $\sqrt{4-x} \le 1,$ or $x \ge 3.$ Thus, the domain of $f_2$ is $[3, 4].$
Similarly, for $f_3(x) = f_2\left(\sqrt{9-x}\right)$ to be defined, we must have $x \le 9,$ and the number $\sqrt{9-x}$ must lie in the interval $[3, 4].$ Therefore, \[3 \le \sqrt{9-x} \le 4.\]Squaring all parts of this inequality chain gives $9 \le 9-x \le 16,$ and so $-7 \le x \le 0.$ Thus, the domain of $f_3$ is $[-7, 0].$
Similarly, for $f_4(x) = f_3\left(\sqrt{16-x}\right)$ to be defined, we must have $x \le 16,$ and $\sqrt{16-x}$ must lie in the interval $[-7, 0].$ But $\sqrt{16-x}$ is always nonnegative, so we must have $\sqrt{16-x} = 0,$ or $x=16.$ Thus, the domain of $f_4$ consists of a single point $\{16\}.$
We see, then, that $f_5(x) = f_4\left(\sqrt{25-x}\right)$ is defined if and only if $\sqrt{25-x} = 16,$ or $x = 25 - 16^2 = -231.$ Therefore, the domain of $f_5$ is $\{-231\}.$
The domain of $f_6(x)$ is empty, because $\sqrt{36-x}$ can never equal a negative number like $-231.$ Thus, $N = 5$ and $c = \boxed{-231}.$
On day $n$, Barry increases the length of the object by a factor of $\frac{n+2}{n+1}$
Thus, the overall increase through day $n$ is by a factor of $\left( \frac32 \right) \left( \frac43\right) \cdots \left( \frac{n+1}{n}\right) \left( \frac{n+2}{n+1}\right)$
Canceling, we see that this expression equals $\frac{n+2}2$
Thus we have $\frac{n+2}2=100$, and so $n=\boxed{198}.$
From the equation $x^3 + 4x = 8,$ $x^3 = -4x + 8.$  Then
\begin{align*}
x^4 &= -4x^2 + 8x, \\
x^5 &= -4x^3 + 8x^2 = -4(-4x + 8) + 8x^2 = 8x^2 + 16x - 32, \\
x^6 &= 8x^3 + 16x^2 - 32x = 8(-4x + 8) + 16x^2 - 32x = 16x^2 - 64x + 64, \\
x^7 &= 16x^3 - 64x^2 + 64x = 16(-4x + 8) - 64x^2 + 64x = 128 - 64x^2.
\end{align*}Hence,
\[x^7 + 64x^2 = 128 - 64x^2 + 64x^2 = \boxed{128}.\]
By Vieta's Formulas, we know that $a$ is the sum of the three roots of the polynomial $x^3-ax^2+bx-2010$
Again Vieta's Formulas tells us that $2010$ is the product of the three integer roots
Also, $2010$ factors into $2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot67$
But, since there are only three roots to the polynomial, two of the four prime factors must be multiplied so that we are left with three roots
To minimize $a$, $2$ and $3$ should be multiplied, which means $a$ will be $6+5+67=\boxed{78}.$
By the formula given in the problem,
\[(10^{2002} + 1)^{10/7} = 10^{2860} + \frac{10}{7} \cdot 10^{858} + \frac{\frac{10}{7} \cdot \frac{3}{7}}{2} \cdot 10^{-1144} + \dotsb.\]The only term which affect the first few digits to the right of the decimal point in this number is
\[\frac{10}{7} \cdot 10^{858} = 10^{859} \cdot \frac{1}{7} = 10^{859} \cdot 0.142857142857 \dots.\]When 859 is divided by 6, the remainder is 1, so the portion after the decimal point is $0.428571 \dots.$  Hence, the first three digits are $\boxed{428}.$
We can build a sign chart:
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
& x < -3 & -3 < x < 0 & 0 < x \\ \hline
x + 3 & - & + & + \\
x & - & - & + \\
\frac{x}{x + 3} & + & - & +
\end{array}
\]Also, $\frac{x}{x + 3} = 0$ for $x = 0.$
Thus, the solution is $x \in \boxed{(-\infty,-3) \cup [0,\infty)}.$
We can substitute $x=y-1$ to obtain a polynomial having roots $a+1$, $b+1$, $c+1$, namely,
\[(y-1)^3-(y-1)+1=y^3-3y^2+2y+1.\]The sum of the reciprocals of the roots of this polynomial is, by Vieta's formulas, $\frac{2}{-1}=\boxed{-2}$.
Inverting each logarithm, we have \[\frac{1}{\log_{10} 10x^2} + \frac{1}{\log_{10} 100x^3} = -2,\]or \[\frac{1}{1 + 2\log_{10} x} + \frac{1}{2 + 3\log_{10} x} = -2.\]Now, make the substitution $y = \log_{10} x,$ giving \[\frac{1}{1+2y} +\frac{1}{2+3y}=-2.\]To solve this equation, we multiply both sides by $(1+2y)(2+3y)$ to get \[(2+3y)+(1+2y) = -2(1+2y)(2+3y),\]which rearranges to \[12y^2 + 19y + 7 = 0.\]Factoring this quadratic, we get \[(y+1)(12y+7) = 0,\]so either $y = -1$ or $y = -\tfrac{7}{12}.$ Since $y = \log_{10} x,$ we have $x = 10^y,$ so either $x = 10^{-1}$ or $x = 10^{-7/12}.$ The larger of these two solutions is $x = 10^{-7/12},$ so the answer is \[\frac{1}{x^{12}} = x^{-12} = 10^7 = \boxed{10000000}.\]
The function $f(x) = \sqrt{1 - \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3 - x}}}$ is defined only when
\[1 - \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3 - x}} \ge 0,\]or
\[\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3 - x}} \le 1
\quad (*)\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[2 - \sqrt{3 - x} \le 1.\]Then
\[\sqrt{3 - x} \ge 1.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[3 - x \ge 1,\]so $x \le 2.$
Also, for $(*)$ to hold, we must also have
\[2 - \sqrt{3 - x} \ge 0.\]Then $\sqrt{3 - x} \le 2.$  Squaring both sides, we get
\[3 - x \le 4,\]so $x \ge -1.$
Hence, the domain of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{[-1,2]}.$
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\left[ \sqrt{x(50 - x)} + \sqrt{(2 - x)x} \right]^2 \le [(x + (2 - x))((50 - x) + x)] = 100,\]so $f(x) \le 10.$
Equality occurs when
\[\frac{x}{2 - x} = \frac{50 - x}{x}.\]Cross-multiplying, we get $x^2 = (2 - x)(50 - x) = x^2 - 52x + 100,$ so $x = \frac{100}{52} = \frac{25}{13}.$
Thus, $(x_0,M) = \boxed{\left( \frac{25}{13}, 10 \right)}.$
\begin{array}{c|cc cc}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{x} & -5 \\
\cline{2-5}
x^2 + 5x + 1 & x^3& & &  \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{x^3} & +5x^2 & +x  \\
\cline{2-4}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & -5x^2 & -x & \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & -5x^2 & -25x & -5 \\
\cline{3-5}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 24x & +5 \\
\end{array}
\]Thus, the remainder is $\boxed{24x + 5}.$
We see that $2x^3 + bx + 7$ must be the product of $x^2 + px + 1$ and a linear factor
Furthermore, this linear factor must be $2x + 7,$ to make the cubic and constant coefficients match
\[(2x^3 + bx + 7) = (x^2 + px + 1)(2x + 7).\]Expanding, we get
\[2x^3 + bx + 7 = 2x^3 + (2p + 7) x^2 + (7p + 2) x + 7.\]Then $2p + 7 = 0$ and $7p + 2 = b.$  Solving, we find $p = -\frac{7}{2}$ and $b = \boxed{-\frac{45}{2}}.$
Recall that a parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus $F$ and the directrix
Completing the square on $x,$ we get
\[y = -2(x - 1)^2 - 6.\]To make the algebra a bit easier, we can find the directrix of the parabola $y = -2x^2,$ shift the parabola right by 1 unit to get $y = -2(x - 1)^2$ (which does not change the directrix), and then shift it downward 6 units to find the directrix of the parabola $y = -2(x - 1)^2 - 6.$
Since the parabola $y = -2x^2$ is symmetric about the $y$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(0,f).$  Let $y = d$ be the equation of the directrix.
unitsize(1.5 cm);
pair F, P, Q;
F = (0,-1/4);
P = (1,-1);
Q = (1,1/4);

Let $(x,-2x^2)$ be a point on the parabola $y = -2x^2.$  Then
\[PF^2 = x^2 + (-2x^2 - f)^2\]and $PQ^2 = (-2x^2 - d)^2.$  Thus,
\[x^2 + (-2x^2 - f)^2 = (-2x^2 - d)^2.\]Expanding, we get
\[x^2 + 4x^4 + 4fx^2 + f^2 = 4x^4 + 4dx^2 + d^2.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
1 + 4f &= 4d, \\
f^2 &= d^2.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $d - f = \frac{1}{4}.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $2d = \frac{1}{4},$ so $d = \frac{1}{8}.$
Thus, the equation of the directrix of $y = -2x^2$ is $y = \frac{1}{8},$ so the equation of the directrix of $y = -2(x - 1)^2 - 6$ is $\boxed{y = -\frac{47}{8}}.$
Using the difference of squares factorization, we have \[\begin{aligned} N &= (100^2-98^2) + (99^2-97^2) + (96^2-94^2) + (95^2-93^2) + \dots + (4^2-2^2) + (3^2-1^2) \\ &= 2(100 + 98) + 2(99 + 97) + 2(96 + 94) + 2(95 + 93) + \dots + 2(4 + 2) + 2(3+1) \\ &= 2(1 + 2 + \dots + 100) \\ &= 2 \cdot \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} \\ &= \boxed{10100}.\end{aligned}\]
The first quadratic factors as \[(2x-5)(x+11) = 0,\]so its roots are $\tfrac52$ and $-11.$ Since $\lfloor c \rfloor$ must be an integer, it must be the case that $\lfloor c \rfloor = -11.$
The second quadratic factors as \[(3x-1)(2x-7) = 0,\]so its roots are $\tfrac13$ and $\tfrac72.$ Since $0 \le \{c\} < 1,$ it must be the case that $\{c\} = \tfrac13.$
Then $c = \lfloor c\rfloor + \{c\} = -11 + \tfrac13 = \boxed{-\tfrac{32}{3}}.$
Expanding, we have \[(1+r)(1+s)(1+t) = 1 + (r+s+t) + (rs+st+tr) + rst.\]By Vieta's formulas, this comes out to \[1 + 20 + 18 + 7 = \boxed{46}.\]
We look for integers $a$ and $b$ such that \[\sqrt{37-20\sqrt3} = a-b\sqrt3.\]Squaring both sides, we have $37-20\sqrt3=(a-b\sqrt3)^2 = (a^2+3b^2) - 2ab\sqrt3.$ Therefore, we must have \[\begin{aligned} a^2+3b^2 &= 37, \\ -2ab &= -20
\end{aligned}\]The second equation gives $ab=10.$ Trying the factor pairs of $10,$ we find that $(a,b)=(5,2)$ satisfies $a^2+3b^2=37.$ Therefore, $(37-20\sqrt3)=(5-2\sqrt3)^2.$ Since $5-2\sqrt3 \ge 0,$ it follows that \[\sqrt{37-20\sqrt3} = \boxed{5-2\sqrt3}.\]
Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are integers
\begin{align*}
z \overline{z}^3 + \overline{z} z^3 &= z \overline{z} (z^2 + \overline{z}^2) \\
&= |z|^2 ((x + yi)^2 + (x - yi)^2) \\
&= (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + 2xyi - y^2 + x^2 - 2xyi - y^2) \\
&= (x^2 + y^2)(2x^2 - 2y^2) = 350,
\end{align*}so $(x^2 + y^2)(x^2 - y^2) = 175.$
Since $x^2 + y^2$ is positive, $x^2 - y^2$ is also positive
So we seek the ways to write 175 as the product of two positive integers
Also, $x^2 + y^2 > x^2 - y^2,$ which gives us the following ways:
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
x^2 + y^2 & x^2 - y^2 & x^2 & y^2 \\ \hline
175 & 1 & 88 & 87 \\
35 & 5 & 20 & 15 \\
25 & 7 & 16 & 9
\end{array}
\]The only possibility is $x^2 = 16$ and $y^2 = 9.$  Then $x = \pm 4$ and $y = \pm 3,$ so the four complex numbers $z$ are $4 + 3i,$ $4 - 3i,$ $-4 + 3i,$ and $-4 - 3i.$  When we plot these in the complex plane, we get a rectangle whose dimensions are 6 and 8.
unitsize(0.5 cm);
pair A, B, C, D;
A = (4,3);
B = (4,-3);
C = (-4,-3);
D = (-4,3);
draw(A--B--C--D--cycle);
dot("$4 + 3i$", A, NE);
dot("$4 - 3i$", B, SE);
dot("$-4 - 3i$", C, SW);
dot("$-4 + 3i$", D, NW);
[/asy]
The area of this rectangle is $6 \cdot 8 = \boxed{48}.$
Expanding, we get
\begin{align*}
3k + j + (k + j)^2 &= 3k + j + k^2 + 2kj + j^2 \\
&= k(k + 3) + 2kj + j(j + 1).
\end{align*}For each integer $k,$ either $k$ or $k + 3$ is even, so $k(k + 3)$ is always even
Similarly, either $j$ or $j + 1$ is even, so $j(j + 1)$ is always even
Thus, $3k + j + (k + j)^2$ is always even.
We claim that for any nonnegative integer $n,$ there exist unique nonnnegative integers $j$ and $k$ such that
\[3k  + j + (k + j)^2 = 2n.\]Let $a = k + j,$ so
\[3k + j + (k + j)^2 = 2k + (k + j) + (k + j)^2 = a^2 + a + 2k.\]For a fixed value of $a,$ $k$ can range from 0 to $a,$ so $a^2 + a + 2k$ takes on all even integers from $a^2 + a$ to $a^2 + a + 2a = a^2 + 3a.$
Furthermore, for $k + j = a + 1,$
\[3k + j + (k + j)^2 = (a + 1)^2 + (a + 1) + 2k = a^2 + 3a + 2 + 2k\]takes on all even integers from $a^2 + 3a + 2$ to $a^2 + 3a + 2 + 2(a + 1) = a^2 + 5a + 4,$ and so on
Thus, for different values of $a = k + j,$ the possible values of $3k + j + (k + j)^2$ do not overlap, and it takes on all even integers exactly once.
Therefore,
\[\sum_{j = 0}^\infty \sum_{k = 0}^\infty 2^{-3k - j - (k + j)^2} = \sum_{i = 0}^\infty 2^{-2i} = \boxed{\frac{4}{3}}.\]
Note that
\begin{align*}
f(x) + f(-x) &= (ax^7 + bx^3 + cx - 5) + (a(-x)^7 + b(-x)^3 + c(-x) - 5) \\
&= (ax^7 + bx^3 + cx - 5) + (-ax^7 - bx^3 - cx - 5) \\
&= -10.
\end{align*}In particular, $f(7) + f(-7) = -10,$ so $f(7) = -10 - f(-7) = \boxed{-17}.$
If $2+\sqrt{2}$ is the root of a polynomial with rational coefficients, then so is $2-\sqrt{2}$
Their sum is $4$ and their product is $(2+\sqrt{2})(2-\sqrt{2}) = 4-2=2.$ Thus, the monic quadratic with roots $2+\sqrt{2}$ and $2-\sqrt{2}$ is $x^2-4x+2$.
If $1-\sqrt{3}$ is the root of a polynomial with rational coefficients, then so is $1+\sqrt{3}$
Their sum is $2$ and their product is $(1-\sqrt{3})(1+\sqrt{3}) = 1-3=-2.$ Thus, the monic quadratic with roots $1-\sqrt{3}$ and $1+\sqrt{3}$ is $x^2-2x-2$.
Thus, the monic quartic with roots $2+\sqrt{2}$ and $1-\sqrt{3}$ is
$$(x^2-4x+2)(x^2-2x-2) = \boxed{x^4-6x^3+8x^2+4x-4}.$$
The $200$ numbers sum up to $10{,}000$, so their average is $\frac{10{,}000}{200} = 50$.
Then we can represent the sequence as
$$50-199d,50-197d,\dots,50-d, 50+d, 50 + 3d ,\dots,50 + 197d , 50+199d.$$Since all the terms are at least 10, in particular the first and last term of the sequence, we know $50-199d \ge 10$  and $50+199d \ge 10$.
This means $50 - 199|d| \ge 10$ so $|d| \le \frac{40}{199}$ which means $d$ is at most $\frac{40}{199}$ and at least $-\frac{40}{199}$.
The 50th term is $50-101d$.
$$L = 50-101\times\frac{40}{199} = 50 - \frac{4040}{199}$$$$G = 50- 101\times \left(-\frac{40}{199}\right) = 50 + \frac{4040}{199}$$We can check that both of these sequences meet all the conditions of the problem (the lower bound, upper bound, and total sum).
Hence, $G-L = 2 \times \frac{4040}{199} = \boxed{\frac{8080}{199}}$.
Note: The condition that each term is at most 100 is unnecessary in solving the problem!  We can see this when we apply the condition to the first and last term (similar to when we applied the condition that all terms are at least 10), $50-199d \le 100$  and $50+199d \le 100$ which means $50 + 199|d| \le 100$ so $|d| \le \frac{50}{199}$ which is a higher bound than we already have.
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of $p(x)$ is 0, so the third root is $t = -r - s.$  Also,
\[a = rs + rt + st.\]The sum of the roots of $q(x)$ is also 0, so the third root is $-(r + 4) - (s - 3) = -r - s - 1 = t - 1.$  Also,
\[a = (r + 4)(s - 3) + (r + 4)(t - 1) + (s - 3)(t - 1).\]Hence,
\[rs + rt + st = (r + 4)(s - 3) + (r + 4)(t - 1) + (s - 3)(t - 1).\]This simplifies to $t = 4r - 3s + 13.$
Also, $b = -rst$ and
\[b + 240 = -(r + 4)(s - 3)(t - 1).\]Hence,
\[-rst + 240 = (r + 4)(s - 3)(t - 1).\]Substituting $t = 4r - 3s + 13,$ we get
\[-rs(4r - 3s + 13) + 240 = -(r + 4)(s - 3)(4r - 3s + 12).\]This simplifies to
\[r^2 - 2rs + s^2 + 7r - 7s - 8 = 0.\]Then $(r - s)^2 + 7(r - s) - 8 = 0,$ which factors as
\[(r - s - 1)(r - s + 8) = 0.\]Thus, $r - s = 1$ or $r - s = -8.$
If $r - s = 1,$ then $s = r - 1,$ and
\[t = 4t - 3s + 13 = r + 16.\]But $r + s + t = 0,$ so $r + (r - 1) + (r + 16) = 0,$ which leads to $r = -5.$  Then $s = -6$ and $t = 11,$ and $b = -rst = -330.$
If $r - s = -8,$ then $s = r + 8,$ and
\[t = 4t - 3s + 13 = r - 11.\]But $r + s + t = 0,$ so $r + (r + 8) + (r - 11) = 0,$ which leads to $r = 1.$  Then $s = 9$ and $t = -10,$ and $b = -rst = 90.$
Thus, the possible values of $b$ are $\boxed{-330,90}.$
The $n$th term is
\[\frac{1}{[(n - 1) a - (n - 2) b][na - (n - 1) b]}.\]We can write
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{[(n - 1) a - (n - 2) b][na - (n - 1) b]} &= \frac{a - b}{(a - b)[(n - 1) a - (n - 2) b][na - (n - 1) b]} \\
&= \frac{[na - (n - 1) b] - [(n - 1) a - (n - 2) b]}{(a - b)[(n - 1) a - (n - 2) b][na - (n - 1) b]} \\
&= \frac{1}{(a - b)[(n - 1)a - (n - 2)b]} - \frac{1}{(a - b)[na - (n - 1)b]}.
\end{align*}Thus,
\begin{align*}
&\frac{1}{ba} + \frac{1}{a(2a - b)} + \frac{1}{(2a - b)(3a - 2b)} + \frac{1}{(3a - 2b)(4a - 3b)} + \dotsb \\
&= \left( \frac{1}{(a - b)b} - \frac{1}{(a - b)a} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{(a - b)a} - \frac{1}{(a - b)(2a - b)} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{(a - b)(2a - b)} - \frac{1}{(a - b)(3a - 2b)} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \boxed{\frac{1}{(a - b)b}}.
\end{align*}
Instead of computing $A$ and $B$ separately, we can write a simple expression for $A-B,$ as follows: \[\begin{aligned} A - B &= (1 \cdot2 + 3 \cdot4 + 5 \cdot6 + \cdots + 37 \cdot38 + 39) - (1 + 2 \cdot3 + 4 \cdot5 + \cdots + 36 \cdot37 + 38 \cdot39) \\ &= -1 + (1 \cdot2 - 2 \cdot3) + (3 \cdot4 - 4 \cdot5) + \cdots + (37 \cdot 38 - 38 \cdot 39) + 39 \\ &= -1 + 2(-2) + 4(-2) + \cdots + 38(-2) + 39 \\ &= -1 - 2 \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{19 \cdot 20}{2} + 39 \\ &= -1 - 760 + 39 \\ &= -722
\end{aligned}\]Thus, $|A-B| = \boxed{722}.$
Let $f(x) = ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+bx+a$
Thus, the problem asserts that $x=2+i$ is a root of $f$.
Note the symmetry of the coefficients
In particular, we have $f\left(\frac 1x\right) = \frac{f(x)}{x^4}$ for all $x\ne 0$
Thus, if $x=r$ is any root of $f(x)$, then $x=\frac 1r$ is also a root.
In particular, $x=\frac 1{2+i}$ is a root
To write this root in standard form, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
$$\frac 1{2+i} = \frac 1{2+i}\cdot\frac{2-i}{2-i} = \frac{2-i}5 = \frac 25-\frac 15i.$$Now we have two nonreal roots of $f$
Since $f$ has real coefficients, the conjugates of its roots are also roots
Therefore, the four roots of $f$ are $2\pm i$ and $\frac 25\pm\frac 15i$.
The monic quadratic whose roots are $2\pm i$ is $(x-2-i)(x-2+i) = (x-2)^2-i^2 = x^2-4x+5$.
The monic quadratic whose roots are $\frac 25\pm\frac 15i$ is $\left(x-\frac 25-\frac 15i\right)\left(x-\frac 25+\frac 15i\right) = \left(x-\frac 25\right)^2-\left(\frac 15i\right)^2 = x^2-\frac 45x+\frac 15$.
Therefore,
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= a(x^2-4x+5)\left(x^2-\frac 45x+\frac 15\right) \\
&= a\left(x^4-\frac{24}5x^3+\frac{42}5x^2-\frac{24}5x+1\right),
\end{align*}so
$a,b,c$ are in the ratio $1:-\frac{24}5:\frac{42}5$
Since $a,b,c$ are integers whose greatest common divisor is $1$, we have $(a,b,c) = (5,-24,42)$ or $(-5,24,-42)$
In either case, $|c|=\boxed{42}$.
Suppose $f(z)=z^2+iz+1=c=a+bi$
We look for $z$ with $\text{Im}(z)>0$ such that $a,b$ are integers where $|a|, |b|\leq 10$.
First, use the quadratic formula:
$ z = \frac{1}{2} (-i \pm \sqrt{-1-4(1-c)}) = -\frac{i}{2} \pm \sqrt{ -\frac{5}{4} + c }$
Generally, consider the imaginary part of a radical of a complex number: $\sqrt{u}$, where $u = v+wi = r e^{i\theta}$.
$\Im (\sqrt{u}) = \Im(\pm \sqrt{r} e^{i\theta/2}) = \pm \sqrt{r} \sin(i\theta/2) = \pm \sqrt{r}\sqrt{\frac{1-\cos\theta}{2}} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{r-v}{2}}$.
Now let $u= -5/4 + c$, then $v = -5/4 + a$, $w=b$, $r=\sqrt{v^2 + w^2}$.
Note that $\Im(z)>0$ if and only if $\pm \sqrt{\frac{r-v}{2}}>\frac{1}{2}$
The latter is true only when we take the positive sign, and that $r-v > 1/2$,
or $v^2 + w^2 > (1/2 + v)^2 = 1/4 + v + v^2$, $w^2 > 1/4 + v$, or $b^2 > a-1$.
In other words, for all $z$, $f(z)=a+bi$ satisfies $b^2 > a-1$, and there is one and only one $z$ that makes it true
Therefore we are just going to count the number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ such that $a$, $b$ are integers of magnitude no greater than $10$, and that $b^2 \geq a$.
When $a\leq 0$, there is no restriction on $b$ so there are $11\cdot 21 = 231$ pairs;
when $a > 0$, there are $2(1+4+9+10+10+10+10+10+10+10)=2(84)=168$ pairs.
Thus there are $231+168=\boxed{399}$ numbers in total.
Let $t = z + \frac{1}{y}.$ Notice that \[\left(x+\frac{1}{z}\right)\left(y+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(z+\frac{1}{y}\right) = xyz + x+y+z + \frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{xyz}.\]Substituting known values, we have \[5 \cdot 29 \cdot t = 1 + (5 + 29 + t) + 1,\]or $145t = 36 + t.$ Thus, $t = \frac{36}{144} = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}\,.$
The roots of the corresponding equation $x^2 + bx + 2 = 0$ are
\[\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 8}}{2}.\](Note that these roots must be real, otherwise, the inequality $x^2 + bx + 2 \le 0$ has no real solutions.)  Thus, the solution to this inequality $x^2 + bx + 2 \le 0$ is
\[\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 8}}{2} \le x \le \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 8}}{2}.\]If the length of this interval is at least 4, then it must contain at least 4 integers, so the width of this interval must be less than 4
\[\sqrt{b^2 - 8} < 4.\]Then $b^2 - 8 < 16,$ so $b^2 < 24.$  We must also have $b^2 > 8.$  The only possible values of $b$ are then $-4,$ $-3,$ 3, and 4
We can look at each case.
\begin{array}{c|c}
b & \text{Integer solutions to $x^2 + bx + 2 \le 0$} \\ \hline
-4 & 1, 2, 3 \\
-3 & 1, 2 \\
3 & -2, -1 \\
4 & -3, -2, -1
\end{array}
\]Thus, there are $\boxed{2}$ values of $b$ that work, namely $-4$ and 4.
Since $a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0,$ $(a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = 0.$  This simplifies to $a^3 - b^3 = 0,$ so $a^3 = b^3.$
Then $b^9 = a^9.$  Also,
\[(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a^2 + ab + b^2) + ab = ab,\]so
\[(a + b)^3 = ab(a + b) = a(ab + b^2) = a(-a^2) = -a^3.\]Then $(a + b)^9 = (-a^3)^3 = -a^9,$ so
\[\frac{a^9 + b^9}{(a + b)^9} = \frac{2a^9}{-a^9} = \boxed{-2}.\]
We can try a few values to see if the function satisfies the properties
$f(1) = \log{1}$ and $f(-1) = \log (-1)$ which is not defined! Since to be even, $f(x) = f(-x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, $f$ is not even
For the same reason, $f$ is not odd
The answer is $\boxed{\text{neither}}.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
2x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 2x + 2y + 4 &= (x^2 + y^2 + 1 + 2x + 2y + 2xy) + (x^2 - 4x + 4) - 1 \\
&= (x + y + 1)^2 + (x - 2)^2 - 1.
\end{align*}Thus, the minimum value is $\boxed{-1},$ which occurs when $x + y + 1 = 0$ and $x - 2 = 0,$ or $x = 2$ and $y = -3.$
The discriminant of the quadratic is $3^2 - 4(-12)(-5) = -231,$ which is negative
Therefore, the quadratic $-12x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0$ has no real roots.
Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^2$ is $-12,$ which means that parabola is downward facing
Therefore, the inequalities is satisfied for all real numbers $x \in \boxed{(-\infty,\infty)}.$
From the equation $a + b + c = 0,$ $a = -b - c,$ so
\[\frac{1}{b^2 + c^2 - a^2} = \frac{1}{b^2 + c^2 - (b + c)^2} = \frac{1}{-2bc} = -\frac{1}{2bc}.\]Similarly,
\[\frac{1}{a^2 + c^2 - b^2} = -\frac{1}{2ac} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{a^2 + b^2 - c^2} = -\frac{1}{2ab},\]so
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{b^2 + c^2 - a^2} + \frac{1}{a^2 + c^2 - b^2} + \frac{1}{a^2 + b^2 - c^2} &= -\frac{1}{2bc} - \frac{1}{2ac} - \frac{1}{2ab} \\
&= -\frac{a + b + c}{2abc} = \boxed{0}.
\end{align*}
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the equation is $7.$ Furthermore, the only triple of distinct positive integers with a sum of $7$ is $\{1, 2, 4\}.$ To see this, note that the largest possible value for any of the three integers is $7 - 1 - 2 = 4,$ and the only way to choose three of the integers $1, 2, 3, 4$ to sum to $7$ is to choose $1,$ $2,$ and $4.$
Therefore, the roots of the equation must be $1,$ $2,$ and $4.$ It follows by Vieta that \[k = 1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 4 + 1 \cdot 4 = 14\]and \[m = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 = 8,\]so $k+m = 14+8 = \boxed{22}.$
Dividing the equation by $x^2,$ we get
\[6x^2 - 35x + 62 - \frac{35}{x} + \frac{6}{x^2} = 0.\]Let $y = x + \frac{1}{x}.$  Then
\[y^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2},\]so $x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = y^2 - 2.$  Thus, we can re-write the equation above as
\[6(y^2 - 2) - 35y + 62 = 0.\]This simplifies to $6y^2 - 35y + 50 = 0.$  The roots are $y = \frac{5}{2}$ and $y = \frac{10}{3}.$
The roots to
\[x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{5}{2}\]are 2 and $\frac{1}{2}.$  The roots to
\[x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{10}{3}\]are 3 and $\frac{1}{3}.$
Thus, the roots of $6x^4 - 35x^3 + 62x^2 - 35x + 6 = 0$ are $\boxed{2, 3, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}}.$
We have that
\[wx + xy + yz \le wx + xy + yz + zw = (w + y)(x + z).\]By AM-GM,
\[(w + y)(x + z) \le \left( \frac{(w + y) + (x + z)}{2} \right)^2 = 2500.\]Equality occurs when $w = x = 50$ and $y = z = 0,$ so the largest possible value is $\boxed{2500}.$
First, we reflect the graph in the $y$-axis
The corresponding function is $y = f(-x).$
unitsize(0.3 cm);
real func(real x) {
real y;
if (x >= -3 && x <= 0) {y = -2 - x;}
if (x >= 0 && x <= 2) {y = sqrt(4 - (x - 2)^2) - 2;}
if (x >= 2 && x <= 3) {y = 2*(x - 2);}
return(y);
real funcg (real x) {
return(func(-x));
int i, n;
for (i = -8; i <= 8; ++i) {
draw((i,-8)--(i,8),gray(0.7));
draw((-8,i)--(8,i),gray(0.7));
draw((-8,0)--(8,0),Arrows(6));
draw((0,-8)--(0,8),Arrows(6));
label("$x$", (8,0), E);
label("$y$", (0,8), N);
draw(graph(funcg,-3,3),red);
[/asy]
Then, we can shift the graph four units to the right
\[g(x) = f(-(x - 4)) = \boxed{f(4 - x)}.\]
Putting $\frac{x + y}{x - y} + \frac{x - y}{x + y}$ over a common denominator, we get
\[\frac{2x^2 + 2y^2}{x^2 - y^2} = 1.\]Then $2x^2 + 2y^2 = x^2 - y^2,$ so $x^2 = -3y^2.$
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^4 + y^4}{x^4 - y^4} + \frac{x^4 - y^4}{x^4 + y^4} &= \frac{9y^4 + y^4}{9y^4 - y^4} + \frac{9y^4 - y^4}{9y^4 + y^4} \\
&= \frac{10}{8} + \frac{8}{10} \\
&= \frac{5}{4} + \frac{4}{5} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{41}{20}}.
\end{align*}
Rationalizing the denominator, we get
\[\frac{1}{x - \sqrt{x^2 - 1}} = \frac{x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{(x - \sqrt{x^2 - 1})(x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1})} = \frac{x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{x^2 - (x^2 - 1)} = x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}.\]Thus, $2x + 2 \sqrt{x^2 - 1} = 20,$ so $x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1} = 10.$  Then $\sqrt{x^2 - 1} = 10 - x.$  Squaring both sides, we get
\[x^2 - 1 = 100 - 20x + x^2.\]Hence, $x = \frac{101}{20}.$
Similarly,
\[\frac{1}{x^2 + \sqrt{x^4 - 1}} = \frac{x^2 - \sqrt{x^4 - 1}}{(x^2 + \sqrt{x^4 - 1})(x^2 - \sqrt{x^4 - 1})} = \frac{x^2 - \sqrt{x^4 - 1}}{x^4 - (x^4 - 1)} = x^2 - \sqrt{x^4 - 1},\]so
\[x^2 + \sqrt{x^4 - 1} + \frac{1}{x^2 + \sqrt{x^4 - 1}} = 2x^2 = \boxed{\frac{10201}{200}}.\]
Since the vertex is at $\left(\frac{1}{4}, -\frac{9}{8}\right)$, the equation of the parabola can be expressed in the form
\[y=a\left(x-\frac{1}{4}\right)^2-\frac{9}{8}.\]Expanding, we find that
\[y=a\left(x^2-\frac{x}{2}+\frac{1}{16}\right)-\frac{9}{8} =ax^2-\frac{ax}{2}+\frac{a}{16}-\frac{9}{8}.\]From the problem, we know that the parabola can be expressed in the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$, where $a+b+c$ is an integer
From the above equation, we can conclude that $a=a$, $b = -\frac{a}{2}$, and $c = \frac{a}{16}-\frac{9}{8}$
Adding up all of these gives us
\[a + b + c = \frac{9a-18}{16} = \frac{9(a - 2)}{16}.\]Let $n = a + b + c.$  Then $\frac{9(a - 2)}{16} = n,$ so
\[a = \frac{16n + 18}{9}.\]For $a$ to be positive, we must have $16n + 18 > 0,$ or $n > -\frac{9}{8}.$  Setting $n = -1,$ we get $a = \frac{2}{9}.$
Thus, the smallest possible value of $a$ is $\boxed{\frac{2}{9}}.$
Setting $y = 0$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[f(0) + x = xf(0) + f(x),\]so $f(x) = (1 - f(0))x + f(0).$  This tells us that $f(x)$ is a linear function of the form $f(x) = mx + b.$  Since $f(-1) = 5,$ $5 = -m + b,$ so $b = m + 5,$ and
\[f(x) = mx + m + 5.\]Substituting this into the given functional equation, we get
\[mxy + m + 5 + x = x(my + m + 5) + mx + m + 5.\]This simplifies to $2mx = -4x.$  For this to hold for all $x,$ we must have $m = -2.$
Then $f(x) = -2x + 3.$  In particular, $f(-1001) = \boxed{2005}.$
Then the equation of the tangent at $A = (1,1)$ is of the form
\[y - 1 = m(x - 1),\]or $y = mx - m + 1.$  Substituting into $y = x^2,$ we get
\[mx - m + 1 = x^2.\]Then $x^2 - mx + m - 1 = 0.$  Since we have a tangent, this quadratic should have a double root
And since the $x$-coordinate of $A$ is $1,$ the double root is $x = 1.$  Hence, this quadratic is identical to $(x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1,$ which means $m = 2.$
Then the slope of the normal is $-\frac{1}{2},$ so the equation of the normal is
\[y - 1 = -\frac{1}{2} (x - 1).\]We want the intersection of the normal with $y = x^2,$ so we set $y = x^2$:
\[x^2 - 1 = -\frac{1}{2} (x - 1).\]We can factor the left-hand side:
\[(x - 1)(x + 1) = -\frac{1}{2} (x - 1).\]The solution $x = 1$ corresponds to the point $A.$  Otherwise, $x \neq 1,$ so we can divide both sides by $x - 1$:
\[x + 1 = -\frac{1}{2}.\]Hence, $x = -\frac{3}{2},$ so $B = \boxed{\left( -\frac{3}{2}, \frac{9}{4} \right)}.$
Let $S$ denote the given sum, so
\[S = \frac{x^2}{x - 1} + \frac{x^4}{x^2 - 1} + \dots + \frac{x^{4020}}{x^{2010} - 1} = \sum_{k = 1}^{2010} \frac{x^{2k}}{x^k - 1}
\tag{1}\]We can reverse the order of the terms, to get
\[S = \frac{x^{4020}}{x^{2010} - 1} + \frac{x^{4018}}{x^{2009} - 1} + \dots + \frac{x^2}{x - 1} = \sum_{k = 1}^{2010} \frac{x^{4022 - 2k}}{x^{2011 - k} - 1}.\]Since $x^{2011} = 1$,
\[\frac{x^{4022 - 2k}}{x^{2011 - k} - 1} = \frac{x^{-2k}}{x^{-k} - 1} = \frac{1}{x^k - x^{2k}} = \frac{1}{x^k (1 - x^k)},\]so
\[S = \sum_{k = 1}^{2010} \frac{1}{x^k (1 - x^k)}
\tag{2}\]Adding equations (1) and (2), we get
\begin{align*}
2S &= \sum_{k = 1}^{2010} \frac{x^{2k}}{x^k - 1} + \sum_{k = 1}^{2010} \frac{1}{x^k (1 - x^k)} \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^{2010} \left[ \frac{x^{2k}}{x^k - 1} + \frac{1}{x^k (1 - x^k)} \right] \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^{2010} \left[ \frac{x^{3k}}{x^k (x^k - 1)} - \frac{1}{x^k (x^k - 1)} \right] \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^{2010} \frac{x^{3k} - 1}{x^k (x^k - 1)}.
\end{align*}We can factor $x^{3k} - 1$ as $(x^k - 1)(x^{2k} + x^k + 1)$, so
\begin{align*}
2S &= \sum_{k = 1}^{2010} \frac{(x^k - 1)(x^{2k} + x^k + 1)}{x^k (x^k - 1)} \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^{2010} \frac{x^{2k} + x^k + 1}{x^k} \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^{2010} \left( x^k + 1 + \frac{1}{x^k} \right) \\
&= \left( x + 1 + \frac{1}{x} \right) + \left( x^2 + 1 + \frac{1}{x^2} \right) + \dots + \left( x^{2010} + 1 + \frac{1}{x^{2010}} \right) \\
&= (x + x^2 + \dots + x^{2010}) + 2010 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{x^{2010}}.
\end{align*}Since $x^{2011} = 1$, we have that $x^{2011} - 1 = 0$, which factors as
\[(x - 1)(x^{2010} + x^{2009} + \dots + x + 1) = 0.\]We know that $x \neq 1$, so we can divide both sides by $x - 1$, to get
\[x^{2010} + x^{2009} + \dots + x + 1 = 0.\]Then
\begin{align*}
2S &= (x + x^2 + \dots + x^{2010}) + 2010 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{x^{2010}} \\
&= (x + x^2 + \dots + x^{2010}) + 2010 + \frac{x^{2010} + x^{2009} + \dots + x}{x^{2011}} \\
&= (-1) + 2010 + \frac{-1}{1} \\
&= 2008,
\end{align*}so $S = \boxed{1004}$.
Since $x_1,$ $x_2,$ $x_3,$ $x_4,$ $x_5$ are the roots of $f(x) = x^5 + x^2 + 1,$ we can write
\[x^5 + x^2 + 1 = (x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)(x - x_4)(x - x_5).\]Also, $g(x) = x^2 - 2 = (x - \sqrt{2})(x + \sqrt{2}),$ so
\begin{align*}
&g(x_1) g(x_2) g(x_3) g(x_4) g(x_5) \\
&= (x_1 - \sqrt{2})(x_1 + \sqrt{2})(x_2 - \sqrt{2})(x_2 + \sqrt{2})(x_3 - \sqrt{2})(x_3 + \sqrt{2})(x_4 - \sqrt{2})(x_4 + \sqrt{2})(x_5 - \sqrt{2})(x_5 + \sqrt{2}) \\
&= (x_1 - \sqrt{2})(x_2 - \sqrt{2})(x_3 - \sqrt{2})(x_4 - \sqrt{2})(x_5 - \sqrt{2}) \\
&\quad \times (x_1 + \sqrt{2})(x_2 + \sqrt{2})(x_3 + \sqrt{2})(x_4 + \sqrt{2})(x_5 + \sqrt{2}) \\
&= (\sqrt{2} - x_1)(\sqrt{2} - x_2)(\sqrt{2} - x_3)(\sqrt{2} - x_4)(\sqrt{2} - x_5) \\
&\quad \times (-\sqrt{2} - x_1)(-\sqrt{2} - x_2)(-\sqrt{2} - x_3)(-\sqrt{2} - x_4)(-\sqrt{2} - x_5) \\
&= f(\sqrt{2}) f(-\sqrt{2}) \\
&= (4 \sqrt{2} + 2 + 1)(-4 \sqrt{2} + 2 + 1) \\
&= \boxed{-23}.
\end{align*}
Note that $(x - y) - (x + y) = xy - (x - y),$ which simplifies to $xy - x + 3y = 0.$  Solving for $x,$ we find
\[x = \frac{3y}{1 - y}.\]Also, $(x - y) - (x + y) = \frac{x}{y} - xy,$ which simplifies to
\[\frac{x}{y} - xy + 2y = 0.\]Substituting $x = \frac{3y}{1 - y},$ we get
\[\frac{3}{1 - y} - \frac{3y^2}{1 - y} + 2y = 0.\]This simplifies to $5y^2 - 2y - 3 = 0,$ which factors as $(y - 1)(5y + 3) = 0,$ so $y = 1$ or $y = -\frac{3}{5}.$
If $y = 1,$ then $x = \frac{3y}{1 - y}$ is not defined, so $y = -\frac{3}{5}.$  Then
\[x = \frac{3y}{1 - y} = \frac{3 (-3/5)}{1 + 3/5} = -\frac{9}{8}.\]Then the common difference of the arithmetic sequence is $(x - y) - (x + y) = -2y = \frac{6}{5},$ so the fifth term is
\[\frac{x}{y} + \frac{6}{5} = \frac{15}{8} + \frac{6}{5} = \boxed{\frac{123}{40}}.\]
Because the foci both lie on the line $x=5$ and the center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci, the center must also lie on the line $x=5.$ However, we also know that the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center
Therefore, the center of the hyperbola lies on both the line $x=5$ and the line $y=3x,$ so its coordinates are $(5, 15).$
Because the hyperbola has a horizontal axis, the other asymptote must have slope $-3.$ Therefore, we can write a point-slope equation for the other asymptote: \[y - 15 = -3(x - 5),\]which is equivalent to $\boxed{y = -3x + 30}.$
By Vieta's formulas,
\begin{align*}
(a + 4i) + (b + 5i) &= 10 + 9i, \\
(a + 4i)(b + 5i) &= 4 + 46i.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $a + b + 9i = 10 + 9i,$ so $a + b = 10.$
Expanding the second equation, we get
\[(ab - 20) + (5a + 4b)i = 4 + 46i.\]Hence, $ab = 24$ and $5a + 4b = 46.$
Solving $a + b = 10$ and $5a + 4b = 46,$ we find $a = 6$ and $b = 4.$  (Note that these values satisfy $ab = 24.$)  Therefore, $(a,b) = \boxed{(6,4)}.$
By AM-GM,
\[\frac{a}{2b} + \frac{b}{4c} + \frac{c}{8a} \ge 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{a}{2b} \cdot \frac{b}{4c} \cdot \frac{c}{8a}} = 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{64}} = \frac{3}{4}.\]Equality occurs when $\frac{a}{2b} = \frac{b}{4c} = \frac{c}{8a} = \frac{1}{4}.$  For example, $a = 1$ and $b = c = 2$ will work, so the minimum value is $\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.$
The intersection of the asymptotes is $(1,2),$ so this is the center of the hyperbola
Since the slopes of the asymptotes are $\pm 1,$ the equation of the hyperbola can be written in the form
\[(x - 1)^2 - (y - 2)^2 = d\]for some constant $d.$  Setting $x = 3$ and $y = 3,$ we get $d = 3,$ so the equation is
\[\frac{(x - 1)^2}{3} - \frac{(y - 2)^2}{3} = 1.\]Then $a^2 = 3$ and $b^2 = 3,$ so $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 6,$ which means $c = \sqrt{6}.$  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \boxed{2 \sqrt{6}}.$
Let's consider the expressions in the denominators
Since $a + b + c = 0,$
\[a^2 - bc = (-b - c)^2 - bc = b^2 + bc + c^2 = b^2 + c(b + c) = b^2 - ac.\]Similarly, we can prove that $b^2 - ac = c^2 - ab.$
Let $x = a^2 - bc = b^2 - ac = c^2 - ab.$  Then the sum is
\[\frac{a^2 b^2 + a^2 c^2 + b^2 c^2}{x^2}.\]Note that
\begin{align*}
x^2 &= (a^2 - bc)(b^2 - ac) \\
&= a^2 b^2 - a^3 c - b^3 c + abc^2 \\
&= a^2 b^2 - (a^3 + b^3) c + abc^2 \\
&= a^2 b^2 - (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) c + abc^2 \\
&= a^2 b^2 + (a^2 - ab + b^2) c^2 + abc^2 \\
&= a^2 b^2 + a^2 c^2 + b^2 c^2.
\end{align*}Therefore,
\[\frac{a^2 b^2 + a^2 c^2 + b^2 c^2}{x^2} = 1.\]Thus, the given expression can only be equal to $\boxed{1}.$
Let $z = a + bi,$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers
\[|(a - 1) + bi| = |(a + 3) + bi| = |a + (b - 1)i|.\]Hence, $(a - 1)^2 + b^2 = (a + 3)^2 + b^2 = a^2 + (b - 1)^2.$
From $(a - 1)^2 + b^2 = (a + 3)^2 + b^2,$ $8a = -8,$ so $a = -1.$  Then the equations above become
\[4 + b^2 = 1 + (b - 1)^2.\]Solving, we find $b = -1.$  Therefore, $z = \boxed{-1 - i}.$
We claim that the maximum value is 2
Note that for $x = y,$
\[\frac{(x + y)^2}{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{4x^2}{2x^2} = 2.\]The inequality $\frac{(x + y)^2}{x^2 + y^2} \le 2$ is equivalent to
\[(x + y)^2 \le 2x^2 + 2y^2,\]which in turn simplifies to $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \ge 0.$  We can write this as $(x - y)^2 \ge 0.$  This inequality holds, and since all our steps are reversible, the inequality $\frac{(x + y)^2}{x^2 + y^2} \le 2$ also holds
Hence, the maximum value is $\boxed{2}.$
We can write $\log_2 x^2 = 2 \log_2 x.$
By the change-of-base formula,
\[\log_{1/2} x = \frac{\log_2 x}{\log_2 1/2} = -\log_2 x,\]so $\log_2 x = 5.$  Then $x = 2^5 = \boxed{32}.$
From the given equation,
\[2013x [f(x - 1) + f(x) + f(x + 1)] = [f(x)]^2\]for all $x \neq 0.$
Let $d$ be the degree of $f(x).$  Then the degree of $2013x [f(x - 1) + f(x) + f(x + 1)]$ is $d + 1,$ and the degree of $[f(x)]^2$ is $2d.$  Hence, $2d = d + 1,$ so $d = 1.$
Accordingly, let $f(x) = ax + b.$  Then the equation $2013x [f(x - 1) + f(x) + f(x + 1)] = [f(x)]^2$ becomes
\[2013x (3ax + 3b) = (ax + b)^2.\]Since $f(x) = ax + b,$ we can write this as $[f(x)]^2 = 6039xf(x),$ so
\[f(x) (f(x) - 6039x) = 0.\]Thus, $f(x) = 0$ or $f(x) = 6039x.$  Since $f(x)$ is non-constant, $f(x) = 6039x.$  Thus, $f(1) = \boxed{6039}.$  We can check that $f(x) = 6039x$ satisfies the given equation.
Let $a$ be the first term, and let $r$ be the common ratio
\begin{align*}
\frac{a}{1 - r} &= 15, \\
\frac{a^2}{1 - r^2} &= 45.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $a = 15(1 - r).$  Substituting into the second equation, we get
\[\frac{225 (1 - r)^2}{1 - r^2} = 45.\]The denominator factors as $(1 + r)(1 - r),$ so the equation simplifies to
\[\frac{5 (1 - r)}{1 + r} = 1.\]Then $5 - 5r = 1 + r,$ so $r = \frac{2}{3}.$  Then $a = 15 \left( 1 - \frac{2}{3} \right) = \boxed{5}.$
To make the parameter $k$ disappear, we set $x = 4.$  Then
\[y = 7(4^2) + 4k - 4k = 112.\]Hence, the fixed point is $\boxed{(4,112)}.$
The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola is $\frac{-b}{2a}=\frac{0}{2(1)}=0$
The vertex is then $(0,-1)$
The intersections of the line $y=r$ with $y=x^2-1$ are found by setting the $y$ values equal to each other, so \begin{align*}
r&=x^2-1 \\
\Rightarrow \quad r+1&=x^2 \\
\Rightarrow \quad \pm\sqrt{r+1}&=x.
\end{align*}So the vertices of our triangle are $(0,-1)$, $(-\sqrt{r+1},r)$, and $(\sqrt{r+1},r)$
If we take the horizontal segment along the line $y=r$ to be the base of the triangle, we can find its length as the difference between the $x$-coordinates, which is $\sqrt{r+1}-(-\sqrt{r+1})=2\sqrt{r+1}$
The height of the triangle is the distance from $(0,-1)$ to the line $y=r$, or $r+1$
So the area of the triangle is
\[A = \frac{1}{2}bh=\frac{1}{2}(2\sqrt{r+1})(r+1)=(r+1)\sqrt{r+1}.\]This can be expressed as $(r+1)^{\frac{3}{2}}$.
We have $8\le A\le 64$, so $8\le (r+1)^{\frac{3}{2}} \le 64$
Taking the cube root of all three sides gives $2\le (r+1)^{\frac{1}{2}}\le 4$, and squaring gives $4\le r+1\le 16$
Finally, subtract $1$ to find $3\le r\le 15$
In interval notation, this is $\boxed{[3,15]}$.
Begin by combining logs: $$\log_2\left (\frac{3x+9}{5x-3}\cdot\frac{5x-3}{x-2}\right)=2$$Notice that $5x-3$ cancels
We are left with: $$\log_2\frac{3x+9}{x-2}=2$$Now, eliminate logs and solve: \begin{align*}
\frac{3x+9}{x-2}&=2^2\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 3x+9&=4(x-2)\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 3x+9&=4x-8\\
\Rightarrow\qquad \boxed{17}&=x\\
\end{align*}
The sum of the numbers 1, 2, 3, $\dots,$ 99 is $\frac{99 \cdot 100}{2} = 4950,$ so $x$ satisfies
\[\frac{4950 + x}{100} = 100x.\]Solving, we find $x = \boxed{\frac{50}{101}}.$
Since $a,$ $b,$ $c$ is an arithmetic sequence, $2b = a + c.$  Since $a,$ $c,$ $b$ is a geometric sequence, $c^2 = ab.$  From these equations, $c = 2b - a,$ and $(2b - a)^2 = ab.$  Then
\[4b^2 - 4ab + a^2 = ab,\]so $a^2 - 5ab + 4b^2 = 0.$  This factors as $(a - b)(a - 4b) = 0.$  Since $a < b,$ $a = 4b.$  Furthermore, $b$ must be negative.
Also, $c = 2b - a = 2b - 4b = -2b,$ where $b$ is negative
The smallest possible value of $c$ is then $\boxed{2}.$
In order for the given function to have a real value, $\log_3(\log_4(\log_5x))>0$ (since the logarithm of only any positive number is real)
In order for the last inequality to be true, $\log_4(\log_5x)>1$ (since the logarithm of only any number greater than 1 is greater than 0)
The last inequality is true only if $\log_5x>4^1=4$, so $x>5^4\Rightarrow x>625,$ or in interval notation, $x \in \boxed{(625, \infty)}.$
\[p(x) = \sum_{s \in S} p_s(x).\]Then for any $n,$ $0 \le n \le 9,$
\[p(n) = \sum_{s \in S} p_s(n) = 2^9 = 512,\]because $p_s(n) = 0$ for 512 polynomials $p_s(x),$ and $p_s(n) = 1$ for 512 polynomials $p_s(x).$
Thus, $p(x) = 512$ for 10 different values $n = 0,$ 1, 2, $\dots,$ 9
Also, $p(x)$ has degree at most 9
Therefore, by the Identity Theorem, $p(x) = 512$ for all $x.$  In particular, $p(10) = \boxed{512}.$
Note that $(x - 2)^2 > 0$ for all $x \neq 2.$  Thus, for $x \neq 2,$ $\frac{x - 4}{(x - 2)^2}$ has the same sign as $x - 4.$  Thus, the solution is $x \in \boxed{(-\infty,2) \cup (2,4)}.$
Setting $x = 1,$ we get
\[f(2) + f \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = 1.\]Setting $x = -1,$ we get
\[f \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) - f(2) = 1.\]Subtracting these equations, we get $2f(2) = 0,$ so $f(2) = \boxed{0}.$
Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get
\[16(x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 64.\]Then
\[\frac{(x - 2)^2}{4} + \frac{(y + 2)^2}{64} = 1.\]Thus, $a = 8$ and $b = 2,$ so $c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = \sqrt{60} = 2 \sqrt{15}.$  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \boxed{4 \sqrt{15}}.$
Our strategy is to take $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ and divide into several expression, apply AM-GM to each expression, and come up with a multiple of $2ab \sqrt{2} + 2bc.$
Since we want terms of $ab$ and $bc$ after applying AM-GM, we divide $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ into
\[(a^2 + kb^2) + [(1 - k)b^2 + c^2].\]By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
a^2 + kb^2 &\ge 2 \sqrt{(a^2)(kb^2)} = 2ab \sqrt{k}, \\
(1 - k)b^2 + c^2 &\ge 2 \sqrt{((1 - k)b^2)(c^2)} = 2bc \sqrt{1 - k}.
\end{align*}To get a multiple of $2ab \sqrt{2} + 2bc,$ we want $k$ so that
\[\frac{2 \sqrt{k}}{2 \sqrt{2}} = \frac{2 \sqrt{1 - k}}{2}.\]Then
\[\frac{\sqrt{k}}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{1 - k}.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[\frac{k}{2} = 1 - k.\]Solving for $k,$ we find $k = \frac{2}{3}.$
\begin{align*}
a^2 + \frac{2}{3} b^2 &\ge 2ab \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}, \\
\frac{1}{3} b^2 + c^2 &\ge 2bc \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}},
\end{align*}so
\[1 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \ge 2ab \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} + 2bc \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}.\]Multiplying by $\sqrt{3},$ we get
\[2ab \sqrt{3} + 2bc \le \sqrt{3}.\]Equality occurs when $a = b \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}$ and $b \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = c.$  Using the condition $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1,$ we can solve to get $a = \sqrt{\frac{2}{6}},$ $b = \sqrt{\frac{3}{6}},$ and $c = \sqrt{\frac{1}{6}}.$  Therefore, the maximum value is $\boxed{\sqrt{3}}.$
Let $n = \lfloor x \rfloor$ and $f = \{x\}.$  Then $x = n + f,$ so
\[\lfloor n^2 + 2nf + f^2 \rfloor - (n + f) n = 6.\]Since $n^2$ is an integer, we can pull it out of the floor, to get
\[n^2 + \lfloor 2nf + f^2 \rfloor - n^2 - nf = 6.\]Thus,
\[\lfloor 2nf + f^2 \rfloor - nf = 6.\]Since $\lfloor 2nf + f^2 \rfloor$ and 6 are integers, $nf$ must also be an integer
Hence, we can also pull $2nf$ out of the floor, to get
\[2nf + \lfloor f^2 \rfloor = nf + 6,\]so $nf + \lfloor f^2 \rfloor = 6.$
Since $0 \le f < 1,$ $0 \le f^2 < 1,$ so $\lfloor f^2 \rfloor = 0.$  Hence, $nf = 6,$ so
\[n = \frac{6}{f}.\]Since $f < 1,$ $n > 6.$  The smallest possible value of $n$ is then 7
If $n = 7,$ then $f = \frac{6}{7},$ so $x = 7 + \frac{6}{7} = \frac{55}{7},$ which is a solution
Thus, the smallest solution $x$ is $\boxed{\frac{55}{7}}.$
Note that $x = 0$ is not a solution
Also, if $x < 0,$ then the left-hand side is positive and the right-hand side is negative, so $x$ cannot be a solution
Thus, any real roots must be positive
Assume $x > 0.$
Dividing both sides by $x^{2005},$ we get
\[\frac{(x^{2006} + 1)(x^{2004} + x^{2002} + x^{2000} + \dots + x^2 + 1)}{x^{2005}} = 2006.\]Then
\[\frac{x^{2006} + 1}{x^{1003}} \cdot \frac{x^{2004} + x^{2002} + x^{2000} + \dots + x^2 + 1}{x^{1002}} = 2006,\]or
\[\left( x^{1003} + \frac{1}{x^{1003}} \right) \left( x^{1002} + x^{1000} + x^{998} + \dots + \frac{1}{x^{998}} + \frac{1}{x^{1000}} + \frac{1}{x^{1002}} \right) = 2006.\]By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
x^{1003} + \frac{1}{x^{1003}} &\ge 2, \\
x^{1002} + x^{1000} + x^{998} + \dots + \frac{1}{x^{998}} + \frac{1}{x^{1000}} + \frac{1}{x^{1002}} &\ge \sqrt[1003]{x^{1002} \cdot x^{1000} \cdot x^{998} \dotsm \frac{1}{x^{998}} \cdot \frac{1}{x^{1000}} \cdot \frac{1}{x^{1002}}} = 1003,
\end{align*}so
\[\left( x^{1003} + \frac{1}{x^{1003}} \right) \left( x^{1002} + x^{1000} + x^{998} + \dots + \frac{1}{x^{998}} + \frac{1}{x^{1000}} + \frac{1}{x^{1002}} \right) \ge 2006.\]Since we have the equality case, the only possible value of $x$ is 1, so there is $\boxed{1}$ real root.
Let $f(x) = \sqrt{19} + \frac{91}{x}.$ Then the given equation says \[x = f(f(f(f(f(x)))))
\quad (*)\]Notice that any root of $x = f(x)$ is also a root of $(*),$ since if $x = f(x),$ then replacing $x$ with $f(x)$ four times gives \[x = f(x) = f(f(x)) = f(f(f(x))) = f(f(f(f(x)))) = f(f(f(f(f(x))))).\]In fact, the roots of $x = f(x)$ are the only roots of $(*).$ This is because, upon expanding both equations, they become quadratics in $x,$ so they both have exactly two roots for $x.$
Thus, it suffices to solve $x = f(x),$ or \[x = \sqrt{19} + \frac{91}{x} \implies x^2 - x\sqrt{19} - 91 = 0.\]By the quadratic formula, we have \[x = \frac{\sqrt{19}\pm \sqrt{19 + 4 \cdot 91} }{2} = \frac{\sqrt{19} \pm\sqrt{383}}{2}.\]The root $\frac{\sqrt{19}-\sqrt{383}}{2}$ is negative (while the other root is positive), so the sum of the absolute values of the roots is \[A = \frac{\sqrt{19}+\sqrt{383}}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{19}-\sqrt{383}}{2} = \sqrt{383}.\]The answer is $A^2 = \boxed{383}.$
First, we have that
\[\frac{a}{b} = \frac{\log 9}{\log 16} = \frac{\log 3^2}{\log 4^2} = \frac{2 \log 3}{2 \log 4} = \frac{\log 3}{\log 4}.\]Let $x = 4^{a/b}.$  Then
\[\log x = \log 4^{a/b} = \frac{a}{b} \log 4 = \frac{\log 3}{\log 4} \cdot {\log 4} = \log 3,\]so $x = 3.$
Let $y = 3^{b/a}.$  Then
\[\log y = \log 3^{b/a} = \frac{b}{a} \log 3 = \frac{\log 4}{\log 3} \cdot \log 3 = \log 4,\]so $y = 4.$
Therefore, $x + y = \boxed{7}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
\frac{3 + 5i}{3 - 5i} + \frac{3 - 5i}{3 + 5i} &= \frac{(3 + 5i)(3 + 5i)}{(3 - 5i)(3 + 5i)} + \frac{(3 - 5i)(3 - 5i)}{(3 + 5i)(3 - 5i)} \\
&= \frac{9 + 15i + 15i + 25i^2}{9 - 25i^2} + \frac{9 - 15i - 15i + 25i^2}{9 - 25i^2} \\
&= \frac{9 + 30i - 25 + 9 - 30i - 25}{9 + 25} \\
&= \frac{-32}{34} = \boxed{-\frac{16}{17}}.
\end{align*}
Since $2x - 6 = 2(x - 3),$ by the Remainder Theorem, we can find the remainder by setting $x = 3.$  Thus, the remainder is
\[6 \cdot 3^4 - 14 \cdot 3^3 - 4 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 - 26 = \boxed{52}.\]
By Vieta's Formulas, we have  $a + b + c = 9$, $ab + ac + bc = 11$, and $abc = 1$, so $\sqrt{abc} = 1$
(Note that the roots $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive.)
We have
\[s^2 = a + b + c + 2 \sqrt{ab} + 2 \sqrt{ac} + 2 \sqrt{bc} = 9 + 2(\sqrt{ab} + \!\sqrt{ac} + \!\sqrt{bc}),\]so $s^2 - 9 = 2(\sqrt{ab} + \!\sqrt{ac} + \!\sqrt{bc})$
Squaring, we get
\begin{align*}
s^4 - 18s^2 + 81 &= 4(ab + ac + bc + 2 \sqrt{ab} \sqrt{ac} + 2 \sqrt{ab} \sqrt{bc} + 2 \sqrt{ac} \sqrt{bc}) \\
&= 4[ab + ac + bc + 2 \sqrt{abc} (\sqrt{a} + \!\sqrt{b} + \!\sqrt{c})]
= 4(11 + 2s)
= 44 + 8s,
\end{align*}so $s^4 - 18s^2 - 8s + 37 = 0$
Therefore, $s^4 - 18s^2 - 8s = \boxed{-37}$.
Let $z = a + bi$ and $w = c + di,$ where $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ are complex numbers
Then from $|z| = 1,$ $a^2 + b^2 = 1,$ and from $|w| = 1,$ $c^2 + d^2 = 1.$  Also, from $z \overline{w} + \overline{z} w = 1,$
\[(a + bi)(c - di) + (a - bi)(c + di) = 1,\]so $2ac + 2bd = 1.$
\begin{align*}
(a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2 &= a^2 + 2ac + c^2 + b^2 + 2bd + d^2 \\
&= (a^2 + b^2) + (c^2 + d^2) + (2ac + 2bd) \\
\end{align*}The real part of $z + w$ is $a + c,$ which can be at most $\sqrt{3}.$  Equality occurs when $z = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} i$ and $w = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{1}{2} i,$ so the largest possible value of $a + c$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{3}}.$
Since $\operatorname{sign} (x + y)$ can be $-1,$ 0, or 1, $z$ can be 4037, 2018, or $-1.$  The same holds for $x$ and $y.$  But we can then check that $x + y$ cannot be 0, so $z$ can only be 4037 or $-1.$  And again, the same holds for $x$ and $y.$
If any two of $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are equal to $-1,$ then the third must be equal to 4037
Conversely, if any of $x,$ $y,$ $z$ are equal to 4037, then the other two must be equal to $-1.$  Therefore, the only solutions are $(4037,-1,-1),$ $(-1,4037,-1),$ and $(-1,-1,4037),$ giving us $\boxed{3}$ solutions.
Putting these fractions over a common denominator, we get \[\frac{1}{ab} + \frac{1}{ac} + \frac{1}{ad} + \frac{1}{bc} + \frac{1}{bd} + \frac{1}{cd} = \frac{cd + bd + ac + ad + ac + ab}{abcd}.\]By Vieta's formulas, $ab+ac+ad+bc+bd+cd=9$ and $abcd=4.$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\tfrac 94}.$
We can write the given equation as
\[x^2 + 4x \sqrt{x + 3} + 4(x + 3) = 25.\]Then
\[(x + 2 \sqrt{x + 3})^2 = 25,\]so $x + 2 \sqrt{x + 3} = \pm 5.$  Then
\[-x \pm 5 = 2 \sqrt{x + 3}.\]Squaring both sides, we get $x^2 \pm 10x + 25 = 4x + 12.$
In the $+$ case, we get
\[x^2 + 6x + 13 = 0,\]which has no real solutions.
In the $-$ case, we get
\[x^2 - 14x + 13 = 0,\]which leads to the solutions 1 and 13
We check that only $\boxed{1}$ works.
We know $|(4\sqrt{2}-4i)(\sqrt{3}+3i)| = |4\sqrt{2}-4i||\sqrt{3}+3i|.$ Calculating the magnitudes gives us $\sqrt{32+16} \cdot \sqrt{3+9} = \sqrt{48} \cdot \sqrt{12} = 4\sqrt{3} \cdot 2\sqrt{3} = \boxed{24}$
Note that the axis of symmetry of the parabola is $x = \frac{-(-8)}{2\cdot1}=4.$
Let $2t$ be the side length of the square
\begin{align*}
A &= (4 - t, 0), \\
B &= (4 + t, 0), \\
C &= (4 + t, -2t), \\
D &= (4 - t, -2t).
\end{align*}But $C$ lies on the parabola $y = x^2 - 8x + 12 = (x - 4)^2 - 4,$ so
\[-2t = t^2 - 4.\]Then $t^2 + 2t - 4 = 0,$ so by the quadratic formula,
\[t = -1 \pm \sqrt{5}.\]Since $t$ is half a side length, it must be positive, and so $t = -1 + \sqrt{5}.$  Therefore, the area of the square is
\[(2t)^2 = (-2 + 2 \sqrt{5})^2 = \boxed{24 - 8 \sqrt{5}}.\]
Expanding and completing the square, we get
\begin{align*}
(12 - x)(10 - x)(12 + x)(10 + x) &= (10 + x)(10 - x)(12 + x)(12 - x) \\
&= (100 - x^2)(144 - x^2) \\
&= x^4 - 244x^2 + 14400 \\
&= (x^2 - 122)^2 - 484.
\end{align*}The minimum value of $\boxed{-484}$ occurs at $x = \pm \sqrt{122}.$
\begin{align*}
x^4-4x^3-4x^2+16x-8&=(x^4-4x^3+4x^2)-(8x^2-16x+8)\\
&=x^2(x-2)^2-8(x-1)^2\\
&=(x^2-2x)^2-(2\sqrt{2}x-2\sqrt{2})^2\\
&=(x^2-(2+2\sqrt{2})x+2\sqrt{2})(x^2-(2-2\sqrt{2})x-2\sqrt{2}).
\end{align*}But noting that $(1+\sqrt{2})^2=3+2\sqrt{2}$ and completing the square, \begin{align*}
x^2-(2+2\sqrt{2})x+2\sqrt{2}&= x^2-(2+2\sqrt{2})x+3+2\sqrt{2}-3\\
&=(x-(1+\sqrt{2}))^2-(\sqrt{3})^2\\
&=(x-1-\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})(x-1-\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3}).
\end{align*}Likewise, \begin{align*}
x^2-(2-2\sqrt{2})x-2\sqrt{2}=(x-1+\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})(x-1+\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3}),
\end{align*}so the roots of the quartic are $1\pm\sqrt{2}\pm\sqrt{3}$
Only one of these is negative, namely $1-\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3}$, so the sum of the absolute values of the roots is $$(1+\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})+(1+\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3})+(1-\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})-(1-\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3})=\boxed{2+2\sqrt{2}+2\sqrt{3}}.$$
Let $$S =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{5n-1}{k^n} = \frac{4}{k} +   \frac{9}{k^2} +  \frac{14}{k^3} + \dotsb.$$Multiplying by $k$ gives us
$$kS = 4 + \frac{9}{k} +   \frac{14}{k^2} +  \frac{19}{k^3} + \dotsb.$$Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us
$$\begin{aligned}(k-1)S &= 4 + \frac{5}{k} +   \frac{5}{k^2} +  \frac{5}{k^3} + \dotsb \\
&= 4 + \frac{\frac{5}{k}}{1-\frac{1}{k}} \\
&= 4 + \frac{5}{k-1} \\
&= \frac{4k +1}{k-1}.
\end{aligned}$$Therefore,
$$S = \frac{4k +1}{(k-1)^2} = \frac{13}{4}.$$Rearranging gives,
$$16k + 4 = 13(k^2-2k+1).$$Bringing all the terms on one side gives us
$$13k^2-42k+9 = 0$$Factoring gives
$$(k-3)(13k-3) = 0.$$Hence, $k=3$ or $k= \frac{3}{13}$
Since we are told that $k > 1$ (and more importantly, the series converges), we have that $k = \boxed{3}.$
Solution #1
Since $p(x)$ has real coefficients and has $3-2i$ as a root, it also has the complex conjugate, $3+2i$, as a root
The quadratic that has $3-2i$ and $3+2i$ as roots is
\begin{align*}
\left(x-(3-2i)\right)\left(x-(3+2i)\right) &= (x-3+2i)(x-3-2i) \\
&= (x-3)^2 - (2i)^2 \\
&= x^2-6x+9+4 \\
&= x^2-6x+13.
\end{align*}By the Factor Theorem, we know that $x^2-6x+13$ divides $p(x)$
Since $p(x)$ is cubic, it has one more root $r$
We can now write $p(x)$ in the form
$$p(x) = a(x^2-6x+13)(x-r).$$Moreover, $a=1$, because we are given that $p(x)$ is monic.
Substituting $x=0$, we have $p(0)=-13r$, but we also know that $p(0)=-52$; therefore, $r=4$
Hence we have
\begin{align*}
p(x) &= (x^2-6x+13)(x-4) \\
&= \boxed{x^3-10x^2+37x-52}.
\end{align*}Solution #2 (essentially the same as #1, but written in terms of using Vieta's formulas)
Since $p(x)$ has real coefficients and has $3-2i$ as a root, it also has the complex conjugate, $3+2i$, as a root
The sum and product of these two roots, respectively, are $6$ and $3^2-(2i)^2=13$
Thus, the monic quadratic that has these two roots is $x^2-6x+13$.
By the Factor Theorem, we know that $x^2-6x+13$ divides $p(x)$
Since $p(x)$ is cubic, it has one more root $r$
Because $p(0)$ equals the constant term, and because $p(x)$ is monic, Vieta's formulas tell us that $(3-2i)(3+2i)r = (-1)^3(-52) = 52$
Thus $r=4$, and
\begin{align*}
p(x) &= (x^2-6x+13)(x-4) \\
&= \boxed{x^3-10x^2+37x-52}.
\end{align*}
The expression is defined as long as the denominator $|x - 3| + |x + 1|$ is not equal to 0
Since the absolute value function is always non-negative, the only way that $|x - 3| + |x + 1| = 0$ is if both $|x - 3|$ and $|x + 1|$ are equal to 0
In turn, this occurs if and only if $x = 3$ and $x = -1$
Clearly, $x$ cannot be both 3 and $-1$ at the same time, so the denominator is always non-zero
Therefore, the domain of the function is $\boxed{(-\infty,\infty)}.$
First, assume that $x \ge 0$ and $y \ge 0.$  If $y \ge x,$ then
\[|x + y| + |x - y| = x + y + y - x = 2y \le 4,\]so $y \le 2.$  If $y < x,$ then
\[|x + y| + |x - y| = x + y + x - y = 2x \le 4,\]so $x \le 2.$
Thus, the portion of the graph in the first quadrant is as follows:
unitsize (1 cm);
fill((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle,gray(0.7));
draw((2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2));
draw((-0.5,0)--(2.5,0));
draw((0,-0.5)--(0,2.5));
dot("$2$", (2,0), S);
dot("$2$", (0,2), W);
[/asy]
Now, suppose $(a,b)$ satisfies $|x + y| + |x - y| \le 4,$ so
\[|a + b| + |a - b| \le 4.\]If we plug in $x = a$ and $y = -b,$ then
\[|x + y| + |x - y| = |a - b| + |a + b| \le 4.\]This means if $(a,b)$ is a point in the region, so is $(a,-b).$  Therefore, the region is symmetric around the $x$-axis.
Similarly, if we plug in $x = -a$ and $y = b,$ then
\[|x + y| + |x - y| = |-a + b| + |-a - b| = |a - b| + |a + b| \le 4.\]This means $(-a,b)$ is also a point in the region
Therefore, the region is symmetric around the $y$-axis.
We conclude that the whole region is a square with side length 4.
unitsize (1 cm);
filldraw((-2,-2)--(-2,2)--(2,2)--(2,-2)--cycle,gray(0.7));
draw((-2.5,0)--(2.5,0));
draw((0,-2.5)--(0,2.5));
dot("$2$", (2,0), SE);
dot("$2$", (0,2), NW);
dot("$-2$", (-2,0), SW);
dot("$-2$", (0,-2), SW);
[/asy]
Hence, its area is $\boxed{16}.$
Consider a negative $b$ and a positive $c$
Then $ab$ is positive and $bc$ is negative, and hence this is not true.
If we consider negative numbers for all three variables, $ac>bc$, and hence this is not true.
Consider a negative $b$ and a positive $c$
Then $ab$ is positive and $ac$ is negative, hence this is not true.
Subtracting $b$ from both sides gives us $a<c$ which we know is true.
If $c$ is positive then $c/a$ is negative and $c/a < 1$
If $c$ is negative, then $a<c<0$ which means $c/a < 1$.
Thus, $\boxed{D, E}$ are always true.
Let $y = x^2 + 1.$  Then $x^2 = y - 1,$ and $x^4 = y^2 - 2y + 1,$ so
\[f(y) = (y^2 - 2y + 1) + 4(y - 1) = y^2 + 2y - 3.\]Hence,
\[f(x^2 - 1) = (x^2 - 1)^2 + 2(x^2 - 1) - 3 = \boxed{x^4 - 4}.\]
Setting $x=3$ and $x=-2,$ we get the two equations \[\begin{aligned} 27a+9b+3c+d &= 0, \\ -8a+4b-2c+d &= 0
\end{aligned}\]Subtracting these two equations eliminates $d$ and gives \[35a + 5b + 5c = 0.\]Thus, $b+c=-7a,$ so $\frac{b+c}{a} = \boxed{-7}.$
Since we know that $A,B,C$ are integers, we know that the vertical asymptotes occur at the vertical lines $x = -2$ and $x = 3$
Also, since the degree of the numerator and denominator of $f$ are the same, it follows that the horizontal asymptote of $f$ occurs at the horizontal line $y = 1/A$.
We see from the graph that $1/A < 1.$  Also, we are told that for sufficiently large values of $x,$ $f(x) > 0.4,$ so
\[0.4 \le \frac{1}{A} < 1.\]As $A$ is an integer, it follows that $A = 2$.
Hence, the denominator of the function is given by $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 2(x+2)(x-3) = 2x^2 - 2x - 12$
Then, $A+B+C = 2 - 2 - 12 = \boxed{-12}$.
By symmetry, the two circles are tangent to each other at the origin $(0,0).$ Therefore, their centers are at the points $(\pm r, 0).$ In particular, the circle on the right has the equation \[(x-r)^2 + y^2 = r^2.\]We solve this equation simultaneously with $x^2 + 5y^2 = 6.$ Multiplying the first equation by $5$ and subtracting the second equation gives \[[5(x-r)^2 + 5y^2] - [x^2+5y^2] = 5r^2 - 6,\]or \[4x^2 - 10xr + 5r^2 = 5r^2 - 6.\]Thus, \[4x^2 - 10xr + 6 = 0.\]Since the circle on the right and ellipse intersect in two points with the same $x$-coordinate, this quadratic must have exactly one solution for $x.$ Therefore, the discriminant must be zero: \[(10r)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 = 0.\]The positive solution for $r$ is $r = \boxed{\frac{2\sqrt6}{5}}.$
For $i \ge 6,$ $a_i = a_1 a_2 \dotsm a_{i - 1} - 1.$  So
\begin{align*}
a_{i + 1} &= a_1 a_2 \dotsm a_i - 1 \\
&= (a_1 a_2 \dotsm a_{i - 1}) a_i - 1 \\
&= (a_i + 1) a_i - 1 \\
&= a_i^2 + a_i - 1.
\end{align*}Then $a_i^2 = a_{i + 1} - a_i + 1,$ so
\begin{align*}
a_1 a_2 \dotsm a_{2011} - \sum_{i = 1}^{2011} a_i^2 &= a_{2012} + 1 - (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2 + a_5^2) - \sum_{i = 6}^{2011} (a_{i + 1} - a_i + 1) \\
&= a_{2012} + 1 - (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2 + a_5^2) - (a_{2012} - a_6 + 2006) \\
&= a_6 - (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2 + a_5^2) - 2005 \\
&= 119 - (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2) - 2005 \\
&= \boxed{-1941}.
\end{align*}
We use synthetic division.
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
\multicolumn{1}{r|}{-5} & {1} & 0 & -23 & 11 & -14 & 10 \\
\multicolumn{1}{r|}{} & & -5& 25& -10 & -5 & 95 \\
\cline{2-7}
& 1& -5& 2& 1 & -19& \multicolumn{1}{|r}{105} \\
\end{array}
\]So we have a quotient of $\boxed{x^4-5x^3+2x^2+x-19}$ and a remainder of $105$.
From the equation $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4,$ $a^2 \le 4,$ so $a \le 2,$ or $2 - a \ge 0.$  Then
\[(2 - a) a^2 \ge 0,\]so $a^3 \le 2a^2.$  Similarly, $b^3 \le 2b^2,$ $c^3 \le 2c^2,$ and $d^3 \le 2d^2.$  Adding all these inequalities, we get
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \le 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) = 8.\]Equality occurs when $a = 2$ and $b = c = d = 0,$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{8}.$
We are asked to find the integers whose cubes are between $-50$ and $50$
Since $f(x)=x^3$ is a monotonically increasing function, we can find the least and the greatest integers satisfying the inequality and count the integers between them, inclusive (see graph)
Since $3^3=27<50$ and $4^3=64>50$, $n=3$ is the largest solution
Similarly, $n=-3$ is the smallest solution
Therefore, there are $3-(-3)+1=\boxed{7}$ solutions

Since the system has exactly one solution, the graphs of the two equations must intersect at exactly one point
If $x<a$, the equation $y = |x-a| + |x-b| + |x-c|$ is equivalent to $y =-3x + (a+b+c)$
By similar calculations we obtain
\begin{cases}
-3x + (a+b+c), &\text{if }x<a\\
-x + (-a+b+c), &\text{if }a\le x<b\\
x + (-a-b+c), &\text{if }b\le x<c\\
3x + (-a-b-c), &\text{if }c\le x.
\end{cases}
\]Thus the graph consists of four lines with slopes $-3$, $-1$, 1, and 3, and it has corners at $(a, b+c-2a)$, $(b, c-a)$, and $(c,
2c-a-b)$.
On the other hand, the graph of $2x+y = 2003$ is a line whose slope is $-2$
If the graphs intersect at exactly one point, that point must be $(a, b+c-2a).$ Therefore
$ 2003 = 2a + (b+c-2a) = b+c
Since $b<c$, the minimum value of $c$ is $\boxed{1002}$.
Note that the 8 in the first fraction cancels with the 8 in the second fraction, the 12 in the second fraction cancels with the 12 in the third fraction, and so on
We are then left with $\frac{2008}{4} = \boxed{502}.$
Let the integer roots be $r,$ $r,$ and $s,$ so
\[x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 9a = (x - r)^2 (x - s).\]Expanding and matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
2r + s  &= -a, \\
r^2 + 2rs &= b, \\
r^2 s &= -9a.
\end{align*}From the first and third equations, $r^2 s = 9(2r + s),$ so
\[s r^2 - 18r - 9s = 0.\]As a quadratic in $r,$ the discriminant is
\[\sqrt{18^2 - 4(s)(-9s)} = \sqrt{324 + 36s^2} = 3 \sqrt{s^2 + 9}.\]Since $r$ and $s$ are integers, $s^2 + 9$ must be a perfect square
Let $s^2 + 9 = d^2,$ where $d > 0.$  Then
\[(d + s)(d - s) = 9.\]If $s = 0,$ then $a = 0,$ which is not allowed
Otherwise, $d = \pm 5$ and $s = \pm 4.$  If $s = 4,$ then $r = 6,$ and $a = -16$ and $b = 84.$  If $s = -4,$ then $r = -6,$ and $a = 16$ and $b = 84.$  In either case,
\[|ab| = 16 \cdot 84 = \boxed{1344}.\]
Let $f(n)$ denote the sum of the numbers in the $n$th row
We start by looking at an example.
Suppose we take the 5th row, make a copy of every number, and send each copy to the fifth row.
unitsize (1 cm);
pair A, B;
int i;
for (i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) {
A = (2*i - 1,1);
B = (2*i - 2,0);
draw(interp(A,B,0.2)--interp(A,B,0.7),Arrow(6));
A = (2*i - 1,1);
B = (2*i,0);
draw(interp(A,B,0.2)--interp(A,B,0.7),Arrow(6));
label("$4$", (1,1));
label("$7$", (3,1));

label("$4$", (9,1));
label("$4$", (0,0));
label("$4 + 7$", (2,0));
label("$7 + 8$", (4,0));
label("$8 + 7$", (6,0));
label("$7 + 4$", (8,0));
label("$4$", (10,0));
[/asy]
Currently, the sum of the numbers in the fifth row is exactly double the sum of the numbers in the fourth row, because it contains two copies of every number in the fourth row
To make it look like the fifth row in the actual triangle, all we must do is add 1 to the first and last numbers in the row
Thus, $f(5) = 2f(4) + 2.$
More generally,
\[f(n) = 2f(n - 1) + 2\]for any $n \ge 2.$
Let $g(n) = f(n) + 2.$  Then $f(n) = g(n) - 2,$ so
\[g(n) - 2 = 2(g(n - 1) - 2) + 2.\]This simplifies to $g(n) = 2g(n - 1).$  Since $g(1) = 2,$ it follows that $g(n) = 2^n.$  Then $f(n) = 2^n - 2.$  In particular, $f(100) = \boxed{2^{100} - 2}.$
Because the polynomial has rational coefficients, the radical conjugate of each of the given roots must also be roots of the polynomial
However, $1+\sqrt{7}$ and $1-\sqrt{7}$ are each other's radical conjugates, so we only get $2$ more roots
(You might be tempted to think that $3-2\sqrt2$ and $-3-2\sqrt2$ are also a pair of radical conjugates, but the radical conjugate of $3-2\sqrt2$ is $3+2\sqrt2,$ while the radical conjugate of $-3-2\sqrt2$ is $-3+2\sqrt2.$ Therefore, each one of the numbers $3-2\sqrt2$ and $-3-2\sqrt2$ is actually the negation of the radical conjugate of the other one.) In total, the polynomial must have at least $4+2=6$ roots.
Furthermore, the polynomial
\[(x - 3 + 2 \sqrt{2})(x - 3 - 2 \sqrt{2})(x + 3 + 2 \sqrt{2})(x + 3 - 2 \sqrt{2})(x - 1 - \sqrt{7})(x - 1 + \sqrt{7}) = (x^2 - 6x + 1)(x^2 + 6x + 1)(x^2 - 2x - 6)\]has roots $3 \pm 2 \sqrt{2},$ $-3 \pm 2 \sqrt{2},$ and $1 \pm \sqrt{7},$ and has rational coefficients
Hence, the smallest possible degree is $\boxed{6}.$
Setting $a = 5$ and $b = 2,$ we get
\[4f(5) = 25f(2),\]so $\frac{f(5)}{f(2)} = \frac{25}{4}.$
Setting $a = 1$ and $b = 2,$ we get
\[4f(1) = f(2),\]so $\frac{f(1)}{f(2)} = \frac{1}{4}.$  Hence,
\[\frac{f(5) - f(1)}{f(2)} = \frac{25}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{6}.\]
First, $x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 = (x + 2y)^2.$  By AM-GM,
\[x + 2y \ge 2 \sqrt{2xy},\]so $(x + 2y)^2 \ge 8xy.$  Hence,
\[x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 + 2z^2 \ge 8xy + 2z^2.\]If we apply AM-GM directly to $8xy$ and $2z^2,$ then ignoring constants, we will get the term $\sqrt{xyz^2}.$  But the condition is $xyz = 32.$  So instead, we write $8xy + 2z^2$ as $4xy + 4xy + 2z^2.$  Then by AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
4xy + 4xy + 2z^2 &\ge 3 \sqrt[3]{(4xy)(4xy)(2z^2)} \\
&= 3 \sqrt[3]{32x^2 y^2 z^2} \\
&= 3 \sqrt[3]{32 \cdot 32^2} \\
&= 96.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x = 2y$ and $4xy = 2z^2.$  Along with the condition $xyz = 32,$ we can solve to get $x = 4,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 4,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{96}.$
We want to square the equation in order to eliminate the radicals
To do so, we first move the $\sqrt{x+\frac4x}$ term to the right-hand side, giving \[\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{\frac{4}{x}} = 6 - \sqrt{x+\frac{4}{x}}.\]Now we see that squaring will produce lots of common terms on the left-hand and right-hand sides, which cancel: \[\begin{aligned}  \\ \left(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{\frac{4}{x}}\right)^2 &= \left(6 - \sqrt{x+\frac{4}{x}}\right)^2 \\ x + 4 + \frac 4x &= 36 - 12 \sqrt{x + \frac{4}{x}} + \left(x + \frac{4}{x}\right) \end{aligned}\]which simplifies to $3\sqrt{x+\frac{4}{x}} = 8.$ Squaring both sides, multiplying, and rearranging gives the quadratic \[9x^2 - 64x + 36 = 0.\]By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this quadratic is $\boxed{\frac{64}{9}}.$
To be complete, we must check that both of these roots satisfy the original equation
There are two steps in our above solution which could potentially not be reversible: squaring the equation \[\sqrt x + \sqrt{\frac 4x} = 6 - \sqrt{x+\frac 4x},\]and squaring the equation \[3\sqrt{x+\frac 4x} = 8.\]To check that these steps are reversible, we need to make sure that both sides of the equations in both steps are nonnegative whenever $x$ is a root of $9x^2-64x+36=0.$ This quadratic is equivalent to $x+\frac4x=\frac{64}{9},$ so $6-\sqrt{x+\frac4x}=6-\sqrt{\frac{64}{9}}=\frac{10}{3},$ which is positive, and $3\sqrt{x+\frac{4}{x}} = 3\sqrt{\frac{64}{9}} = 8,$ which is also positive
Therefore, all our steps were reversible, so both roots of the quadratic satisfy the original equation as well.
Subtracting $2$ from both sides, we get \[\frac{x-1}{x-3} - 2 \ge 0,\]or \[\frac{x-1 - 2(x-3)}{x-3} = \frac{-x+5}{x-3} \ge 0.\]Negating both sides, we have \[\frac{x-5}{x-3} \le 0.\]Letting $f(x) = \frac{x-5}{x-3},$ we make a sign table with the two factors $x-5$ and $x-3$: \begin{tabular}{c|cc|c} &$x-5$ &$x-3$ &$f(x)$ \\ \hline$x<3$ &$-$&$-$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$3<x<5$ &$-$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$x>5$ &$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]\end{tabular}We see that $f(x) \le 0$ when $3 < x < 5,$ as well as at the endpoint $x=5.$ Therefore, the solution set is the interval $\boxed{ (3, 5] }.$
We recognize part of the expansion of $(x-1)^4$ on the left-hand side
Adding $1$ to both sides, we have \[x^4-4x^3+6x^2-4x+1=2006,\]which means $(x-1)^4 = 2006.$ Therefore, \[x-1 = \sqrt[4]{2006}, i\sqrt[4]{2006}, -\sqrt[4]{2006}, -i\sqrt[4]{2006}.\]Since we want the nonreal roots, we only consider the roots \[ x = 1 \pm i\sqrt[4]{2006}.\]The product of these roots is \[P = (1 + i\sqrt[4]{2006})(1 - i\sqrt[4]{2006}) = \boxed{1 +\sqrt{2006}}.\]
Let $n = \lfloor x \rfloor,$ and let $\{x\} = (0.x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 \dots)_{10},$ so the $x_i$ are the decimal digits
Then the given condition becomes
\[\lfloor y \rfloor \le 100 \{x\} - \lfloor x \rfloor = (x_1 x_2.x_3 x_4 \dots)_{10} - n.\]Since $\lfloor y \rfloor$ is an integer, this is equivalent to
\[\lfloor y \rfloor \le (x_1 x_2)_{10} - n.\]First, let's look at the interval where $0 \le x < 1,$ so $n = 0.$  For $0 \le x < 0.01,$ we want
\[\lfloor y \rfloor \le 0,\]so $0 \le y < 1.$
For $0.01 \le x < 0.02,$ we want
\[\lfloor y \rfloor \le 1,\]so $0 \le y < 2.$
For $0.02 \le x < 0.03,$ we want
\[\lfloor y \rfloor \le 2,\]so $0 \le y < 3,$ and so on.
Thus, for $0 \le x < 1,$ the region is as follows.

The area of this part of the region is then
\[0.01(1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 100) = 0.01 \cdot \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2}.\]Next, we look at the interval where $1 \le x < 2,$ so $n = 1.$  For $1 \le x < 1.01,$ we want
\[\lfloor y \rfloor \le 0 - 1 = -1,\]so there are no values of $y$ that work.
For $1.01 \le x < 1.02,$ we want
\[\lfloor y \rfloor \le 1 - 1 = 0,\]so $0 \le y < 1.$
For $1.02 \le x < 1.03,$ we want
\[\lfloor y \rfloor \le 2 - 1 = 1,\]so $0 \le y < 2,$ and so on.
Thus, for $1 \le x < 2,$ the region is as follows.

[/asy]
The area of this part of the region is then
\[0.01(1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 99) = 0.01 \cdot \frac{99 \cdot 100}{2}.\]Similarly, the area of the region for $2 \le x < 3$ is
\[0.01(1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 98) = 0.01 \cdot \frac{98 \cdot 99}{2},\]the area of the region for $3 \le x < 4$ is
\[0.01(1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 97) = 0.01 \cdot \frac{97 \cdot 98}{2},\]and so on, until the area of the region for $99 \le x < 100$ is
\[0.01(1) = 0.01 \cdot \frac{1 \cdot 2}{2}.\]Hence, the total area of the region is
\[\frac{0.01}{2} (1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 4 + \dots + 100 \cdot 101) = \frac{1}{200} \sum_{k = 1}^{100} k(k + 1).\]To compute this sum, we can use the formula
\[\sum_{k = 1}^n k^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}.\]Alternatively, we can write
\[k(k + 1) = \frac{(k + 2) - (k - 1)}{3} \cdot k(k + 1) = \frac{k(k + 1)(k + 2) - (k - 1)k(k + 1)}{3},\]which allows sum to telescope, and we get
\[\frac{1}{200} \sum_{k = 1}^{100} k(k + 1) = \frac{1}{200} \cdot \frac{100 \cdot 101 \cdot 102}{3} = \boxed{1717}.\]
Let $y = 10^x.$  Then
\[10^x - 100^x = y - y^2 = \frac{1}{4} - \left( y -  \frac{1}{2} \right)^2.\]Thus, the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}},$ which occurs when $y = \frac{1}{2},$ or $x = \log_{10} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right).$
By QM-AM,
\[\sqrt{\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}} \ge \frac{x + y}{2}.\]Then
\[\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2} \ge \left( \frac{x +  y}{2} \right)^2,\]which we can re-arrange as
\[\frac{x^2 + y^2}{x + y} \ge \frac{x + y}{2}.\]Similarly,
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^2 + y^2}{x + y} &\ge \frac{x + y}{2}, \\
\frac{y^2 + z^2}{y + z} &\ge \frac{y + z}{2}.
\end{align*}Therefore,
\[\frac{x^2 + y^2}{x + y} + \frac{x^2 + z^2}{x + z} + \frac{y^2 + z^2}{y + z} \ge \frac{x + y}{2} + \frac{x + z}{2} + \frac{y + z}{2} = x + y + z = 6.\]Equality occurs when $x = y = z = 2,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{6}.$
From the given inequality, either $\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} > 2$ or $\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} < -2.$
The inequality $\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} > 2$ becomes
\[\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} - 2 > 0,\]or
\[\frac{1}{x - 1} > 0.\]This is satisfied when $x > 1.$
The inequality $\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} < -2$ becomes
\[\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} + 2 < 0,\]or
\[\frac{4x - 3}{x - 1} < 0.\]If $x < \frac{3}{4},$ then $4x - 3 < 0$ and $x - 1 < 0,$ so the inequality is not satisfied.
If $\frac{3}{4} < x < 1,$ then $4x - 3 > 0$ and $x - 1 < 0,$ so the inequality is satisfied.
If $x > 1,$ then $4x - 3 > 0$ and $x - 1 > 0,$ so the inequality is not satisfied.
Thus, the solution is
\[x \in \boxed{\left( \frac{3}{4}, 1 \right) \cup (1, \infty)}.\]
Let $y = x^2 - 13x - 8.$  Then we can write the given equation as
\[\frac{1}{y + 24x} + \frac{1}{y + 15x} + \frac{1}{y} = 0.\]Multiplying everything by $(y + 24x)(y + 15x)y,$ we get
\[(y + 15x)y + y(y + 24x) + (y + 24x)(y + 15x) = 0.\]This simplifies to $360x^2 + 78xy + 3y^2 = 0,$ which factors as $3(20x + y)(6x + y) = 0.$  Hence, $20x + y = 0$ or $6x + y = 0.$
If $20x + y = 0,$ then $20x + x^2 - 13x - 8 = x^2 + 7x - 8 = (x - 1)(x + 8) = 0,$ so $x = 1$ or $x = -8.$
If $6x + y = 0,$ then $6x + x^2 - 13x - 8 = x^2 - 7x - 8 = (x - 8)(x + 1) = 0,$ so $x = 8$ or $x = -1.$  Thus, the solutions are $\boxed{8,1,-1,-8}.$
Setting $x = y = 0,$ we get
\[f(0) = zf(0)\]for all $z,$ so $f(0) = 0.$
Setting $y = 0,$ we get
\[f(x^2) = xf(x)\]for all $x.$
Setting $x = 0,$ we get
\[f(yf(z)) = zf(y).\]In particular, for $y = 1,$ $f(f(z)) = zf(1).$
Since $f(x^2) = xf(x),$
\[f(f(x^2)) = f(xf(x)).\]But $f(f(x^2)) = x^2 f(1)$ and $f(xf(x)) = xf(x),$ so
\[x^2 f(1) = xf(x).\]Then for $x \neq 0,$ $f(x) = f(1) x.$  Since $f(0) = 0,$
\[f(x) = f(1) x\]for all $x.$
Let $c = f(1),$ so $f(x) = cx.$  Substituting into the given equation, we get
\[cx^2 + c^2 yz = cx^2 + cyz.\]For this to hold for all $x,$ $y,$ and $z,$ we must have $c^2 = c,$ so $c = 0$ or $c = 1.$
Thus, the solutions are $f(x) = 0$ and $f(x) = x.$  This means $n = 2$ and $s = 0 + 5,$ so $n \times s = \boxed{10}.$
Note that the lines $4x - 3y = 30$ and $4x - 3y = -10$ are parallel, so the center of the circle lies on the line which is exactly halfway between these lines, which is $4x - 3y = 10.$

Solving the system $2x + y = 0$ and $4x - 3y = 10,$ we find $x = 1$ and $y = -2.$  Therefore, the center of the circle is $\boxed{(1,-2)}.$
Denote the ellipse by $\mathcal{E}.$ Let $F_1=(9,20)$ and $F_2=(49,55)$ be its foci, and let $X$ be the point where it touches the $x$-axis.

By definition, $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of all points $P$ for which the quantity $PF_1 + PF_2$ is equal to a particular (fixed) constant, say $k.$ Furthermore, letting $A$ and $B$ be the endpoints of the major axis, we observe that \[AB = AF_1 + F_1B = F_2B + F_1B = k\]since $AF_1 = F_2B$ by symmetry
That is, $k$ is the length of the major axis
Therefore, it suffices to compute the constant $k,$ given that $\mathcal{E}$ is tangent to the $x$-axis.
Note that for points $P$ strictly inside $\mathcal{E},$ we have $PF_1 + PF_2 < k,$ and for points $P$ strictly outside $\mathcal{E},$ we have $PF_1 + PF_2 > k.$ Since the $x$-axis intersects $\mathcal{E}$ at exactly one point $X$ and $XF_1 + XF_2 = k,$ it follows that $k$ is the smallest possible value of $PF_1 + PF_2$ over all points $P$ on the $x$-axis.
Now reflect $F_1$ over the $x$-axis to point $F_1',$ as shown:

For a point $P$ on the $x$-axis, we have $PF_1 + PF_2 = PF_1' + PF_2.$ Then, by the triangle inequality, $PF_1' + PF_2 \ge F_1'F_2,$ and equality holds when $P$ lies on segment $\overline{F_1'F_2}.$ Therefore, the smallest possible value of $PF_1 + PF_2$ over all points $P$ on the $x$-axis is $F_1'F_2,$ and so it follows that $k = F_1'F_2.$ Then we compute \[\begin{aligned} F_1'F_2 &= \sqrt{(49-9)^2 + (55-(-20))^2} \\ &= \sqrt{40^2+75^2} \\ &= 5\sqrt{8^2+15^2} \\ &= 5 \cdot 17 \\ &=\boxed{85}
\end{aligned}\]
Let $q(x) = x^2 p(x) - 1.$  Then $q(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, and $q(n) = 0$ for $n = 1,$ 2, 3, and 4, so
\[q(x) = (ax + b)(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)\]for some constants $a$ and $b.$
We know that $q(0) = 0^2 \cdot p(0) - 1 = -1.$  But setting $x = 0$ in the equation above, we get
\[q(0) = 24b,\]so $b = -\frac{1}{24}.$
We also know that the coefficient of $x$ in $q(x) = x^2 p(x) - 1$ is 0
The coefficient of $x$ in
\[q(x) = (ax + b)(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)\]is
\begin{align*}
&a(-1)(-2)(-3)(-4) + b(-2)(-3)(-4) \\
&\quad + b(-1)(-3)(-4) + b(-1)(-2)(-4) + b(-1)(-2)(-3) \\
&= 24a - 50b,
\end{align*}so $a = \frac{50b}{24} = -\frac{25}{288}.$  Hence,
\[q(x) = \left( -\frac{25}{288} x - \frac{1}{24} \right) (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = -\frac{(25x + 12)(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)}{288}.\]Then
\[q(5) = -\frac{137}{12},\]so $p(x) = \frac{q(5) + 1}{25} = \boxed{-\frac{5}{12}}.$
We can rewrite the given equation as \[y^4 - 2y^2 + 1 = 4x^4.\]The left-hand side is the perfect square of a binomial: \[(y^2-1)^2 = 4x^4.\]Therefore, either $y^2-1=2x^2$ or $y^2-1=-2x^2.$ That is, either $y^2-2x^2=1$ or $y^2+2x^2=1.$ These are the equations for a hyperbola and an ellipse, respectively, so the answer is $\boxed{\text{H, E}}.$
Solving for $x$ in $3x + 5y + k = 0,$ we get
\[x = -\frac{5y + k}{3}.\]Substituting into $y^2 = 24x,$ we get
\[y^2 = -40y - 8k,\]or $y^2 + 40y + 8k = 0.$  Since we have a tangent, this quadratic will have a double root, meaning that its discriminant will be 0
This give us $40^2 - 4(8k) = 0,$ so $k = \boxed{50}.$
Write $a = x^2-50x-10$ and $b = x^2+25x+5$
Then the equation given becomes
\[\frac{a+2b-1}{2} = ab,\]so $0=2ab-a-2b+1=(a-1)(2b-1)$
Then $a-1=x^2-50x-11=0$ or $2b-1=2x^2+50x+9=0$
The former has a positive root, $x=\boxed{25 + 2\sqrt{159}}$, while the latter does not.
We have $(a+bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi + (bi)^2 = (a^2 - b^2) + 2abi = 3 + 4i$
Equating real and imaginary parts, we get $a^2 - b^2 = 3$ and $2ab = 4$
The second equation implies $ab = 2$
Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $ab=2$, we know one of them is 2 and the other is 1
Since $a^2-b^2 = 3$, we have $a=2$, $b=1$
So $a+bi = \boxed{2 + i}$.
Without loss of generality, suppose that the centroid of the triangle is at the vertex $(-1,-1)$
In an equilateral triangle, the centroid and the circumcenter coincide, so the three vertices of the triangle are among the intersection points of the hyperbola $xy = 1$ and a circle centered at $(-1,-1)$.
Suppose the hyperbola and circle intersect at four distinct points, shown below on the left, at $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$
Either $A$ or $B$ are two of the vertices, or $C$ and $D$ are two of the vertices
If $A$ and $B$ are two of the vertices, then the triangle will have the line $y = x$ as an axis of symmetry, which means that the third vertex must also lie on the line $y = x$
However, neither of the other two points satisfy this condition
The argument is the same if $C$ and $D$ are two of the vertices.

Therefore, the hyperbola must intersect the circle at exactly three points
In turn, the only way this can happen is if the circle passes through the point $(1,1)$
The circumradius of the triangle is then the distance between $(-1,-1)$ and $(1,1)$, which is $2 \sqrt{2}$
It follows that the side length of the triangle is $2 \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 2 \sqrt{6}$, so the area of the triangle is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot (2 \sqrt{6})^2 = 6 \sqrt{3},$ and the square of the area is $(6 \sqrt{3})^2 = \boxed{108}.$
Since $0 < x < 1,$
\[x^2 < x < 2x,\]and $x^2 < x < \sqrt{x}$ and $x < 1 < \frac{1}{x}.$  Therefore, the smallest number is always $x^2,$ and the answer is $\boxed{\text{B}}.$
We use the result that if $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, then the distance between them on the real number line is $|x - y|.$
First, we place $a$:
unitsize(0.5 cm);
int i;
draw((-11,0)--(11,0));
for (i = -10; i <= 10; ++i) {
draw((i,-0.2)--(i,0.2));
label("$a$", (0,-0.2), S);
[/asy]
We then place a label of $b$ on every point that is two units away from $a$:
unitsize(0.5 cm);
int i;
draw((-11,0)--(11,0));
for (i = -10; i <= 10; ++i) {
draw((i,-0.2)--(i,0.2));
label("$a$", (0,-0.2), S);
label("$b$", (-2,-0.2), S);
label("$b$", (2,-0.2), S);
[/asy]
We then place a label of $c$ on every point that is three units away from a point labelled $b$:
unitsize(0.5 cm);
int i;
draw((-11,0)--(11,0));
for (i = -10; i <= 10; ++i) {
draw((i,-0.2)--(i,0.2));
label("$a$", (0,-0.2), S);
label("$b$", (-2,-0.2), S);
label("$b$", (2,-0.2), S);
label("$c$", (-5,-0.2), S);
label("$c$", (-1,-0.2), S);
label("$c$", (1,-0.2), S);
label("$c$", (5,-0.2), S);
[/asy]
Finally, we place a label of $d$ on every point that is four units away from a point labelled $c$:
unitsize(0.5 cm);
int i;
draw((-11,0)--(11,0));
for (i = -10; i <= 10; ++i) {
draw((i,-0.2)--(i,0.2));
label("$a$", (0,-0.2), S);
label("$b$", (-2,-0.2), S);
label("$b$", (2,-0.2), S);
label("$c$", (-5,-0.2), S);
label("$c$", (-1,-0.2), S);
label("$c$", (1,-0.2), S);
label("$c$", (5,-0.2), S);
label("$d$", (-9,-0.2), S);
label("$d$", (-5,-0.8), S);
label("$d$", (-3,-0.2), S);
label("$d$", (-1,-0.8), S);
label("$d$", (1,-0.8), S);
label("$d$", (3,-0.2), S);
label("$d$", (5,-0.8), S);
label("$d$", (9,-0.2), S);
[/asy]
Thus, the possible values of $|a - d|$ are 1, 3, 5, 9, and their total is $\boxed{18}.$
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
(ae)^2 + (bf)^2 + (cg)^2 + (dh)^2 &\ge 4 \sqrt[4]{(ae)^2 (bf)^2 (cg)^2 (dh)^2} \\
&= 4 \sqrt[4]{(abcdefgh)^2} \\
&= 24.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $(ae)^2 = (bf)^2 = (cg)^2 = (dh)^2,$ $abcd = 4,$ and $efgh = 9.$  For example, we can take $a = b = c = d = \sqrt{2}$ and $e = f = g = h = \sqrt{3}.$  Hence, the minimum value is $\boxed{24}.$
We can factor the polynomial as
\begin{align*}
x^4 - 2x^3 - x + 2 &= (x - 2) x^3 - (x - 2) \\
&= (x - 2)(x^3 - 1) \\
&= (x - 2)(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1).
\end{align*}The quadratic factor $x^2 + x + 1$ has no real roots, so the real roots are $\boxed{1,2}.$
Since the coefficients of the polynomial are real numbers, any nonreal roots must come in conjugate pairs
Thus, when we factor $P(z)$ over the integers, each factor is either of the form $z - c,$ where $c$ is an integer, or
\[(z - a - bi)(z - a + bi) = z^2 - 2az + a^2 + b^2,\]where $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $b \neq 0.$  Furthermore, the product of the constant terms must be 50, so for each linear factor, $c$ divides 50, and for each quadratic factor, $a^2 + b^2$ divides 50
We call these linear and quadratic factors basic factors
For each divisor $d$ of 50, so $d \in \{1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50\},$ let $B_d$ be the set of basic factors where the constant term is $\pm d.$
For $d = 1,$ any basic quadratic factor must satisfy
\[a^2 + b^2 = 1.\]The only solution is $(a,b) = (0, \pm 1),$ which leads to the quadratic factor $z^2 + 1.$  We also have the linear factors $z \pm 1.$  Hence, $|B_1| = 3.$
For $d = 2,$ any basic quadratic factor must satisfy
\[a^2 + b^2 = 2.\]The solutions are $(a,b) = (\pm 1, \pm 1),$ which leads to the quadratic factors $z^2 - 2z + 2$ and $z^2 + 2z + 2.$  We also have the linear factors $z \pm 2.$  Hence, $|B_2| = 4.$
For $d = 5,$ the solutions to
\[a^2 + b^2 = 5\]are $(a,b) = (\pm 1, \pm 2)$ and $(\pm 2, \pm 1),$ so $|B_5| = 6.$
For $d = 10,$ the solutions to
\[a^2 + b^2 = 10\]are $(a,b) = (\pm 1, \pm 3)$ and $(\pm 3, \pm 1),$ so $|B_{10}| = 6.$
For $d = 25,$ the solutions to
\[a^2 + b^2 = 25\]are $(a,b) = (\pm 3, \pm 4),$ $(\pm 4, \pm 3),$ and $(0, \pm 5),$ so $|B_{25}| = 7.$
For $d = 50,$ the solutions to
\[a^2 + b^2 = 50\]are $(a,b) = (\pm 1, \pm 7),$ $(\pm 5, \pm 5),$ and $(\pm 7, \pm 1),$ so $|B_{50}| = 8.$
Now, consider the factors of $P(z)$ which belong in $B_d,$ where $d > 1.$  We have the following cases:
$\bullet$ There is one factor in $B_{50}.$
$\bullet$ There is one factor in $B_2,$ and one factor in $B_{25}.$
$\bullet$ There is one factor in $B_5,$ and one factor in $B_{10}.$
$\bullet$ There is one factors in $B_2,$ and two factors in $B_5.$
Case 1: There is one factor in $B_{50}.$
There are 8 ways to choose the factor in $B_{50}.$
Case 2: There is one factor in $B_2,$ and one factor in $B_{25}.$
There are 4 ways to choose the factor in $B_2,$ and 7 ways to choose the factor in $B_{25}.$
Case 3: There is one factor in $B_5,$ and one factor in $B_{10}.$
There are 6 ways to choose the factor in $B_5,$ and 6 ways to choose the factor in $B_{10}.$
Case 4: There is one factors in $B_2,$ and two factors in $B_5.$
There are 4 ways to choose the factor in $B_2,$ and $\binom{6}{2}$ ways to choose the two factors in $B_5.$
Hence, there are
\[8 + 4 \cdot 7 + 6 \cdot 6 + 4 \binom{6}{2} = 132\]ways to choose the factors in $B_d,$ where $d > 1.$
After we have chosen these factors, we can include $z + 1$ or $z^2 + 1$ arbitrarily
Finally, the constant coefficient is either 50 or $-50$ at this point
If the coefficient is 50, then we cannot include $z - 1.$  If the constant coefficient is $-50,$ then we must include $z - 1.$  Thus, whether we include $z - 1$ or not is uniquely determined.
Therefore, the total number of polynomials in $G$ is $132 \cdot 2^2 = \boxed{528}.$
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{12}) \left( \frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{a_{12}} \right) \ge (1 + 1 + \dots + 1)^2 = 12^2 = 144,\]so
\[\frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{a_{12}} \ge 144.\]Equality occurs when $a_i = \frac{1}{12}$ for all $i,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{144}.$
From the given conditions, $|\alpha^2 - 1| = 2 |\alpha - 1|$ and $|\alpha^4 - 1| = 4 |\alpha - 1|.$  From the first equation,
\[|\alpha + 1||\alpha - 1| = 2 |\alpha - 1|.\]Since $\alpha \neq 1,$ $|\alpha - 1| \neq 0.$  Thus, we can safely cancel the factors of $|\alpha - 1|,$ to get
\[|\alpha + 1| = 2.\]From the second equation,
\[|\alpha^2 + 1||\alpha^2 - 1| = 4 |\alpha - 1|.\]Then $2 |\alpha^2 + 1||\alpha - 1| = 4 |\alpha - 1|,$ so
\[|\alpha^2 + 1| = 2.\]Let $\alpha = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers
Then $\alpha^2 = x^2 + 2xyi - y^2,$ so the equations $|\alpha + 1| = 2$ and $|\alpha^2 + 1| = 2$ becomes
\begin{align*}
|x + yi + 1| &= 2, \\
|x^2 + 2xyi - y^2 + 1| &= 2.
\end{align*}Hence,
\begin{align*}
(x + 1)^2 + y^2 &= 4, \\
(x^2 - y^2 + 1)^2 + (2xy)^2 &= 4.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $y^2 = 4 - (x + 1)^2 = 3 - 2x - x^2.$  Substituting into the second equation, we get
\[(x^2 - (3 - 2x - x^2) + 1)^2 + 4x^2 (3 - 2x - x^2) = 4.\]This simplifies to $8x^2 - 8x = 0,$ which factors as $8x(x - 1) = 0.$  Hence, $x = 0$ or $x = 1.$
If $x = 0,$ then $y^2 = 3,$ so $y = \pm \sqrt{3}.$
If $x = 1,$ then $y^2 = 0,$ so $y = 0.$  But this leads to $\alpha = 1,$ which is not allowed.
Therefore, the possible values of $\alpha$ are $\boxed{i \sqrt{3}, -i \sqrt{3}}.$
Alternative: We can rewrite the second equation as $(x^2 + y^2 + 1)^2 - 4y^2 = 4.$  From the first equation, we have $x^2 + y^2 + 1 = 4 - 2x$ and $y^2 = 4 - (x + 1)^2.$  Substituting these, we get \[ (4 - 2x)^2 - 4(4 - (x + 1)^2) = 4
\]This simplifies to $8x^2 - 8x = 0,$ and we can continue as before.
First we factor $x$ from the numerator, \[\frac{x(1-10x+25x^2)}{8-x^3}.\]Now we see the square of a binomial in the numerator, so our expression is equal to  \[\frac{x(1-5x)^2}{8-x^3}.\]The denominator only has the single (real) root $x=2$, and we can make more sense of that by applying the difference of cubes factorization \[\frac{x(1-5x)^2}{(2-x)(x^2+2x+4)}.\]Now we can factor the entire rational function as  \[\left(\frac{x}{2-x}\right)\left(\frac{(1-5x)^2}{x^2+2x+4}\right).\]Note that the denominator $x^2 + 2x + 4 = (x + 1)^2 + 3$ is always positive
The factor $x$ changes sign at $x = 0,$ the factor $2 - x$ changes sign at $x = 2,$ and the factor $1 - 5x$ changes sign at $x = \frac{1}{5}.$  We build a sign chart accordingly.
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}
& x < 0 & 0 < x < \frac{1}{5} & \frac{1}{5} < x < 2 & 2 < x \\ \hline
x & - & + & + & + \\
2 - x & + & + & + & - \\
(1 - 5x)^2 & + & + & + & + \\
\left(\frac{x}{2-x}\right)\left(\frac{(1-5x)^2}{x^2+2x+4}\right) & - & + & + & -
\end{array}
\]Also, the expression
\[\left(\frac{x}{2-x}\right)\left(\frac{(1-5x)^2}{x^2+2x+4}\right)\]is equal to 0 at $x = 0$ and $x = \frac{1}{5},$ so the solution to
\[\left(\frac{x}{2-x}\right)\left(\frac{(1-5x)^2}{x^2+2x+4}\right) \ge 0\]is $x \in \boxed{[0,2)}.$
Let $S = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \dotsb.$  Then
\[xS = x + 2x^2 + 3x^3 + \dotsb.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[(1 - x) S = 1 + x + x^2 + \dotsb = \frac{1}{1 - x},\]so $S = \frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}.$  Thus, we want to solve
\[\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}  = 9.\]then $(1 - x)^2 = \frac{1}{9},$ so $1 - x = \pm \frac{1}{3}.$  Since $x$ must be less than 1, $1 - x = \frac{1}{3},$ so $x = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.$
Add the equations $y = (x + 1)^2$ and $x + 4 = (y - 3)^2$ to get
\[x + y + 4 = (x + 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2.\](Any point that satisfies both equations must satisfy this equation as well.)
Completing the square in $x$ and $y$, we get
\[\left( x + \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( y - \frac{7}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{13}{2}.\]Thus, $r^2 = \boxed{\frac{13}{2}}.$
Setting $x = y,$ we get $f(0) = 0.$
Setting $x = -1$ and $y = 0,$ we get
\[f(1) = -f(-1),\]so $f(-1) = -1.$
Setting $y = 1$ and $y = -1,$ we get
\begin{align*}
f(x^2 - 1) &= (x - 1) (f(x) + 1), \\
f(x^2 - 1) &= (x + 1) (f(x) - 1),
\end{align*}respectively
Hence, $(x - 1) (f(x) + 1) = (x + 1) (f(x) - 1),$ which simplifies to $f(x) = x.$  We can check that this function works
Therefore, $n = 1$ and $s = 2,$ so $n \times s = \boxed{2}.$
We will use the identity
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz).\]Setting $x = a^2 - b^2,$ $y = b^2 - c^2,$ $z = c^2 - a^2,$ we get
\[(a^2 - b^2)^3 + (b^2 - c^2)^3 + (c^2 - a^2)^3 - 3(a^2 - b^2)(b^2 - c^2)(c^2 - a^2) = 0.\]Setting $x = a - b,$ $y = b - c,$ $z = c - a,$ we get
\[(a - b)^3 + (b - c)^3 + (c - a)^3 - 3(a - b)(b - c)(c - a) = 0.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
\frac{(a^2 - b^2)^3 + (b^2 - c^2)^3 + (c^2 - a^2)^3}{(a - b)^3 + (b - c)^3 + (c - a)^3} &= \frac{3(a^2 - b^2)(b^2 - c^2)(c^2 - a^2)}{3(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)} \\
&= \frac{(a - b)(a + b)(b - c)(b + c)(c - a)(c + a)}{(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)} \\
&= \boxed{(a + b)(a + c)(b + c)}.
\end{align*}
Both $|x + y|$ and $|x| + |y|$ are nonnegative, so $\frac{|x + y|}{|x| + |y|}$ must be nonnegative
When $x = 1$ and $y = -1,$
\[\frac{|x + y|}{|x| + |y|} = \frac{0}{2} = 0,\]so this is clearly the minimum.
On the other hand, by the Triangle Inequality, $|x| + |y| \ge |x + y|,$ so
\[\frac{|x + y|}{|x| + |y|} \le 1.\]Equality occurs when $x = y,$ so the maximum is 1.
Therefore, $M - m = 1 - 0 = \boxed{1}.$
First of all, we know that $|ab|=|a|\cdot |b|$, so \[\left|\left(1 + \sqrt{3}i\right)^4\right|=\left|1 + \sqrt{3} i\right|^4\]We also find that \[\left|1 +\sqrt{3}i\right|=\sqrt{\left(1\right)^2+\left(\sqrt{3}\right)^2}=\sqrt{4}=2\]Therefore, our answer is $2^4=\boxed{16}$.
We have $x+y+z=0,$ and squaring this equation gives \[(x^2+y^2+z^2) + 2(xy+yz+zx) = 0.\]Thus, $x^2+y^2+z^2=-2(xy+yz+zx).$ Since $x, y, z$ are distinct, it is not possible that $x^2+y^2+z^2=0,$ so we have \[\frac{xy+yz+zx}{x^2+y^2+z^2} = \boxed{-\frac12}.\]
Solving the system $y=2x+5$ and $y=-2x+1,$ we get $(x, y) = (-1, 3).$ Therefore, the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at $(-1, 3),$ which must be the center of the hyperbola
Therefore, $(h, k) = (-1, 3),$ so the equation of the hyperbola is \[\frac{(y-3)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x+1)^2}{b^2} = 1\]for some $a$ and $b.$ The equations of the asymptotes are therefore \[\frac{y-3}{a} = \pm \frac{x+1}{b},\]or \[y = 3 \pm \frac{a}{b} (x+1).\]Therefore, the slopes of the asymptotes are $\pm \frac{a}{b}.$ Because $a$ and $b$ are positive, we must have $\frac{a}{b} = 2,$ so $a = 2b.$ Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is \[\frac{(y-3)^2}{4b^2} - \frac{(x+1)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]To find $b,$ we use the fact that the hyperbola passes through $(0, 7).$ Setting $x=0$ and $y=7$ gives the equation \[\frac{(7-3)^2}{4b^2} - \frac{(0+1)^2}{b^2} = 1,\]or $\frac{3}{b^2} = 1.$ Thus, $b = \sqrt{3},$ and so $a = 2b = 2\sqrt{3}.$ Hence the equation of the hyperbola is \[\frac{(y-3)^2}{12} - \frac{(x+1)^2}{3} = 1,\]and $a+h = \boxed{2\sqrt{3}-1}.$

Note that $p(x)$ takes on the same values as $x^2 + 1$ for $x = 1,$ 2, 3, and 4
So, let
\[q(x) = p(x) - x^2 - 1.\]Then $q(x)$ is also a monic quartic polynomial
Also, $q(1) = q(2) = q(3) = q(4) = 0,$ so
\[q(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4).\]Hence, $p(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) + x^2 + 1.$  We can set $x = 5,$ to get $p(5) = \boxed{50}.$
By AM-HM,
\[\frac{x + y}{2} \ge \frac{2}{\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y}}.\]Hence,
\[\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} \ge \frac{4}{x + y} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}.\]Equality occurs when $x = y = 5,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}.$
Simplifying each term in $P,$ \[P=\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) \dotsm \left( \frac{n-1}{n} \right)
\]The denominator of each fraction cancels with the numerator of the next fraction, so $P=\frac{1}{n}.$ When $n=2007,$ $P=\boxed{\frac{1}{2007}}.$
We claim that the product of the non-real zeros is the smallest.
(A) The value of $P(-1)$ is greater than 4.
(B) Since the leading coefficient in $P(x)$ is 1, the product of the zeros of $P$ is $d = P(0),$ which is greater than 4.
(D) The sum of the coefficient of $P(x)$ is $P(1),$ which is greater than 2.
(E) The quartic $P(x)$ has a real root between 1 and 2, and it also has a root between 3 and 4
If there were any more real roots, then the quartic equation $P(x) = 5$ would have more than four roots, which is impossible, so these two real roots are the only real roots
The sum of these real roots is greater than 4.
(C) The product of all the zeros is $d = P(0),$ which is less than 6
The product of the real zeros is greater than 3, so the product the non-real zeros must be less than $\frac{6}{3} = 2.$
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\text{C}}.$
Let $a = f(0)$ and $b = f(f(0))$
Setting $y = x$ in the given equation, we get
\[[f(x)]^2 - x^2 = b \quad (1)\]for all $x$
In particular, for $x = 0$, $a^2 = b$.
Setting $y = 0$ in the given equation, we get
\[f(f(x)) = (a - 1) f(x) + a \quad (2)\]for all $x$.
Substituting $f(x)$ for $x$ in equation (1), we get
\[[f(f(x))]^2 - [f(x)]^2 = b.\]But from equation (2), $[f(f(x))]^2 = [(a - 1) f(x) + a]^2 = (a^2 - 2a + 1) [f(x)]^2 + 2a(a - 1) f(x) + a^2$, so
\[(a^2 - 2a) [f(x)]^2 + 2a(a - 1) f(x) = af(x) [(a - 2) f(x) + 2(a - 1)] = 0\]for all $x$.
If $a \neq 0$, then
\[f(x) [(a - 2) f(x) + 2(a - 1)] = 0\]for all $x$, so $f(x)$ attains at most two different values
But by equation (1), this cannot be the case.
Hence, $a = 0$, then $b = 0$, so from equation (1),
\[[f(x)]^2 = x^2,\]which means $f(x) = x$ or $f(x) = -x$ for all $x$.
Let $x$ be a value such that $f(x) = x$
Then $f(f(x)) = f(x) = x$, so by equation (2), $x = -x$, or $x = 0$
Hence, the only value of $x$ such that $f(x) = x$ is $x = 0$
Therefore, $f(x) = -x$ for all $x$
It is easy to check that this solution works.
Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $f(1)$ is $\boxed{-1}.$
For a rational function, if the degree of the polynomial in the numerator is the same as the degree of the polynomial in the denominator, there is a horizontal asymptote at the $y$-value that equals the ratio of the leading coefficient of the numerator to the leading coefficient of the denominator
For this function the $y$-value must equal $\frac{12}{3}$, or $\boxed{4}$.
We have $(a-bi)^2 = a^2 - 2abi + (bi)^2 = (a^2 - b^2) - 2abi = 8-6i$
Equating real and imaginary parts, we get $a^2 - b^2 = 8$ and $-2ab = -6$, or $ab = 3$
Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $ab=3$, we know one of them is 3 and the other is 1
Since $a^2-b^2 = 8$, trial and error gives $a=3$, $b=1$
So $a-bi = \boxed{3 - i}$.
Dividing the equation by $x^2,$ we get
\[2x^2 + x - 6 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x^2} = 0.\]Let $y = x + \frac{1}{x}.$  Then
\[y^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2},\]so $x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = y^2 - 2.$  Thus, we can re-write the equation above as
\[2(y^2 - 2) + y - 6 = 0.\]This simplifies to $2y^2 + y - 10 = 0.$  The roots are $y = 2$ and $y = -\frac{5}{2}.$
The roots of
\[x + \frac{1}{x} = 2\]are 1 and 1
The roots of
\[x + \frac{1}{x} = -\frac{5}{2}\]are $-2$ and $-\frac{1}{2}.$
Thus, the roots of $2x^4 + x^3 - 6x^2 + x + 2 = 0$ are $\boxed{1, 1, -2, -\frac{1}{2}}.$
\[p(x) = \frac{(x + a)^3}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x + b)^3}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x + c)^3}{(c - a)(c - b)}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
p(-a) &= \frac{(-a + a)^3}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(-a + b)^3}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(-a + c)^3}{(c - a)(c - b)} \\
&= \frac{(b - a)^3}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(c - a)^3}{(c - a)(c - b)} \\
&= \frac{(b - a)^2}{b - c} + \frac{(c - a)^2}{c - b} \\
&= \frac{(b - a)^2 - (c - a)^2}{b - c} \\
&= \frac{[(b - a) + (c - a)][(b - a) - (c - a)]}{b - c} \\
&= \frac{(b + c - 2a)(b - c)}{b - c} \\
&= b + c - 2a \\
&= (a + b + c) + 3(-a)
\end{align*}Similarly,
\begin{align*}
p(-b) &= a + c - 2b = (a + b + c) + 3(-b), \\
p(-c) &= a + b - 2c = (a + b + c) + 3(-c).
\end{align*}Since $p(x) = a + b + c + 3x$ for three distinct values of $x,$ by the Identity Theorem, $p(x) = \boxed{a + b + c + 3x}$ for all $x.$
Setting $x = 1$ and $y = -1 - f(1),$ we get
\[f(f(-1 - f(1)) + 1) = -1 - f(1) + f(1) = -1.\]Let $a = f(-1 - f(1)) + 1,$ so $f(a) = -1.$
Setting $y = a,$ we get
\[f(0) = ax + f(x).\]Let $b = f(0),$ so $f(x) = -ax + b.$  Substituting into the given functional equation, we get
\[-a(x(-ay + b) + x) + b = xy - ax + b.\]This expands as
\[a^2 xy - (ab + a) x + b = xy - ax + b.\]For this to hold for all $x$ and $y,$ we must have $a^2 = 1,$ and $ab + a = a.$  From $a^2 = 1,$ $a = 1$ or $a = -1.$  For either value, $b = 0.$
Hence, the solutions are $f(x) = x$ and $f(x) = -x.$  Therefore, $n = 2$ and $s = 2 + (-2) = 0,$ so $n \times s = \boxed{0}.$
By the Remainder Theorem, $p(3) = 11,$ so
\[A \cdot 3^5 + B \cdot 3^3 + C \cdot 3 + 4 = 11.\]Then $A \cdot 3^5 + B \cdot 3^3 + C \cdot 3 = 7.$
Again by the Remainder Theorem, when $p(x)$ is divided by $x + 3,$ the remainder is
\begin{align*}
p(-3) &= A \cdot (-3)^5 + B \cdot (-3)^3 + C \cdot (-3) + 4 \\
&= -A \cdot 3^5 - B \cdot 3^3 - C \cdot 3 + 4 \\
&= -7 + 4 \\
&= \boxed{-3}.
\end{align*}
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,1).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 1.$
Also, $2a = 1,$ so $a = \frac{1}{2}.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2},$ so $c = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4}.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = \frac{5}{16} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{16},$ so $b = \frac{1}{4}.$
Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{-\frac{5}{4}}.$
\begin{align*}
S &= 2002 + \frac{1}{2} \left( 2001 + \frac{1}{2} \left( 2000 + \dots + \frac{1}{2} \left( 3 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \right) \right) \dotsb \right) \\
&= 2002 + \frac{2001}{2} + \frac{2000}{2^2} + \dots + \frac{3}{2^{1999}} + \frac{2}{2^{2000}}.
\end{align*}Then
\[2S = 2 \cdot 2002 + 2001 + \frac{2000}{2} + \dots + \frac{3}{2^{1998}} + \frac{2}{2^{1999}}.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\begin{align*}
S &= 4004 - 1 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2^2} - \dots - \frac{1}{2^{1999}} - \frac{2}{2^{2000}} \\
&= 4004 - 1 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2^2} - \dots - \frac{1}{2^{1999}} - \frac{1}{2^{1999}} \\
&= 4004 - \frac{1}{2^{1999}} (2^{1999} + 2^{1998} + \dots + 2 + 1 + 1) \\
&= 4004 - \frac{1}{2^{1999}} \cdot 2^{2000} \\
&= 4004 - 2 = \boxed{4002}.
\end{align*}
We have \[1 = \log(xy^{3}) = \log x + 3\log y \quad\text{and}\quad 1 = \log(x^{2}y) = 2\log x + \log y.\]Solving yields $\log x = \frac{2}{5}$ and $\log y = \frac{1}{5}$
Thus \[\log(xy) = \log x + \log y = \boxed{\frac{3}{5}}.\]
We notice that $f(x)$ has only even powers of $x,$ so if we let $y = x^2,$ we can write
$$f(x)=15x^4-13x^2+2=15y^2-13y+2 = (3y-2)(5y-1) .$$Substituting back $x^2$ for $y$ gives us $$f(x)  = (3x^2-2)(5x^2-1).$$Then the roots of $f(x)$ are the roots of $3x^2-2$ and $5x^2-1$, which are $\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}, -\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}},$ and $ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$
Therefore, the greatest root is $\sqrt{\frac 23} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}}.$
First, we solve the equation $f(x) = x.$  This becomes
\[\frac{x + 6}{x} = x,\]so $x + 6 = x^2,$ or $x^2 - x - 6 = (x - 3)(x + 2) = 0.$  Thus, the solutions are $x = 3$ and $x = -2.$
Since $f(x) = x$ for $x = 3$ and $x = -2,$ $f_n(x) = x$ for $x = 3$ and $x = -2,$ for any positive integer $n.$  Furthermore, it is clear that the function $f_n(x)$ will always be of the form
\[f_n(x) = \frac{ax + b}{cx + d},\]for some constants $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  The equation $f_n(x) = x$ then becomes
\[\frac{ax + b}{cx + d} = x,\]or $ax + b = x(cx + d).$  This equation is quadratic, and we know it has roots 3 and $-2,$ so there cannot be any more solutions to the equation $f_n(x) = x.$
Therefore, $S = \{3,-2\},$ which contains $\boxed{2}$ elements.
Let $P = \left( \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{z} + \frac{z}{x} \right) \left( \frac{y}{x} + \frac{z}{y} + \frac{x}{z} \right).$  Then
\begin{align*}
2P &= \left( \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{z} + \frac{z}{x} + \frac{y}{x} + \frac{z}{y} + \frac{x}{z} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{z} + \frac{z}{x} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{y}{x} + \frac{z}{y} + \frac{x}{z} \right)^2 \\
&= 64 - \left( \frac{x^2}{y^2} + \frac{y^2}{z^2} + \frac{z^2}{x^2} + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{z} + 2 \cdot \frac{y}{x} + 2 \cdot \frac{z}{y} \right) - \left( \frac{y^2}{x^2} + \frac{z^2}{y^2} + \frac{x^2}{z^2} + 2 \cdot \frac{z}{x} + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{y} + 2 \cdot \frac{y}{z} \right) \\
&= 48 - \left( \frac{x^2}{y^2} + \frac{y^2}{z^2} + \frac{z^2}{x^2} + \frac{y^2}{x^2} + \frac{z^2}{y^2} + \frac{x^2}{z^2} \right) \\
&= 51 - \left( \frac{x^2}{y^2} + \frac{y^2}{z^2} + \frac{z^2}{x^2} + \frac{y^2}{x^2} + \frac{z^2}{y^2} + \frac{x^2}{z^2} + 3 \right) \\
&= 51 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \left( \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{y^2} + \frac{1}{z^2} \right).
\end{align*}Furthermore,
\[(x + y + z) \left( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} \right) = 3 + \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{z} + \frac{z}{x} + \frac{y}{x} + \frac{z}{y} + \frac{x}{z} = 11\]and
\[(xy + xz + yz) \left( \frac{1}{xy} + \frac{1}{xz} + \frac{1}{yz} \right) = 3 + \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{z} + \frac{z}{x} + \frac{y}{x} + \frac{z}{y} + \frac{x}{z} = 11.\]Therefore, by Cauchy-Schwarz,
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz) \left( \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{y^2} + \frac{1}{z^2} + \frac{2}{xy} + \frac{2}{xz} + \frac{2}{yz} \right) \\
&\ge \left( \sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \left( \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{y^2} + \frac{1}{z^2} \right)} + \sqrt{(2xy + 2xz + 2yz) \left( \frac{2}{xy} + \frac{2}{xz} + \frac{2}{yz} \right)} \right)^2.
\end{align*}This becomes
\[(x + y + z)^2 \left( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} \right)^2 \ge \left( \sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \left( \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{y^2} + \frac{1}{z^2} \right)} + 2 \sqrt{11} \right)^2.\]Then
\[11 \ge \sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \left( \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{y^2} + \frac{1}{z^2} \right)} + 2 \sqrt{11},\]so
\[(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \left( \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{y^2} + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) \le (11 - 2 \sqrt{11})^2 = 165 - 44 \sqrt{11}.\]Then
\[2P \ge 51 - (165 - 44 \sqrt{11}) = 44 \sqrt{11} - 114,\]so $P \ge 22 \sqrt{11} - 57.$
Now we must see if equality is possible
Let $a = x + y + z,$ $b = xy + xz + yz,$ and $c = xyz.$  Then
\[(x + y + z) \left( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} \right) = (x + y + z) \cdot \frac{xy + xz + yz}{xyz} = \frac{ab}{c} = 11,\]so $ab = 11c,$ or $c = \frac{ab}{11}.$  Also,
\begin{align*}
\left( \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{z} + \frac{z}{x} \right) \left( \frac{y}{x} + \frac{z}{y} + \frac{x}{z} \right) &= 3 + \frac{x^2}{yz} + \frac{y^2}{xz} + \frac{z^2}{xy} + \frac{yz}{x^2} + \frac{xz}{y^2} + \frac{xy}{z^2} \\
&= 3 + \frac{x^3 + y^3 + z^3}{xyz} + \frac{x^3 y^3 + x^3 z^3 + y^3 z^3}{x^2 y^2 z^2} \\
&= 3 + \frac{x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz}{xyz} + 3 + \frac{x^3 y^3 + x^3 z^3 + y^3 z^3 - 3x^2 y^2 z^2}{x^2 y^2 z^2} + 3 \\
&= 9 + \frac{(x + y + z)((x + y + z)^2 - 3(xy + xz + yz))}{xyz} \\
&\quad + \frac{(xy + xz + yz)((xy + xz + yz)^2 - 3(x^2 yz + 3xy^2 z + 3xyz^2))}{x^2 y^2 z^2} \\
&= 9 + \frac{(x + y + z)((x + y + z)^2 - 3(xy + xz + yz))}{xyz} \\
&\quad + \frac{(xy + xz + yz)((xy + xz + yz)^2 - 3xyz (x + y + z))}{x^2 y^2 z^2} \\
Since $3x - 6 = 3(x - 2),$ by the Remainder Theorem, we can find the remainder by setting $x = 2.$  Thus, the remainder is
\[6 \cdot 2^3 - 15 \cdot 2^2 + 21 \cdot 2 - 23 = \boxed{7}.\]
The first equation is equivalent to the following: if $a + b = 4$, then $f(a) = f(b)$
Similarly, the second equation is equivalent to the following: if $c + d = 14$, then $f(c) = f(d)$.
Then note that for any $t$, we have \[f(t) = f(4-t) = f(t+10),\]because $t + (4-t) = 4$ and $(4-t) + (t+10) = 14$
This means that if $t$ is a root of $f$, then so is $t+10$, and conversely, if $t+10$ is a root of $f$, then so is $t$
Since $t = 0$ is a root, we see that if $n$ is a multiple of $10$, then $f(n) = 0$
We also have $f(4) = f(0)=0$, so if $n \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$, then $f(n) = 0$.
To see that these are all the necessary roots, observe that \[f(x) = \left\{ \begin{aligned} 0 & \quad \text{if } x \text{ is an integer and either } x \equiv 0 \! \! \! \! \pmod{10} \text{ or } x \equiv 4 \!\ \! \! \! \pmod{10} \\ 1 & \quad \text{otherwise} \end{aligned} \right.\]satisfies all the given conditions, and only has these roots
This is because if $a+b=4$ and $a \equiv 0 \pmod{10}$, then $b \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$, and vice versa
Similarly, if $c + d = 14$ and $c \equiv 0 \pmod{10}$, then $d \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$, and vice versa.
There are $201$ multiples of $10$ in the given interval, and $200$ integers that are $4$ modulo $10$ in the given interval, making $201 + 200 = \boxed{401}$ roots of $f.$
The long division is shown below.

\]Thus, the remainder is $\boxed{-3x - 19}.$
The first few terms are
\begin{align*}
x_2 &= \frac{(n - 1) \cdot 1 - (n - k) \cdot 0}{1} = n - 1, \\
x_3 &= \frac{(n - 1)(n - 1) - (n - 1) \cdot 1}{2} = \frac{(n - 1)(n - 2)}{2}, \\
x_4 &= \frac{(n - 1) \cdot \frac{(n - 1)(n - 2)}{2} - (n - 2)(n - 1)}{3} = \frac{(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)}{6}.
\end{align*}It looks like
\[x_k = \frac{(n - 1)(n - 2) \dotsm (n - k + 1)}{(k - 1)!}\]for $k \ge 2.$  We prove this by induction.
We see that the result holds for $k = 2$ and $k = 3,$ so assume that the result holds for $k = i$ and $k = i + 1$ for some $i \ge 2,$ so
\begin{align*}
x_i &= \frac{(n - 1)(n - 2) \dotsm (n - i + 1)}{(i - 1)!}, \\
x_{i + 1} &= \frac{(n - 1)(n - 2) \dotsm (n - i + 1)(n - i)}{i!}.
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
x_{i + 2} &= \frac{(n - 1) x_{i + 1} - (n - i) x_i}{i + 1} \\
&= \frac{(n - 1) \cdot \frac{(n - 1)(n - 2) \dotsm (n - i + 1)(n - i)}{i!} - (n - i) \cdot \frac{(n - 1)(n - 2) \dotsm (n - i + 1)}{(i - 1)!}}{i + 1} \\
&= \frac{(n - 1)(n - 2) \dotsm (n - i + 1)(n - i)}{(i - 1)!} \cdot \frac{(n - 1)/i - 1}{i + 1} \\
&= \frac{(n - 1)(n - 2) \dotsm (n - i + 1)(n - i)}{(i - 1)!} \cdot \frac{n - 1 - i}{i(i + 1)} \\
&= \frac{(n - 1)(n - 2) \dotsm (n - i + 1)(n - i)(n - i - 1)}{(i + 1)!}.
\end{align*}This completes the induction step.
It follows that
\[x_k = \frac{(n - 1)(n - 2) \dotsm (n - k + 1)}{(k - 1)!} = \frac{(n - 1)!}{(k - 1)! (n - k)!}  =\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}\]for $k \le n,$ and $x_k = 0$ for $k \ge n + 1.$  Therefore,
\[x_0 + x_1 + x_2 + \dotsb = \binom{n - 1}{0} + \binom{n - 1}{1} + \binom{n - 2}{2} + \dots + \binom{n - 1}{n - 1} = \boxed{2^{n - 1}}.\]
The graph of $y = f(x) - 1$ is produced by taking the graph of $y = f(x)$ and shifting down by one unit
The correct graph is $\boxed{\text{C}}.$
Let $X = \ell_B \cap \ell_C,$ $Y = \ell_A \cap \ell_C,$ and $Z = \ell_A \cap \ell_B.$  Here is a diagram of the initial position:

Note that triangle $XZY$ is a $45^\circ$-$45^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle
Since all three lines rotate at the same rate, the angles between these lines always stay the same, so triangle $XZY$ will always be a $45^\circ$-$45^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle.
Let $\alpha = \angle CAZ.$  Depending on the position of the lines, $\angle AZB$ is either $45^\circ$ or $135^\circ.$  Either way, by the Law of Sines on triangle $ABZ,$
\[\frac{BZ}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{11}{\sin 45^\circ},\]so $BZ = 11 \sqrt{2} \sin \alpha.$

Depending on the positions of the lines, $\angle BCX$ is either $90^\circ - \alpha,$ $\alpha - 90^\circ,$ or $\alpha + 90^\circ.$  In any case, by the Law of Sines on triangle $BCX,$
\[\frac{BX}{|\sin (90^\circ - \alpha)|} = \frac{7}{\sin 45^\circ},\]so $BX = 7 \sqrt{2} |\cos \alpha|.$
Again, depending on the positions of the lines, $XZ$ is the sum or the difference of $BX$ and $BZ,$ which means it is of the form
\[\pm 11 \sqrt{2} \sin \alpha \pm 7 \sqrt{2} \cos \alpha.\]Then
\[XY = YZ = \pm 11 \sin \alpha \pm 7 \cos \alpha.\]By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, for any combination of plus signs and minus signs,
\[(\pm 11 \sin \alpha \pm 7 \cos \alpha)^2 \le (11^2 + 7^2)(\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha) = 170,\]so $[XYZ] = \frac{XY^2}{2} \le 85.$
We can confirm that equality occurs when $\alpha$ is the obtuse angle such that $\cos \alpha = -\frac{7}{\sqrt{170}}$ and $\sin \alpha = \frac{11}{\sqrt{170}}.$
unitsize(0.4 cm);

Therefore, the maximum area of triangle $XYZ$ is $\boxed{85}.$
By partial fractions,
\[\frac{1}{n(n + 2)} = \frac{1/2}{n} - \frac{1/2}{n + 2}.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n(n + 2)} &= \left( \frac{1/2}{1} - \frac{1/2}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{1/2}{2} - \frac{1/2}{4} \right) + \left( \frac{1/2}{3} - \frac{1/2}{5} \right) + \left( \frac{1/2}{4} - \frac{1/2}{6} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \frac{1/2}{1} + \frac{1/2}{2} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.
\end{align*}
Setting $x = y = \frac{z}{2}$ in (ii), we get
\[f \left( \frac{1}{z} \right) = 2f \left( \frac{2}{z} \right) \quad (1)\]for all $z \neq 0.$
Setting $x = y = \frac{1}{z}$ in (iii), we get
\[\frac{2}{z} f \left( \frac{2}{z} \right) = \frac{1}{z^2} f \left( \frac{1}{z} \right)^2\]for all $z \neq 0.$  Hence,
\[2f \left( \frac{2}{z} \right) = \frac{1}{z} f \left( \frac{1}{z} \right)^2
\quad (2)\]From (1) and (2),
\[f \left( \frac{1}{z} \right) = \frac{1}{z} f \left( \frac{1}{z} \right)^2,\]so
\[f(x) = xf(x)^2 \quad (3)\]for all $x \neq 0.$
Suppose $f(a) = 0$ for some $a \neq 0.$  Since $f(1) = 1,$ $a \neq 1.$  Setting $x = a$ and $y = 1 - a$ in (iii), we get
\[f(1) = a(1 - a) f(a) f(1 - a) = 0,\]contradiction
Therefore, $f(x) \neq 0$ for all $x,$ so from (3),
\[f(x) = \frac{1}{x}.\]We can check that this function works, so there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution.
To obtain the fixed point, we want to eliminate $t$ in the equation
\[y = 3x^2 + tx - 2t.\]We can do so by taking $x = 2.$  This leaves us with $y = 3 \cdot 2^2 = 12,$ so the fixed point is $\boxed{(2,12)}.$
Let $y = x - 1.$  Then $x = y + 1,$ and
\[(y + 1)^4 + (-y + 1)^4 = 34.\]Expanding, we get $2y^4 + 12y^2 - 32 = 0.$  This factors as $2(y^2 - 2)(y^2 + 8) = 0,$ so $y = \pm \sqrt{2}.$  Thus, the solutions in $x$ are $\boxed{1 + \sqrt{2}, 1 - \sqrt{2}}.$
Note that $x = 3$ satisfies $3^x + 4^x + 5^x = 6^x.$  We prove that this is the only solution.
Dividing both sides by $6^x,$ we get
\[\frac{3^x}{6^x} + \frac{4^x}{6^x} + \frac{5^x}{6^x} = 1.\]Let
\[f(x) = \left( \frac{3}{6} \right)^x + \left( \frac{4}{6} \right)^x + \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^x.\]Note that the function $f(x)$ is decreasing
We know that $x = \boxed{3}$ is a solution, so it is the unique solution.
For integers $n \ge 1$ and $k \ge 0,$ if $f_{n - 1}(x) = \pm k,$ then
\[f_n(x) = |f_{n - 1}(x)| - 1 = k - 1.\]This means if $f_0(x) = \pm k,$ then $f_k(x) = 0.$
Furthermore, if $f_n(x) = 0,$ then $f_{n + 1}(x) = -1,$ and $f_{n + 2}(x) = 0.$  Hence, $f_{100}(x) = 0$ if and only if $f_0(x) = 2k$ for some integer $k,$ $-50 \le k \le 50.$
We can write
\[f_0(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
x + 200 & \text{if $x < -100$}, \\
-x & \text{if $-100 \le x < 100$}, \\
x - 200 & \text{if $x \ge 100$}.
\end{array}
\right.\][asy]
unitsize(0.01 cm);
draw((-400,-200)--(-100,100)--(100,-100)--(400,200));

label("$y = f_0(x)$", (400,200), E);
label("$(-100,100)$", (-100,100), N);
label("$(100,-100)$", (100,-100), S);
[/asy]
Thus, the equation $f_0(x) = \pm 100$ has two solutions, and the equation $f_0(x) = 2k$ has three solutions for $-49 \le k \le 49.$  Thus, the number of solutions to $f_{100}(x) = 0$ is $2 + 2 + 3 \cdot 99 = \boxed{301}.$
Let $r,$ $s,$ $t$ be the real roots, so
\[r^3 - ar^2 + br - a = 0.\]If $r$ is negative, then $r^3,$ $-ar^2,$ $br,$ and $-a$ are all negative, so
\[r^3 - ar^2 + br - a < 0,\]contradiction
Also, $r \neq 0,$ so $r$ is positive
Similarly, $s$ and $t$ are positive.
By Vieta's formulas, $r + s + t = a$ and $rst = a.$  By AM-GM,
\[\frac{r + s + t}{3} \ge \sqrt[3]{rst}.\]Then
\[\frac{a}{3} \ge \sqrt[3]{a}.\]Hence, $a \ge 3 \sqrt[3]{a},$ so $a^3 \ge 27a.$  Since $a$ is positive, $a^2 \ge 27,$ so $a \ge 3 \sqrt{3}.$
Equality occurs if and only if $r = s = t = \sqrt{3},$ so the cubic is
\[(x - \sqrt{3})^3 = x^3 - 3x^2 \sqrt{3} + 9x - 3 \sqrt{3} = 0.\]Thus, $b = \boxed{9}.$
Because $g$ is defined piecewise, we take cases
If $x < 0,$ then we have $3x + 6 = 3,$ which gives $x = -1.$ Since $-1 < 0,$ this is a valid solution
If $x \ge 0,$ then we have $2x - 13 = 3,$ which gives $x = 8.$ Since $8 \ge 0,$ this is a valid solution.
Thus, the solutions to the equation are $x = \boxed{-1, 8}.$
The remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x + 1)(x + 5)$ is of the form $ax + b.$  Thus, we can let
\[p(x) = (x + 1)(x + 5) q(x) + ax + b,\]where $q(x)$ is the quotient in the division.
By the Remainder Theorem, $p(-1) = 5$ and $p(-5) = -7.$  Setting $x = -1$ and $x = -5$ in the equation above, we get
\begin{align*}
-a + b &= 5, \\
-5a + b &= -7.
\end{align*}Solving, we find $a = 3$ and $b = 8,$ so the remainder is $\boxed{3x + 8}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
f(-x) &= \frac{5^{-x} - 1}{5^{-x} + 1} \\
&= \frac{1 - 5^x}{1 + 5^x} \\
&= -\frac{5^x - 1}{5^x + 1} \\
&= -f(x),
\end{align*}so $f(x)$ is an $\boxed{\text{odd}}$ function.
Moving all the terms to the left-hand side, we have \[\frac{1}{x(x+1)}-\frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)}-\frac13 <0.\]To solve this inequality, we find a common denominator: \[\frac{3(x+2) - 3x - x(x+1)(x+2)}{3x(x+1)(x+2)} < 0,\]which simplifies to \[\frac{6-x(x+1)(x+2)}{3x(x+1)(x+2)} < 0.\]To factor the numerator, we observe that $x=1$ makes the numerator zero, so $x-1$ is a factor of the expression
Performing polynomial division, we get \[6 - x(x+1)(x+2) = -(x-1)(x^2+4x+6).\]Therefore, we want the values of $x$ such that \[\frac{(x-1)(x^2+4x+6)}{x(x+1)(x+2)}> 0.\]Notice that $x^2+4x+6 = (x+2)^2 + 2,$ which is always positive, so this inequality is equivalent to \[f(x) = \frac{x-1}{x(x+1)(x+2)}> 0.\]To solve this inequality, we make the following sign table:\begin{tabular}{c|cccc|c} &$x$ &$x-1$ &$x+1$ &$x+2$ &$f(x)$ \\ \hline$x<-2$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$-2<x<-1$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$-1<x<0$ &$-$&$-$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$0<x<1$ &$+$&$-$&$+$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$x>1$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]\end{tabular}Putting it all together, the solutions to the inequality are \[x \in \boxed{(-\infty,-2) \cup (-1,0)\cup (1, \infty)}.\]
Let $q$ be the given quantity, $AMC+AM+MC+CA$
Notice that \[q + (A+M+C) + 1 = (A+1)(M+1)(C+1).\]By AM-GM,
\[(A + 1)(M + 1)(C + 1) \le \left[ \frac{(A + 1) + (M + 1) + (C + 1)}{3} \right]^3 = \left( \frac{A + M + C + 3}{3} \right)^3 = 125,\]so $q \le 125 - 12 - 1 = 112.$
Equality occurs when $A = M = C = 4,$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{112}.$
Because we want to find the maximum value of the expression, we can assume that both $x$ and $y$ are positive; if not, then replacing $x$ and $y$ with $|x|$ and $|y|$ would strictly increase the value of the expression.
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2)(x^2 + y^2 + 1) \ge (x + 2y + 3)^2,\]or $14(x^2 + y^2 + 1) \ge (x + 2y + 3)^2.$  Hence,
\[\frac{x + 2y + 3}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}} \le \sqrt{14}.\]Equality occurs when $x = \frac{y}{2} = \frac{1}{3},$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{\sqrt{14}}.$
The graph of $y = f(x)$ is shown below.

In particular, $0 \le f(x) \le 1$ for all $x.$  So,
\[0 \le nf(xf(x)) \le n,\]which means that all solutions to $nf(xf(x)) = x$ lie in the interval $[0,n].$
Let $a$ be an integer such that $0 \le a \le n - 1.$  Suppose $a \le x < a + \frac{1}{2}.$  Then
\[f(x) = |2 \{x\} - 1| = |2(x - a) - 1| = 1 + 2a - 2x.\]Let
\[g(x) = xf(x) = x(1 + 2a - 2x).\]Thus, we want to find the solutions to $f(g(x)) = \frac{x}{n}.$
If $a = 0,$ then
\[g(x) = x(1 - 2x),\]which satisfies $0 \le g(x) \le \frac{1}{8}$ for $0 \le x < \frac{1}{2}.$  Then
\[f(g(x)) = 1 - 2g(x) = 4x^2 - 2x + 1.\]We can check that
\[\frac{3}{4} \le 4x^2 - 2x + 1 \le 1\]for $0 \le x < \frac{1}{2}.$  But $\frac{x}{n} \le \frac{1}{2},$ so there no solutions in this case.
Otherwise, $a \ge 1.$  Suppose $a \le x < y < a + \frac{1}{2}.$  We claim that $g(x) > g(y).$  This inequality is equivalent to
\[x(1 + 2a - 2x) > y(1 + 2a - 2y),\]which in turn is equivalent to $(y - x)(2x + 2y - 2a - 1) > 0.$  Since $2x + 2y - 2a - 1 > 2a - 1 \ge 1,$ the claim $g(x) > g(y)$ is established.
This means that $g(x)$ is strictly decreasing on the interval $a \le x < a + \frac{1}{2},$ so it maps the interval $\left[ a, a + \frac{1}{2} \right)$ bijectively to the interval $(0,a].$  This means that $f(g(x))$ oscillates between 0 and 1 $2a$ times, so the line $y = \frac{x}{n}$ intersects this graph $2a$ times.
Now suppose $a + \frac{1}{2} \le x < a.$  Then
\[f(x) = |2\{x\} - 1| = |2(x - a) - 1| = 2x - 2a - 1.\]Let
\[g(x) = xf(x) = x(2x - 2a - 1).\]We can similarly establish that $g(x)$ is strictly increasing for $a + \frac{1}{2} \le x < a,$ so it maps the interval $\left[ a + \frac{1}{2}, a \right)$ bijectively to the interval $[0, a + 1).$  This means that $f(g(x))$ oscillates between 0 and 1 $2a + 2$ times, so the line $y = \frac{x}{n}$ intersects this graph $2a + 2$ times.
Therefore, the total number of solutions is
\[\sum_{a = 0}^{n - 1} (2a + 2a + 2) = 2 \sum_{a = 0}^{n - 1} (2a + 1) = 2n^2.\]Finally, the smallest such $n$ such that $2n^2 \ge 2012$ is $n = \boxed{32}.$
Using $\log x+\log y=\log xy,$ we get that $\log_{10} 40+\log_{10} 25=\log_{10}(40\cdot 25)=\log 1000.$ That means we want $x$ where $10^x=1000,$ which means $x=3.$ Therefore, $\log_{10} 40+\log_{10} 25=\boxed{3}.$
Applying the definition to the sequence $(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{99}),$ we get
\[\frac{a_1 + (a_1 + a_2) + \dots + (a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{99})}{99} = 1000.\]Thus, $99a_1 + 98a_2 + \dots + 2a_{98} + a_{99} = 99000.$
Then the Cesaro sum of $(1, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{99})$ is
\begin{align*}
\frac{1 + (1 + a_1) + (1 + a_1 + a_2) + \dots + (1 + a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{99})}{100} &= \frac{100 + 99a_1 + 98a_2 + \dots + 2a_{98} + a_{99}}{100} \\
&= \frac{100 + 99000}{100} = \frac{99100}{100} = \boxed{991}.
\end{align*}
We can write the product as
\begin{align*}
(2^{1/3})(4^{1/9})(8^{1/27})(16^{1/81}) \dotsm &= 2^{1/3} \cdot (2^2)^{1/9} \cdot (2^3)^{1/27} \cdot (2^4)^{1/81} \dotsm \\
&= 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{2/3^2} \cdot 2^{3/3^3} \cdot 2^{4/3^4} \dotsm \\
&= 2^{1/3 + 2/3^2 + 3/3^3 + 4/3^4 + \dotsb}.
\end{align*}Let
\[S = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3^2} + \frac{3}{3^3} + \frac{4}{3^4} + \dotsb.\]Then
\[3S = 1 + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{3^2} + \frac{4}{3^3} + \dotsb.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[2S = 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{3^3} + \dotsb = \frac{1}{1 - 1/3} = \frac{3}{2},\]so $S = \frac{3}{4}.$
Therefore, the infinite product is $2^{3/4} = \boxed{\sqrt[4]{8}}.$
Setting $x = 1,$ we get $f(1 + f(4)) = 4f(1),$ so
\[f(5) = 16.\]Setting $x = 5,$ we get $f(5 + f(5)) = 4f(5),$ so
\[f(21) = \boxed{64}.\]
To work with the inverse $f^{-1},$ we consider the range of each component of $f(x).$ Let $g(x) = x-2$ for $x < 4,$ and let $h(x) = \sqrt{x}$ for $x \ge 4.$ For $x < 4,$ we have $x - 2 < 2,$ so the range of $g$ is the interval $(-\infty, -2).$ For $x \ge 4,$ we have $\sqrt{x} \ge 2,$ so the range of $h$ is $[2, \infty).$
The inverse of $g$ is $g^{-1}(x) = x+2,$ while the inverse of $h$ is $h^{-1}(x) = x^2.$ To compute $f^{-1}(x),$ we must use $g^{-1}$ if $x < 2,$ and use $h^{-1}$ if $x \ge 2$: \[\begin{aligned} f^{-1}(-5) + f^{-1}(-4) + \dots + f^{-1}(4) + f^{-1}(5) &= \left(g^{-1}(-5) + \dots + g^{-1}(1)\right) + \left(h^{-1}(2) + \dots + h^{-1}(5)\right) \\ &= \left((-3) + (-2) + \dots + 3\right) + \left(4 + 9 + 16 + 25\right) \\ &= 0 + 54 \\ &= \boxed{54}
\end{aligned}\]
We are told that $1 < a < b.$  We are also told that 1, $a,$ and $b$ cannot form the sides of a triangle, so at least one of the inequalities
\begin{align*}
1 + a &> b, \\
1 + b &> a, \\
a + b &> 1
\end{align*}does not hold
We see that $1 + b > b > a$ and $a + b > a > 1,$ so the only inequality that cannot hold is $1 + a > b.$  Hence, we must have $1 + a \le b.$
Also, since $1 < a < b,$ $\frac{1}{b} < \frac{1}{a} < 1.$  Thus, we must also have
\[\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} \le 1.\]Then
\[\frac{1}{a} \le 1 - \frac{1}{b} = \frac{b - 1}{b},\]so
\[a \ge \frac{b}{b - 1}.\]Then
\[\frac{b}{b - 1} + 1 \le a + 1 \le b,\]so $b + b - 1 \le b(b - 1).$  This simplifies to
\[b^2 - 3b + 1 \ge 0.\]The roots of $b^2 - 3b + 1 = 0$ are
\[\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2},\]so the solution to $b^2 - 3b + 1 \ge 0$ is $b \in \left( -\infty, \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right] \cup \left[ \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \infty \right).$
Since $b > 1,$ the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\boxed{\frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}.$
The number of cards is $1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2},$ and the sum of the values of all cards is
\[1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \dots + n^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}.\]Therefore, the average value of a card is
\[\frac{\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}}{\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}} = \frac{2n + 1}{3}.\]Setting this to 2017 and solving, we find $n = \boxed{3025}.$
We know that $f(0) = 0,$ so from property (iii),
\[f(1) = 1 - f(0) = 1.\]Then from property (iv),
\[f \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{f(1)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.\]Then from property (iii),
\[f \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 1 - f \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.\]Property (ii) states that the function is non-decreasing
Since $f \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = f \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{1}{2},$ we can say that $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}$ for all $\frac{1}{3} \le x \le \frac{2}{3}.$  In particular, $f \left( \frac{3}{7} \right) = \frac{1}{2}.$
Then by property (iv),
\[f \left( \frac{1}{7} \right) = \frac{f(\frac{3}{7})}{2} = \frac{1}{4}.\]By property (iii),
\[f \left( \frac{6}{7} \right) = 1 - f \left( \frac{1}{7} \right) = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}.\]Finally, by property (iv),
\[f \left( \frac{2}{7} \right) = \frac{f(\frac{6}{7})}{2} = \boxed{\frac{3}{8}}.\]The properties listed in the problem uniquely determine the function $f(x).$  Its graph is shown below:

For reference, the function $f(x)$ is called the Cantor function
It is also known as the Devil's Staircase.
By the Rational Root Theorem, the only possible rational roots are of the form $\pm \frac{a}{b},$ where $a$ divides 2 and $b$ divides 4
Thus, the possible rational roots are
\[\pm 1, \ \pm 2, \ \pm \frac{1}{2}, \ \pm \frac{1}{4}.\]Checking these values, we find that the rational roots are $\boxed{2,-\frac{1}{4}}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
a_3 &= \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{3}{2}, \\
a_4 &= \frac{a_3}{a_2} = \frac{3/2}{3} = \frac{1}{2}, \\
a_5 &= \frac{a_4}{a_3} = \frac{1/2}{3/2} = \frac{1}{3}, \\
a_6 &= \frac{a_5}{a_4} = \frac{1/3}{1/2} = \frac{2}{3}, \\
a_7 &= \frac{a_6}{a_5} = \frac{2/3}{1/3} = 2, \\
a_8 &= \frac{a_7}{a_6} = \frac{2}{2/3} = 3.
\end{align*}Since $a_7 = a_1 = 2$ and $a_8 = a_2 = 3,$ and each term depends only on the previous two terms, the sequence becomes periodic at this point, with a period of length 6
Hence, $a_{2006} = a_2 = \boxed{3}.$
Let $f(x) = x^2 + bx + c,$ and let $M$ be the munificence of $f(x).$  Then $|f(-1)| \le M,$ $|f(0)| \le M$ and $|f(1)| \le M.$  These lead to
\begin{align*}
|1 - b + c| &\le M, \\
|c| &\le M, \\
|1 + b + c| & \le M.
\end{align*}Then by Triangle Inequality,
\begin{align*}
4M &= |1 - b + c| + 2|c| + |1 + b + c| \\
&= |1 - b + c| + 2|-c| + |1 + b + c| \\
&\ge |(1 - b + c) + 2(-c) + (1 + b + c)| \\
\end{align*}Hence, $M \ge \frac{1}{2}.$
Consider the quadratic $f(x) = x^2 - \frac{1}{2}.$  Then
\[-\frac{1}{2} \le x^2 - \frac{1}{2} \le \frac{1}{2}\]for $-1 \le x \le 1,$ and $|f(-1)| = |f(0)| = |f(1)| = \frac{1}{2},$ so munificence of $f(x)$ is $\frac{1}{2}.$
Therefore, the smallest possible munificence of a monic quadratic polynomial is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get
\[4(x - 3)^2 - 25(y - 5)^2 + 100 = 0.\]Then
\[\frac{(y - 5)^2}{4} - \frac{(x - 3)^2}{25} = 1,\]so the center of the hyperbola is $\boxed{(3,5)}.$
By AM-HM,
\[\frac{a + b}{2} \ge \frac{2}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}}.\]Hence,
\[\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} \ge \frac{4}{a + b} = 4.\]Equality occurs when $a = b = \frac{1}{2}.$
Note that as $a$ approaches 0 and $b$ approaches 1, $\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}$ becomes arbitrarily large
Therefore, the set of all possible values of $\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}$ is $\boxed{[4,\infty)}.$
We know that $f^{-1}(u)=v$ is the same as $u=f(v)$
Therefore $f^{-1}(g(x))=5x+3$ is the same as  \[g(x)=f(5x+3).\]We can also use that $g(s)=t$ is equivalent to $s=g^{-1}(t)$ to say \[x=g^{-1}(f(5x+3)).\]This gives an expression containing $g^{-1}\circ f$.
Now we solve: \[g^{-1}(f(-7))=g^{-1}(f(5(-2)+3)).\]If $x=-2$ the equation $g^{-1}(f(5x+3))=x$ tells us  \[g^{-1}(f(5(-2)+3))=\boxed{-2}.\]
In general, for the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1,$ the asymptotes are $\frac{x}{a} = \pm \frac{y}{b},$ or $y = \pm \frac{b}{a} x.$  Therefore, the asymptotes of the first hyperbola are $y = \pm \frac{3}{2} x.$
For the hyperbola $\frac{y^2}{a^2} - \frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1,$ the asymptotes are $\frac{y}{a} = \pm \frac{x}{b},$ or $y = \pm \frac{a}{b} x.$ Therefore, the asymptotes of the second hyperbola are $y = \pm \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{N}} x.$
For the two hyperbolas to have the same asymptotes, we must have $\frac{3}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt2}{\sqrt N}.$ Solving for $N$ gives $N = \boxed{8}.$

\[f(n) = \left\lceil \frac{99n}{100} \right\rceil - \left\lfloor \frac{100n}{101} \right\rfloor.\]Note that
\begin{align*}
f(n + 10100) &= \left\lceil \frac{99 (n + 10100)}{100} \right\rceil - \left\lfloor \frac{100 (n + 10100)}{101} \right\rfloor \\
&= \left\lceil \frac{99n}{100} + 101 \right\rceil - \left\lfloor \frac{100n}{101} + 100 \right\rfloor \\
&= \left\lceil \frac{99n}{100} \right\rceil + 101 - \left\lfloor \frac{100n}{101} \right\rfloor - 100 \\
&= \left\lceil \frac{99n}{100} \right\rceil - \left\lfloor \frac{100n}{101} \right\rfloor + 1 \\
&= f(n) + 1.
\end{align*}This implies that for each residue class $r$ modulo 10100, there is a unique integer $n$ such that $f(n) = 1$ and $n \equiv r \pmod{10100}.$  Thus, the answer is $\boxed{10100}.$
By QM-AM,
\[\sqrt{\frac{(2x + 1) + (2y + 1) + (2z + 1)}{3}} \ge \frac{\sqrt{2x + 1} + \sqrt{2y + 1} + \sqrt{2z + 1}}{3}.\]Hence,
\[\sqrt{2x + 1} + \sqrt{2y + 1} + \sqrt{2z + 1} \le \sqrt{3(2x + 2y + 2z + 3)} = \sqrt{39}.\]Equality occurs when $x = y = z = \frac{5}{3},$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{\sqrt{39}}.$
\[y = \frac{2x + 7}{x - 3}.\]Solving for $x,$ we find
\[x = \frac{3y + 7}{y - 2}.\]Thus, for any value of $y,$ we can find a corresponding value of $x,$ except $y = 2.$  Therefore, the range of the function is $\boxed{(-\infty,2) \cup (2,\infty)}.$
First, we can factor $P(z) = z^8 + (4 \sqrt{3} + 6) z^4 - (4 \sqrt{3} + 7)$ as
\[P(z) = (z^4 - 1)(z^4 + 4 \sqrt{3} + 7).\]The solutions to $z^4 - 1 = 0$ are 1, $-1,$ $i,$ and $-i$.
If $z^4 + 4 \sqrt{3} + 7 = 0,$ then
\[z^4 = -4 \sqrt{3} - 7 = (-1)(4 \sqrt{3} + 7),\]so $z^2 = \pm i \sqrt{4 \sqrt{3} + 7}.$
We try to simplify $\sqrt{4 \sqrt{3} + 7}.$  Let $\sqrt{4 \sqrt{3} + 7} = a + b.$  Squaring both sides, we get
\[4 \sqrt{3} + 7 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\]Set $a^2 + b^2 = 7$ and $2ab = 4 \sqrt{3}.$  Then $ab = 2 \sqrt{3},$ so $a^2 b^2 = 12.$  We can then take $a^2 = 4$ and $b^2 = 3,$ so $a = 2$ and $b = \sqrt{3}.$  Thus,
\[\sqrt{4 \sqrt{3} + 7} = 2 + \sqrt{3},\]and
\[z^2 = \pm i (2 + \sqrt{3}).\]We now try to find the square roots of $2 + \sqrt{3},$ $i,$ and $-i.$
Let $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}} = a + b.$  Squaring both sides, we get
\[2 + \sqrt{3} = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\]Set $a^2 + b^2 = 2$ and $2ab = \sqrt{3}.$  Then $a^2 b^2 = \frac{3}{4},$ so by Vieta's formulas, $a^2$ and $b^2$ are the roots of
\[t^2 - 2t + \frac{3}{4} = 0.\]This factors as $\left( t - \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( t - \frac{3}{2} \right) = 0,$ so $a^2$ and $b^2$ are equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{3}{2}$ in some order, so we can take $a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $b = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}.$  Hence,
\[\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (1 + \sqrt{3}).\]Let $(x + yi)^2 = i,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers
Expanding, we get $x^2 + 2xyi - y^2 = i.$  Setting the real and imaginary parts equal, we get $x^2 = y^2$ and $2xy = 1.$  Then $4x^2 y^2 = 1,$ so $4x^4 = 1.$  Thus, $x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ and the square roots of $i$ are
\[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} i = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (1 + i), \ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} i = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (1 + i).\]Similarly, we can find that the square roots of $-i$ are
\[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} i = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (1 - i), \ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} i = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (-1 + i).\]Hence, the solutions to $z^4 = -4 \sqrt{3} - 7$ are
\[\frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} (1 + i), \ -\frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} (1 + i), \ \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} (1 - i), \ \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} (-1 + i).\]We plot these, along with 1, $-1,$ $i,$ $-i$ in the complex plane.

The four complex numbers 1, $-1,$ $i,$ $-i$ form a square with side length $\sqrt{2}.$  The distance between $\frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} (1 + i)$ and 1 is
\begin{align*}
\left| \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} (1 + i) - 1 \right| &= \left| \frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} i \right| \\
&= \sqrt{\left( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{1 - 2 \sqrt{3} + 3 + 1 + 2 \sqrt{3} + 3}{4}} \\
&= \sqrt{2}.
\end{align*}Thus, each "outer" root has a distance of $\sqrt{2}$ to its nearest neighbors
So to the form the polygon with the minimum perimeter, we join each outer root to its nearest neighbors, to form an octagon with perimeter $\boxed{8 \sqrt{2}}.$
Given $k,$ suppose $|k - \sqrt{p}| < \frac{1}{2}.$  Then
\[k - \frac{1}{2} < \sqrt{p} < k + \frac{1}{2}.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[k^2 - k + \frac{1}{4} < p < k^2 + k + \frac{1}{4}.\]Thus, given $k,$ the positive integers $p$ such that $b(p) = k$ are $k^2 - k + 1,$ $k^2 - k + 2,$ $\dots,$ $k^2 + k,$ for a total of $2k$ numbers
So, these $2k$ numbers contribute $2k \cdot k = 2k^2$ to the sum.
Now, $b(2007) = 45,$ so
\begin{align*}
S &= \sum_{p = 1}^{2007} b(p) \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^{44} 2k^2 + \sum_{p = 1981}^{2007} 45 \\
&= 2 \sum_{k = 1}^{44} k^2 + 27 \cdot 45 \\
&= 2 \cdot \frac{44 \cdot 45 \cdot 89}{6} + 27 \cdot 45 \\
&= \boxed{59955}.
\end{align*}
We can factor the equation as
\[x^6 (x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379) = 0.\]Since we are looking for positive real solutions, this reduces to
\[x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379.\]Consider the function $f(x) = x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379.$  This is increasing for $x > 0.$  Also, $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) > 0,$ so there is exactly $\boxed{1}$ positive real solution, which lies in the interval $(0,1).$
The cubic equation can be rewritten as $x^3-5x^2+6x-9=0$
First, we list the relations that Vieta's formulas give us:
\begin{align*}
-(r+s+t) &= -5,\quad(\clubsuit) \\
rs+rt+st &= 6,\phantom{-}\quad(\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit}) \\
-rst &= -9.\,\quad(\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit})
\end{align*}We wish to compute
$$\frac{rs}t + \frac{rt}s + \frac{st}r = \frac{r^2s^2+r^2t^2+s^2t^2}{rst}.$$The denominator is $rst=9$
To obtain the numerator, we square equation $(\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit})$ to get
$$r^2s^2 + r^2t^2 + s^2t^2 + 2r^2st + 2rs^2t + 2rst^2 = 36.$$We can rewrite this as
$$r^2s^2 + r^2t^2 + s^2t^2 + 2rst(r+s+t) = 36.$$From equations $(\clubsuit)$ and $(\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit})$, we have
$$2rst(r+s+t) = 2\cdot 9\cdot 5 = 90,$$so
$$r^2s^2 + r^2t^2 + s^2t^2 = 36 - 90 = -54.$$Finally, we have
$$\frac{rs}t + \frac{rt}s + \frac{st}r = \frac{r^2s^2 + r^2t^2 + s^2t^2}{rst} = \frac{-54}{9} = \boxed{-6}.$$
The numerator factors as $z^3 - 1 = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) = 0.$
If $z = 1,$ then the denominator is undefined, so $z = 1$ is not a solution
On the other hand, $z^2 + z + 1 = 0$ has $\boxed{2}$ complex roots, which satisfy the given equation.
Let $g(n) = f(n) - n.$  Then $f(n) = g(n) + n,$ so
\[g(n) + n = g(n - 1) + (n - 1) - g(n - 2) - (n - 2) + n.\]This simplifies to
\[g(n) = g(n - 1) + g(n - 2) + 1.\]Also, $g(1) = 0$ and $g(2) = -1,$ so
\begin{align*}
g(3) &= (-1) - 0 + 1 = 0, \\
g(4) &= 0 - (-1) + 1 = 2, \\
g(5) &= 2 - 0 + 1 = 3, \\
g(6) &= 3 - 2 + 1 = 2, \\
g(7) &= 2 - 3 + 1 = 0, \\
g(8) &= 0 - 2 + 1 = -1.
\end{align*}Since $g(7) = g(1) = 0$ and $g(8) = g(2) = -1,$ and each term depends only on the two previous terms, the sequence $g(n)$ is periodic from here on, with a period of length 6
Therefore, $g(2018) = g(2) = -1,$ so $f(2018) = g(2018) + 2018 = \boxed{2017}.$
$(1-2) + (3-4) + \dots + (97-98) + 99 = -1\cdot 49 + 99 = \boxed{50}$.
To approach this problem, we can either use long division or synthetic division to evaluate the quotient of the given rational expression
Alternatively, we can rewrite the numerator as $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ $ = 2x^2 + 3x - 7 - 9x + 9x$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9x - 7 - 20 + 20$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9(x-3) + 20$
Hence, $$y = \frac{2x^2 + 3x - 7}{x-3} = \frac{(2x+9)(x-3) + 20}{x-3} = 2x+9 +\frac{20}{x-3}.$$As $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity, then the fraction approaches $0$, and $y$ approaches $2x + 9$.Thus, $m+b = \boxed{11}.$ [asy]

In general,
\[z \overline{z} = |z|^2\]for all complex numbers $z.$
So, if $|z| = 13,$ then $z \overline{z} = 13^2 = \boxed{169}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
f(f(x)) &= f \left( \frac{ax}{x + 1} \right) \\
&= \frac{a \cdot \frac{ax}{x + 1}}{\frac{ax}{x + 1} + 1} \\
&= \frac{a^2 x}{ax + x + 1}.
\end{align*}We want
\[\frac{a^2 x}{ax + x + 1} = x\]for $x \neq -1.$  This gives us
\[a^2 x = ax^2 + x^2 + x.\]Matching the coefficients, we get $a^2 = 1$ and $a + 1 = 0.$  Thus, $a = \boxed{-1}.$
For $1 \le N \le 1024,$ the possible values of $\lfloor \log_2 N \rfloor$ are 0, 1, 2, $\dots,$ 10
For a given value of $k,$ $0 \le k \le 10,$
\[\lfloor \log_2 N \rfloor = k\]for $N = 2^k,$ $2^{k + 1},$ $\dots,$ $2^{k + 1} - 1,$ for $2^k$ possible values
The only exception is $k = 10$: $\lfloor \log_2 N \rfloor = 10$ only for $N = 1024.$
Hence, the sum we seek is
\[S = 1 \cdot 0 + 2 \cdot 1 + 2^2 \cdot 2 + 2^3 \cdot 3 + \dots + 2^8 \cdot 8 + 2^9 \cdot 9 + 10.\]Then
\[2S = 2 \cdot 0 + 2^2 \cdot 1 + 2^3 \cdot 2 + 2^4 \cdot 3 + \dots + 2^9 \cdot 8 + 2^{10} \cdot 9 + 20.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\begin{align*}
S &= 10 + 2^{10} \cdot 9 - 2^9 - 2^8 - \dots - 2^2 - 2 \\
&= 10 + 2^{10} \cdot 9 - 2(2^8 + 2^7 + \dots + 2 + 1) \\
&= 10 + 2^{10} \cdot 9 - 2(2^9 - 1) \\
&= \boxed{8204}.
\end{align*}
Multiplying both sides by $(x - 5)(x - 3)^2,$ we get
\[4x = A (x - 3)^2 + B(x - 5)(x - 3) + C (x - 5).\]Setting $x = 5,$ we get $4A = 20,$ so $A = 5.$
Setting $x = 3,$ we get $-2C = 12,$ so $C = -6.$  Hence,
\[4x = 5(x - 3)^2 + B(x - 5)(x - 3) - 6(x - 5).\]Then
\[B(x - 5)(x - 3) = -5x^2 + 40x - 75 = -5(x - 3)(x - 5),\]so $B = -5.$  Therefore, $(A,B,C) = \boxed{(5,-5,-6)}.$
To find the standard form for the equation of the hyperbola, we complete the square in both variables: \[\begin{aligned} -(x^2+10x) + 2(y^2-8y) + 1 &= 0 \\ -(x^2+10x+25) + 2(y^2-8y+16) + 1 &= -25 + 32 \\ -(x+5)^2 + 2(y-4)^2 &= 6 \\ \frac{(y-4)^2}{3} - \frac{(x+5)^2}{6} &= 1
\end{aligned}\]This fits the standard form of the hyperbola \[\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1,\]where $a=\sqrt{3},$ $b=\sqrt{6},$ $h=-5,$ and $k=4.$ Thus, the center of the hyperbola is the point $(h,k)=(-5, 4).$ Because the $y^2$ coefficient is positive and the $x^2$ coefficient is negative, the foci are vertically aligned with the center of the hyperbola
We have \[c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{3+6} = 3,\]which is the distance from the center of the hyperbola to each focus
Therefore, the two foci of the hyperbola are $(-5, 4 \pm 3),$ which gives two points: $\boxed{(-5, 7)}$ and $\boxed{(-5, 1)}.$ (Either point is an acceptable answer.)[asy]

Factor 2001 into primes to get $2001=3\cdot 23\cdot 29$
The largest possible sum of three distinct factors whose product is the one which combines the two largest prime factors, namely $I=23\cdot
29=667$, $M=3$, and $O=1$, so the largest possible sum is $1+3+667=\boxed{671}$.
Let $k$ be a positive integer
Then for $k^2 \le x < (k + 1)^2,$
\[x \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor = kx.\]Thus, on this interval, the graph of $0 \le y \le x \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor$ is a trapezoid, with left height $k^3,$ right height $k(k + 1)^2,$ and base $(k + 1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1,$ so its area is
\[\frac{k^3 + k(k + 1)^2}{2} \cdot (2k + 1) = 2k^4 + 3k^3 + 2k^2 + \frac{k}{2}.\]Let $n$ be a positive integer such that $k^2 + 1 \le n \le (k + 1)^2.$  Then for $k^2 \le x < n,$ the graph of $0 \le y \le x \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor$ is a trapezoid with left height $k^3,$ right height $kn,$ and base $n - k^2,$ so its area is
\[\frac{k^3 + kn}{2} \cdot (n - k^2) = \frac{k(k^2 + n)(n - k^2)}{2} = \frac{k(n^2 - k^4)}{2}.\]We want to compute the area of the graph for $1 \le x \le n$; in particular, we want this area to be an integer
We know that the area for $k^2 \le x \le (k + 1)^2$ is
\[2k^4 + 3k^3 + 2k^2 + \frac{k}{2}.\]Since $2k^4 + 3k^3 + 2k^2$ is always an integer, for our purposes, we keep only the $\frac{k}{2}$ term
This gives us
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i = 1}^{k - 1} \frac{i}{2} + \frac{k(n^2 - k^4)}{2} &= \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{(k - 1)k}{2} + \frac{k(n^2 - k^4)}{2} \\
&= \frac{k(k - 1)}{4} + \frac{k(n^2 - k^4)}{2} \\
&= \frac{k[2k(n^2 - k^4) + k - 1]}{4}.
\end{align*}Thus, we want $k[2k(n^2 - k^4) + k - 1]$ to be divisible by 4
We compute $k[2k(n^2 - k^4) + k - 1]$ modulo 4 for $0 \le k \le 3$ and $0 \le n \le 3,$ and obtain the following results:
\begin{array}{c||c|c|c|c}
k \backslash n & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline \hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
1 & 2 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ \hline
2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\ \hline
3 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 2
\end{array}
\]Case 1: $k = 4m$ for some integer $m.$
All integers $n$ in the range $k^2 + 1 \le n \le (k + 1)^2$ work, for a total of $2k + 1$ integers.
Case 2: $k = 4m + 1$ for some integer $m.$
Only odd integers $n$ in the range $k^2 + 1 \le n \le (k + 1)^2$ work
These are $k^2 + 2,$ $k^2 + 4,$ $\dots,$ $(k + 1)^2 - 1,$ for a total of $k$ integers.
Case 3: $k = 4m + 2$ for some integer $m.$
No integers $n$ in the range $k^2 + 1 \le n \le (k + 1)^2$ work.
Case 4: $k = 4m + 3$ for some integer $m.$
Only even integers $n$ in the range $k^2 + 1 \le n \le (k + 1)^2$ work
These are $k^2 + 1,$ $k^2 + 3,$ $\dots,$ $(k + 1)^2,$ for a total of $k + 1$ integers.
Thus, the four cases $k = 4m + 1,$ $4m + 2,$ $4m + 3,$ and $4m + 4$ contribute
\[4m + 1 + 4m + 4 + 2(4m + 4) + 1 = 16m + 14.\]integers.
Summing over $0 \le m \le 6$ covers the cases $2 \le n \le 841,$ and gives us
\[\sum_{m = 0}^6 (16m + 14) = 434\]integers.
For $k = 29,$ which covers the cases $529 \le n \le 900,$ we have another 29 integers.
For $k = 30,$ which covers the cases $901 \le n \le 961,$ there are no integers.
For $k = 31,$ only the even integers in the range $962 \le n \le 1024$ work
We want the integers up to 1000, which are
\[962, 964, \dots, 1000,\]and there are 20 of them.
Thus, the total number of integers we seek is $434 + 29 + 20 = \boxed{483}.$
Let $a = f(2)$ and $b = f(5).$  Setting $x = 2$ and $y = 5,$ we get
\[14 = f(10) = f(2) + f(5) = a + b.\]Setting $x = 10$ and $y = 2,$ we get
\[f(20) = f(10) + f(2) = a + b + a = 2a + b.\]Setting $x = 20$ and $y = 2,$ we get
\[20 = f(40) = f(20) + f(2) = 2a + b + a = 3a + b.\]Solving the system $a + b = 14$ and $3a + b = 20,$ we find $a = 3$ and $b = 11.$  Then
\begin{align*}
f(500) &= f(2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5) \\
&= f(2) + f(2) + f(5) + f(5) + f(5) \\
&= 2 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 11 \\
&= \boxed{39}.
\end{align*}
\[S = 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2^3 + 4 \cdot 2^4 + \dots + n \cdot 2^n.\]Then
\[2S = 2 \cdot 2^3 + 3 \cdot 2^4 + 4 \cdot 2^5 + \dots + n \cdot 2^{n + 1}.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\begin{align*}
S &= (2 \cdot 2^3 + 3 \cdot 2^4 + 4 \cdot 2^5 + \dots + n \cdot 2^{n + 1}) - (2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2^3 + 4 \cdot 2^4 + \dots + n \cdot 2^n) \\
&= -2 \cdot 2^2 - 2^3 - 2^4 - \dots - 2^n + n \cdot 2^{n + 1} \\
&= -8 - 2^3 (1 + 2 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{n - 3}) + n \cdot 2^{n + 1} \\
&= -8 - 2^3 (2^{n - 2} - 1) + n \cdot 2^{n + 1} \\
&= -8 - 2^{n + 1} + 8 + n \cdot 2^{n + 1} \\
&= (n - 1) 2^{n + 1}.
\end{align*}Hence, $(n - 1) 2^{n + 1} = 2^{n + 10},$ so $n - 1 = 2^9 = 512,$ from which $n = \boxed{513}.$
By the Remainder Theorem, $P(19) = 99$ and $P(99) = 19.$
When $P(x)$ is divided by $(x - 19)(x - 99),$ the remainder must be of the form $ax + b.$  Thus,
\[P(x) = (x - 19)(x - 99) Q(x) + ax + b,\]for some polynomial $Q(x).$
Setting $x = 19$ and $x = 99,$ we get
\begin{align*}
19a + b &= P(19) = 99, \\
99a + b &= P(99) = 19.
\end{align*}Subtracting the equations, we get $80a = -80,$ so $a = -1.$  Then $-19 + b = 99,$ so $b = 118.$  Hence, the remainder is $\boxed{-x + 118}.$
From the Factor Theorem, if $x-5$ is a factor of $P$, then $P(5) = 0$
Using this we have
$$5^3+2(5^2)+5c+10 = 0.$$Solving for $c$ gives us $c = \boxed{-37}$.
From $x + 4y = 4,$ $y = -\frac{x}{4} + 1.$  Hence, the $x_i$ are the roots of
\[x^3 - 3x + 2 = -\frac{x}{4} + 1.\]Then by Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0,$ and
\[y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = -\frac{x_1}{4} + 1 - \frac{x_2}{4} + 1 - \frac{x_3}{4} + 1 = -\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3}{4}+3 = 3.\]Hence, $(A,B) = \boxed{(0,3)}.$
Note that
\[B^2 = \left( x - \frac{1}{x} \right)^2 = x^2 - 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = A - 2,\]so
\[\frac{A}{B} = \frac{B^2 + 2}{B} = B + \frac{2}{B}.\]By AM-GM,
\[B + \frac{2}{B} \ge 2 \sqrt{B \cdot \frac{2}{B}} = 2 \sqrt{2}.\]Equality occurs when $x - \frac{1}{x} = \sqrt{2}$ (which has $x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}}$ as a root), so the minimum value is $\boxed{2 \sqrt{2}}.$
Let $\frac{x}{y} = t$
Then $x = ty$, so we can write \[\frac{x-y}{x+y} = \frac{ty-y}{ty+y} = \frac{t-1}{t+1}.\]Thus, we have \[2 < \frac{t-1}{t+1} < 5,\]which we can rewrite as follows: \[\begin{aligned} 2 < 1 &- \frac{2}{t+1} < 5 \\ 1 <&-\frac{2}{t+1} < 4 \\ -\frac{1}{2} > &\frac{1}{t+1} > -2
\end{aligned}\]The only number of the form $\frac{1}{t+1}$ (where $t$ is an integer) which lies in the interval $\left(-2, -\frac12\right)$ is $-1 = \frac1{-1}$, so we must have $t+1=-1$, and $t = -2$
This is achievable when $x = -2$ and $y =1$, so the answer is $\boxed{-2}$.
The condition is equivalent to $z^2+(x+y-1)z=0$
Since $z$ is positive, $z=1-x-y$, so $x+y+z=1$
By the AM-GM inequality, $$xyz \leq \left(\frac{x+y+z}{3}\right)^3 = \boxed{\frac{1}{27}},$$with equality when $x=y=z=\frac{1}{3}$.
Complete the square by adding 1 to each side
Then $(x+1)^2 = 1+i=e^{\frac{i\pi}{4}} \sqrt{2}$, so $x+1 = \pm e^{\frac{i\pi}{8}}\sqrt[4]{2}$
The desired product is then
\begin{align*}
\left( -1+\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\sqrt[4]{2} \right) \left( -1-\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{8}\right) \sqrt[4]{2}\right) &= 1-\cos^2\left( \frac{\pi}{8}\right) \sqrt{2} \\
&= 1-\frac{\left( 1 +\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right)}{2}\sqrt{2}\\
&= \boxed{\frac{1-\sqrt{2}}{2}}.
\end{align*}
We know that $|ab|=|a|\cdot |b|$
Therefore, \[\left|\left(\frac 35+\frac 45 i\right)^6\right|=\left|\frac 35+\frac 45 i\right|^6\]Now, \[\left|\frac 35+\frac 45i\right|=\sqrt{\left(\frac 35\right)^2+\left(\frac 45\right)^2}=1\]Our answer is $1^6=\boxed{1}$.
We know that $|ab|=|a|\cdot |b|$
Therefore, \[\left|\left(1+i\right)^6\right|=\left|1+ i\right|^6\]Now, \[\left|1+i\right|=\sqrt{1^2+1^2}=\sqrt{2}\]Our answer is $(\sqrt{2})^6=2^3=\boxed{8}$.
By QM-AM, we have
$$\sqrt{\frac{(1-x_1)^2+(x_1-x_2)^2+(x_2-x_3)^2+x_3^2}{4}} \ge \frac{(1-x_1)+(x_1-x_2)+(x_2-x_3)+x_3}{4} = \frac{1}{4}.$$Taking the square of both sides, and then multiplying both sides by $4$ gives us,
$$(1-x_1)^2+(x_1-x_2)^2+(x_2-x_3)^2+x_3^2 \ge \frac{1}{4}.$$Equality occurs if and only if $1-x_1=x_1-x_2=x_2-x_3=x_3 = \frac{1}{4}$
We can solve to get $x_1 = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}},$ $x_2 = \frac{1}{2},$ and $x_3 = \frac{1}{4}.$
\[S = 1+2\left(\dfrac{1}{1998}\right)+3\left(\dfrac{1}{1998}\right)^2+4\left(\dfrac{1}{1998}\right)^3+\dotsb.\]Then
\[1998S = 1998 + 2 + \frac{3}{1998} + \frac{4}{1998^2} + \dotsb.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[1997S = 1998 + 1 + \frac{1}{1998} + \frac{1}{1988^2} + \dotsb = \frac{1998}{1 - 1/1998} = \frac{3992004}{1997},\]so $S = \boxed{\frac{3992004}{3988009}}.$
We have the factorization
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz).\]Let $A = x + y + z$ and $B = x^2 + y^2 + z^2.$  Squaring $x + y + z = A,$ we get
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + xz + yz) = A^2,\]so $xy + xz + yz = \frac{A^2 - B}{2}.$  Hence,
\[A \left( B - \frac{A^2 - B}{2} \right) = 1,\]which simplifies to $A^3 + 2 = 3AB.$
Now, by the Trivial Inequality,
\[(x - y)^2 + (x - z)^2 + (y - z)^2 \ge 0,\]which simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \ge xy + xz + yz.$  Since
\[(x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz) = 1,\]we must have $A = x + y + z > 0.$
From $A^3 + 2 = 3AB,$
\[B = \frac{A^3 + 2}{3A}.\]By AM-GM,
\[\frac{A^3 + 2}{3A} = \frac{A^3 + 1 + 1}{3A} \ge \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{A^3}}{3A} = 1,\]so $B \ge 1.$
Equality occurs when $x = 1,$ $y = 0,$ and $z = 0,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{1}.$
From the graph of $xy = 1,$ we can tell that the foci will be at the points $(t,t)$ and $(-t,-t)$ for some positive real number $t.$
unitsize(1 cm);
real func(real x) {
return(1/x);
pair P;
pair[] F;
P = (1/2,2);
F[1] = (sqrt(2),sqrt(2));
F[2] = (-sqrt(2),-sqrt(2));
draw(graph(func,1/3,3),red);
draw(graph(func,-3,-1/3),red);
draw((-3,0)--(3,0));
draw((0,-3)--(0,3));
draw(F[1]--P--F[2]);
dot("$F_1$", F[1], SE);
dot("$F_2$", F[2], SW);
dot("$P$", P, NE);
[/asy]
Thus, if $P = (x,y)$ is a point on the hyperbola, then one branch of the hyperbola is defined by
\[\sqrt{(x + t)^2 + (y + t)^2} - \sqrt{(x - t)^2 + (y - t)^2} = d\]for some positive real number $d.$  Then
\[\sqrt{(x + t)^2 + (y + t)^2} = \sqrt{(x - t)^2 + (y - t)^2} + d.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[(x + t)^2 + (y + t)^2 = (x - t)^2 + (y - t)^2 + 2d \sqrt{(x - t)^2 + (y - t)^2} + d^2.\]This simplifies to
\[4tx + 4ty - d^2 = 2d \sqrt{(x - t)^2 + (y - t)^2}.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\begin{align*}
&16t^2 x^2 + 16t^2 y^2 + d^4 + 32t^2 xy - 8d^2 tx - 8d^2 ty \\
&= 4d^2 x^2 - 8d^2 tx + 4d^2 y^2 - 8d^2 ty + 8d^2 t^2.
\end{align*}We can cancel some terms, to get
\[16t^2 x^2 + 16t^2 y^2 + d^4 + 32t^2 xy = 4d^2 x^2 + 4d^2 y^2 + 8d^2 t^2.\]We want this equation to simplify to $xy = 1.$  For this to occur, the coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$ on both sides must be equal, so
\[16t^2 = 4d^2.\]Then $d^2 = 4t^2,$ so $d = 2t.$  The equation above becomes
\[16t^4 + 32t^2 xy = 32t^4.\]Then $32t^2 xy = 16t^4,$ so $xy = \frac{t^2}{2}.$  Thus, $t = \sqrt{2},$ so the distance between the foci $(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2})$ and $(-\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2})$ is $\boxed{4}.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 4^{\frac{1}{4}} \cdot 8^{\frac{1}{8}} \cdot 16^{\frac{1}{16}} \dotsm &= 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{2 \cdot \frac{1}{4}} \cdot 2^{3 \cdot \frac{1}{8}} \cdot 2^{4 \cdot \frac{1}{16}} \dotsm \\
&= 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{4} + \frac{3}{8} + \frac{4}{16} + \dotsb}.
\end{align*}Let
\[S = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{4} + \frac{3}{8} + \frac{4}{16} + \dotsb.\]Then
\[2S = 1 + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{3}{4} + \frac{4}{8} + \dotsb.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[S = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \dotsb = \frac{1}{1 - 1/2} = 2,\]so
\[2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 4^{\frac{1}{4}} \cdot 8^{\frac{1}{8}} \cdot 16^{\frac{1}{16}} \dotsm = 2^S = 2^2 = \boxed{4}.\]
Subtracting the given equations, we get
\[10x - 10y - 71 = 0.\]Note that $A$ and $B$ must satisfy this equation, which is conveniently a line, so this equation represents line $AB.$  We see that the slope is $\boxed{1}.$
Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers
Then $|z| = 5$ becomes $x^2 + y^2 = 25,$ and $f(z) = z$ becomes
\[i(x - yi) = x + yi.\]Then $ix + y = x + yi,$ so $x = y.$
Hence, $2x^2 = 25,$ which has two solutions
Thus, there are $\boxed{2}$ such values of $z.$
Notice that each term can be written as \[ \frac{1}{n (n+1)} = \frac{1}{n} -\frac{1}{n+1}.\] This can be obtained by setting  \[\frac{1}{n (n+1)} = \frac{A}{n} + \frac{B}{n+1} \] for some unknown values of $A$ and $B,$ and then cross multiplying to solve for $A$ and $B.$ From this point, we see that $-\frac{1}{n+1}$ of each term cancels with $\frac{1}{n}$ of the next term, and so the sum is $1 - \frac{1}{(9)+1} = \boxed{\frac{9}{10}}.$
First we use the formula $\log_a{b}=\frac{\log_c{b}}{\log_c{a}}$
The given expression becomes
$$\log_{y^6}{x}\cdot\log_{x^5}{y^2}\cdot\log_{y^4}{x^3}\cdot\log_{x^3}{y^4}\cdot\log_{y^2}{x^5}=\frac{\log{x}}{\log{y^6}}\cdot\frac{\log{y^2}}{\log{x^5}}\cdot\frac{\log{x^3}}{\log{y^4}}\cdot\frac{\log{y^4}}{\log{x^3}}\cdot\frac{\log{x^5}}{\log{y^2}}$$Next we use the formula $a\log_b{x}=\log_b{x^a}$
We get
\begin{align*}
\frac{\log{x}}{\log{y^6}}\cdot\frac{\log{y^2}}{\log{x^5}}\cdot\frac{\log{x^3}}{\log{y^4}}\cdot\frac{\log{y^4}}{\log{x^3}}\cdot\frac{\log{x^5}}{\log{y^2}} &= \frac{\log{x}}{6\log{y}}\cdot\frac{2\log{y}}{5\log{x}}\cdot\frac{3\log{x}}{4\log{y}}\cdot\frac{4\log{y}}{3\log{x}}\cdot\frac{5\log{x}}{2\log{y}} \\
&= \frac{120\log{x}}{720\log{y}} \\
&= \frac{\log{x}}{6\log{y}} = \frac16 \log_y{x}.
\end{align*}Therefore, $a=\boxed{\frac16}$.
Since $x^2 + x + 1$ is a factor of $(x^2 + x + 1)(x - 1) = x^3 - 1,$ and so also a factor of $x(x^3 - 1) = x^4 - x,$ the remainder when $(x^4 - 1)(x^2 - 1)$ is divided by $x^2 + x + 1$ is the same as the remainder of
\[(x - 1)(x^2 - 1) = x^3 - x^2 - x + 1.\]This has the same remainder when $1 - x^2 - x + 1 = -x^2 - x + 2 = -(x^2 + x + 1) + 3$ is divided by $x^2 + x + 1,$ which is $\boxed{3}.$
We can write the given equation as
\[\log_{10} (k - 2)! + \log_{10} (k - 1)! + \log_{10} 100 = \log_{10} (k!)^2.\]Then
\[\log_{10} [100 (k - 2)! (k - 1)!] = \log_{10} (k!)^2,\]so $100 (k - 2)! (k - 1)! = (k!)^2.$  Then
\[100 = \frac{k! \cdot k!}{(k - 2)! (k - 1)!} = k(k - 1) \cdot k = k^3 - k^2.\]So, $k^3 - k^2 - 100 = 0,$ which factors as $(k - 5)(k^4 + 4k + 20) = 0.$  The quadratic factor has no integer roots, so $k = \boxed{5}.$
The sum and product of the zeros of $P(x)$ are $-a$ and $-c$, respectively
Therefore, $$-\frac{a}{3}=-c=1+a+b+c.$$Since $c=P(0)$ is the $y$-intercept of $y=P(x)$, it follows that $c=2$
Thus $a=6$ and $b = \boxed{-11}$.
\[k = \frac{a^3 + 6}{a} = \frac{b^3 + 6}{b} = \frac{c^3 + 6}{c}.\]Then $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are all roots of
\[k = \frac{x^3 + 6}{x},\]or $x^3 - kx + 6 = 0.$  By Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c = 0.$
\begin{align*}
a^3 - ka + 6 &= 0, \\
b^3 - kb + 6 &= 0, \\
c^3 - kc + 6 &= 0.
\end{align*}Adding these, we get $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - k(a + b + c) + 18 = 0,$ so $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = k(a + b + c) - 18 = \boxed{-18}.$
If we were to expand the given equation and move all the terms to the left-hand side, we would have a $x^2$ term and a $-16y^2$ term
Because the coefficients of the $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms have opposite signs, this conic section must be a $\boxed{(\text{H})}$ hyperbola.
We can factor by pairing $x^5$ and $-x,$ and $-x^2$ and $-1$:
\begin{align*}
x^5 - x^2 - x - 1 &= (x^5 - x) - (x^2 + 1) \\
&= x(x^4 - 1) - (x^2 + 1) \\
&= x(x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) - (x^2 + 1) \\
&= (x^2 + 1)(x^3 - x - 1).
\end{align*}If $x^3 - x - 1$ factors further, then it must have a linear factor, which means it has an integer root
By the Integer Root Theorem, the only possible integer roots are $\pm 1,$ and neither of these work, so $x^3 - x - 1$ is irreducible.
Thus, $(x^2 + 1)(x^3 - x - 1)$ is the complete factorization
Evaluating each factor at 2, we get $(2^2 + 1) + (2^3 - 2 - 1) = \boxed{10}.$
Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers such that $\langle n \rangle = k.$  Then
\[k - \frac{1}{2} < \sqrt{n} < k + \frac{1}{2},\]or
\[k^2 - k + \frac{1}{4} < n < k^2 + k + \frac{1}{4}.\]Thus, for a given positive integer $k,$ the values of $n$ such that $\langle n \rangle = k$ are $n = k^2 - k + 1,$ $k^2 - k + 2,$ $\dots,$ $k^2 + k.$  Thus, we can re-write the sum as
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{2^{\langle n \rangle} + 2^{-\langle n \rangle}}{2^n} &= \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{n = k^2 - k + 1}^{k^2 + k} \frac{2^{\langle n \rangle} + 2^{-\langle n \rangle}}{2^n} \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^\infty (2^k + 2^{-k}) \left( \frac{1}{2^{k^2 - k + 1}} + \frac{1}{2^{k^2 - k + 2}} + \dots + \frac{1}{2^{k^2 + k}} \right) \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^\infty (2^k + 2^{-k}) \cdot \frac{2^{2k - 1} + 2^{2k - 2} + \dots + 1}{2^{k^2 + k}} \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^\infty (2^k + 2^{-k}) \cdot \frac{2^{2k} - 1}{2^{k^2 + k}} \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^\infty (2^{-k^2 + 2k} - 2^{-k^2 - 2k}) \\
&= (2^1 - 2^{-3}) + (2^0 - 2^{-8}) + (2^{-3} - 2^{-15}) + (2^{-8} - 2^{-24}) + \dotsb \\
&= \boxed{3}.
\end{align*}
If a polynomial has real coefficients, then any complex conjugate of a root must also be a root
Hence, the other root is $1 + i.$  Thus, the polynomial is
\[(x - 1 - i)(x - 1 + i) = (x - 1)^2 - i^2 = \boxed{x^2 - 2x + 2}.\]
Because the coefficients of the polynomial are rational, the radical conjugate of $3-\sqrt{7}$, which is $3+\sqrt{7}$, must also be a root of the polynomial
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this polynomial is $0$; since $(3-\sqrt{7}) + (3+\sqrt{7}) = 6,$ the third, integer root must be $0 - 6 = \boxed{-6}.$
Let $S$ be the value of the given expression
Using sum and difference of cubes to factor, we get \[\begin{aligned} S &= \dfrac{(2-1)(2^2+2+1)}{(2+1)(2^2-2+1)}\cdot\dfrac{(3-1)(3^2+3+1)}{(3+1)(3^2-3+1)} \cdot\dfrac{(4-1)(4^2+4+1)}{(4+1)(4^2-4+1)}\cdot\dfrac{(5-1)(5^2+5+1)}{(5+1)(5^2-5+1)}\cdot\dfrac{(6-1)(6^2+6+1)}{(6+1)(6^2-6+1)} \\ &= \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{4}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{7} \cdot \frac{2^2+2+1}{2^2-2+1} \cdot \frac{3^2+3+1}{3^2-3+1} \cdot \frac{4^2+4+1}{4^2-4+1} \cdot \frac{5^2+5+1}{5^2-5+1} \cdot \frac{6^2+6+1}{6^2-6+1}.\end{aligned}\]The first product telescopes to $\tfrac{1 \cdot 2}{6 \cdot 7} = \tfrac{1}{21}$
The second product also telescopes due to the identity \[x^2 + x + 1 = (x+1)^2 - (x+1) + 1.\]That is, the terms $2^2+2+1$ and $3^2-3+1$ cancel, as do the terms $3^2+3+1$ and $4^2-4+1$, and so on, leaving just $\tfrac{6^2+6+1}{2^2-2+1} = \tfrac{43}{3}$
Thus, \[S = \frac{1}{21} \cdot \frac{43}{3} = \boxed{\frac{43}{63}}.\]
We use the two identities $a\log_b{x}=\log_b{x^a}$ and $\log_b{x}+\log_b{y}=\log_b{xy}$
The given expression becomes \begin{align*}
\log_{10}{4}+2\log_{10}{5}+3\log_{10}{2}+6\log_{10}{5}+\log_{10}{8}&=\log_{10}{2^2}+\log_{10}{5^2}+\log_{10}{2^3}+\log_{10}{5^6}+\log_{10}{2^3} \\
&=\log_{10}{(2^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 2^3 \cdot 5^6 \cdot 2^3)}\\
&=\log_{10}{(2^8 \cdot 5^8)} \\
&=\log_{10}{10^8} \\
&=\boxed{8}.
\end{align*}
We start by substituting $u=\sqrt{4x-3}$
Then it is easy to solve for $u$:
\begin{align*}
u + \frac{10}{u} &= 7 \\
u^2 + 10 &= 7u \\
u^2 - 7u + 10 &= 0 \\
(u - 5)(u - 2) &= 0
\end{align*}Thus, we must have $u = 2$ or $u = 5$.
If $u = 2$, we get $\sqrt{4x - 3} = 2$, so $4x - 3 = 4$ and $x = \frac{7}{4}$.
If $u = 5$, we get $\sqrt{4x - 3} = 5$ and so $4x - 3 = 25$, yielding $x = 7$.
Thus our two solutions are $x=\boxed{\frac 74,7}$.
The sum is taken over all positive integers $n$ and $k$ such that $k \le n - 1,$ or $n \ge k + 1.$  Thus, we can change the order of summation:
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{k}{2^{n+k}} &= \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{n = k + 1}^\infty \frac{k}{2^{n + k}} \\
&= \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k}{2^k} \sum_{n=k+1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{k}{2^k} \left( \frac{1}{2^{k + 1}} + \frac{1}{2^{k + 2}} + \dotsb \right) \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{k}{2^k} \cdot \frac{1}{2^k} \\
&= \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k}{4^k}.
\end{align*}Let
\[S = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{k}{4^k} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4^2} + \frac{3}{4^3} + \dotsb.\]Then
\[4S = 1 + \frac{2}{4} + \frac{3}{4^2} + \frac{4}{3^3} + \dotsb.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[3S = 1 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4^2} + \dotsb = \frac{4}{3},\]so $S = \boxed{\frac{4}{9}}.$
First, we can reduce each fraction, to get
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \dotsm \frac{667}{668}.\]This simplifies to $\boxed{\frac{1}{668}}.$
Setting $b = 0$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[f(a) = f(a) + f(0) - 2f(0),\]so $f(0) = 0.$
Setting $b = 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[f(a + 1) = f(a) + f(1) - 2f(a) = f(1) - f(a).\]Then
\begin{align*}
f(a + 2) &= f(1) - f(a + 1) \\
&= f(1) - [f(1) - f(a)] \\
&= f(a).
\end{align*}Therefore, $f(1986) = f(1984) = \dots = f(2) = f(0) = \boxed{0}.$
Since the candle is $119$ centimeters tall, the time the candle takes to burn down is \[T = \sum_{k=1}^{119} 10k = 10 \cdot \frac{119 \cdot 120}{2} = 71400.\]We want to compute the height of the candle at time $\tfrac{T}{2} = 35700$ seconds
Suppose that, at this time, the first $m$ centimeters have burnt down completely, but not the $(m+1)$st centimeter completely
Then we must have \[\sum_{k=1}^m 10k \le 35700 < \sum_{k=1}^{m+1} 10k\](the first quantity is the time it takes for the first $m$ centimeters to burn down; the last is the time it takes for the first $(m+1)$ centimeters to burn down)
This simplifies to \[5m(m+1) \le 35700 < 5(m+1)(m+2).\]To find $m$, we note that we should have $5m^2 \approx 35700$, or $m^2 \approx 7140$, so $m \approx 85$
Trying values of $m$, we find that when $m=84$, \[5m(m+1) = 35700\]exactly
Therefore, at time $\tfrac{T}{2}$, exactly the first $84$ centimeters have burnt down, and nothing more, so the height of the remaining part of the candle is $119 - 84 = \boxed{35}$ centimeters.
Let $z = 3x + 4y.$  Then $y = \frac{z - 3x}{4}.$  Substituting into $x^2 + y^2 = 14x + 6y + 6,$ we get
\[x^2 + \left( \frac{z - 3x}{4} \right)^2 = 14x + 6 \cdot \frac{z - 3x}{4} + 6.\]This simplifies to
\[25x^2 - 6xz + z^2 - 152x - 24z - 96 = 0.\]Writing this as a quadratic in $x,$ we get
\[25x^2 - (6z + 152) x + z^2 - 24z - 96 = 0.\]This quadratic has real roots, so its discriminant is nonnnegative
This gives us
\[(6z + 152)^2 - 4 \cdot 25 \cdot (z^2 - 24z - 96) \ge 0.\]This simplifies to $-64z^2 + 4224z + 32704 \ge 0,$ which factors as $-64(z + 7)(z - 73) \ge 0.$  Therefore, $z \le 73.$
Equality occurs when $x = \frac{59}{5}$ and $y = \frac{47}{5},$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{73}.$
Since both quadratics have real roots, we must have $a^2 \ge 8b$ and $4b^2 \ge 4a,$ or $b^2 \ge a.$  Then
\[b^4 \ge a^2 \ge 8b.\]Since $b > 0,$ it follows that $b^3 \ge 8,$ so $b \ge 2.$  Then $a^2 \ge 16,$ so $a \ge 4.$
If $a = 4$ and $b = 2,$ then both discriminants are nonnegative, so the smallest possible value of $a + b$ is $\boxed{6}.$
Let $2a$ and $2b$ be the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse, respectively, and let the dimensions of the rectangle be $x$ and $y.$ Then $x+y$ is the sum of the distances from the foci to point $A$ on the ellipse, which is $2a,$ so $x+y=2a.$ Also, the length of a diagonal of the rectangle is $\sqrt{x^2+y^2},$ which is also equal to the distance between the foci of the ellipse, which is $2\sqrt{a^2-b^2}.$ Thus, $x^2+y^2 = 4(a^2-b^2).$ Then the area of the rectangle is \[
2006=xy=r\frac{1}{2}\displaystyle\left[(x+y)^2-(x^2+y^2)\displaystyle\right]=r\frac{1}{2}\displaystyle\left[(2a)^2-(4a^2-4b^2)\displaystyle\right]=2b^2,
\]so $b=\sqrt{1003}.$ Thus, the area of the ellipse is \[
2006\pi=\pi ab=\pi a\sqrt{1003}.
\]Thus, $a=2\sqrt{1003},$ and the perimeter of the rectangle is $2(x+y)=4a=\boxed{8\sqrt{1003}}.$

Multiplying both sides by $x(x-2),$ we get \[2x^2 + (2x^2-24)(x-2) = 11x(x-2),\]which simplifies to \[2x^3 - 13x^2 - 2x + 48 = 0.\]Looking for rational roots to the equation, we see that $x=6$ is a solution
Performing the polynomial division, we get \[2x^3 - 13x^2 - 2x + 48 = (x-6)(2x^2-x-8) = 0,\]so either $x = 6$ or $2x^2 - x - 8 =0.$ The latter quadratic has solutions \[x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{65}}{4},\]so the smallest root of the original equation is $x = \boxed{\frac{1-\sqrt{65}}{4}}.$
By the Remainder Theorem,
\begin{align*}
-5 &= f(1) = a - 6 + b - 5, \\
-53 &= f(-2) = -8a - 24 - 2b - 5.
\end{align*}Solving, we find $(a,b) = \boxed{(2,4)}.$
If two parabolas have the same focus, and their directrices intersect, then the parabolas intersect in exactly two points.
Suppose two parabolas have the same focus and their directrices are parallel
If the focus lies between the two directrices, then the parabolas again intersect in exactly two points
However, if the focus does not between the two directrices, then the parabolas do not intersect.
There are $\binom{30}{2}$ ways to choose a pair of parabolas
In terms of $a$ and $b,$ the parabolas do not intersect when their slopes $a$ are the same, and their $b$-values have the same sign (because this is when the focus does not lie between the two directrices)
There are five ways to choose the value of $a,$ and $\binom{3}{2} + \binom{3}{2} = 6$ ways to choose the values of $b$ (either both are negative or both are positive)
Hence, the total number of intersection points is
\[2 \left( \binom{30}{2} - 5 \cdot 6 \right) = \boxed{810}.\]
By Factor Theorem, the polynomial will become 0 when $x = -2$ and $x = 1.$  Thus,
\begin{align*}
(-2)^5 - (-2)^4 + (-2)^3 - p(-2)^2 + q(-2) + 4 &= 0, \\
1 - 1 + 1 - p + q + 4 &= 0.
\end{align*}Then $-4p - 2q = 52$ and $-p + q = -5.$  Solving, we find $(p,q) = \boxed{(-7,-12)}.$
\[S_m = \sum_{n = 1}^m \frac{n^2 + n - 1}{(n + 2)!}.\]We compute the first few sums $S_m$:
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{array}{c|c}
m & S_m \\ \hline
1 & \frac{1}{6} \\
2 & \frac{3}{8} \\
3 & \frac{7}{15} \\
4 & \frac{71}{144} \\
5 & \frac{419}{840}
\end{array}
\]We note that the fractions seem to be approaching $\frac{1}{2},$ so we also compute $\frac{1}{2} - S_m$:
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
m & S_m & \frac{1}{2} - S_m \\ \hline
1 & \frac{1}{6} & \frac{1}{3} \\
2 & \frac{3}{8} & \frac{1}{8} \\
3 & \frac{7}{15} & \frac{1}{30} \\
4 & \frac{71}{144} & \frac{1}{144} \\
5 & \frac{419}{840} & \frac{1}{840}
\end{array}
\]We can relate the fractions $\frac{1}{2} - S_m$ to factorials in the following way:
\[\frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3!}, \ \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{4!}, \ \frac{1}{30} = \frac{4}{5!}, \ \frac{1}{144} = \frac{5}{6!}, \ \frac{1}{840} = \frac{6}{7!}.\]Thus, we conjecture that
\[S_m = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{m + 1}{(m + 2)!}.\]So, let
\[T_n = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{n + 1}{(n + 2)!}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
T_n - T_{n - 1} &= \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{n + 1}{(n + 2)!} \right) - \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{n}{(n + 1)!} \right) \\
&= \frac{n}{(n + 1)!} - \frac{n + 1}{(n + 2)!} \\
&= \frac{n(n + 2) - (n + 1)}{(n + 2)!} \\
&= \frac{n^2 + n - 1}{(n + 2)!},
\end{align*}which is exactly what we are summing.
From the identity
\[\frac{n}{(n + 1)!} - \frac{n + 1}{(n + 2)!} = \frac{n^2 + n - 1}{(n + 2)!},\]we have that
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{n^2 + n - 1}{(n + 2)!} &= \left( \frac{1}{2!} - \frac{2}{3!} \right) + \left( \frac{2}{3!} - \frac{3}{4!} \right) + \left( \frac{3}{4!} - \frac{4}{5!} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.
\end{align*}
Let $r_1, r_2, \dots, r_{2018}$ be the roots
By Vieta's formulas, $r_1+r_2+\dots+r_{2018}=0.$ To get the squared terms we want, we square both sides, giving \[(r_1^2+r_2^2+\dots+r_{2018}^2) + 2(r_1r_2+r_1r_3+\dotsb) = 0,\]where the second term on the left-hand side is the sum of all terms $r_ir_j,$ where $i < j.$ By Vieta's formulas, this also equals $0,$ so \[r_1^2+r_2^2+\dots+r_{2018}^2=\boxed{0}\,.\]
Setting $a = b = 0,$ we get
\[2f(0) = f(0)^2 + 1.\]Then $f(0)^2 - 2f(0) + 1 = (f(0) - 1)^ 2 = 0,$ so $f(0) = 1.$
Setting $a = 1$ and $b = -1,$ we get
\[f(0) + f(-1) = f(1) f(-1) + 1,\]so $f(-1) (f(1) - 1) = 0.$  This means either $f(-1) = 0$ or $f(1) = 1.$
First, we look at the case where $f(1) = 1.$  Setting $b = 1,$ we get
\[f(a + 1) + f(a) = f(a) + 1,\]so $f(a + 1) = 1.$  This means $f(n) = 1$ for all integers $n.$
Next, we look at the case where $f(-1) = 0.$  Setting $a = b = -1,$ we get
\[f(-2) + f(1) = f(-1)^2 + 1 = 1.\]Setting $a = 1$ and $b = -2,$ we get
\[f(-1) + f(-2) = f(1) f(-2) + 1,\]which simplifies to $f(-2) = f(1) f(-2) + 1.$  Substituting $f(-2) = 1 - f(1),$ we get
\[1 - f(1) = f(1) (1 - f(1)) + 1,\]which simplifies to $f(1)^2 - 2f(1) = f(1) (f(1) - 2) = 0.$  Hence, either $f(1) = 0$ or $f(1) = 2.$
First, we look at the case where $f(1) = 0.$  Setting $b = 1,$ we get
\[f(a + 1) + f(a) = 1,\]so $f(a + 1) = 1 - f(a).$  This means $f(n)$ is 1 if $n$ is even, and 0 if $n$ is odd.
Next, we look at the case where $f(1) = 2.$  Setting $b = 1,$ we get
\[f(a + 1) + f(a) = 2f(a) + 1,\]so $f(a + 1) = f(a) + 1.$  Combined with $f(1) = 2,$ this means $f(n) = n + 1$ for all $n.$
Thus, there a total of $\boxed{3}$ functions: $f(n) = 1$ for all $n,$ $f(n) = n + 1$ for all $n,$ and
\[f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
1 & \text{if $n$ is even}, \\
0 & \text{if $n$ is odd}.
\end{array}
\right.\]We check that all three functions work.
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
4x^5 + 5x^{-4} &= x^5 + x^5 + x^5 + x^5 + x^{-4} + x^{-4} + x^{-4} + x^{-4} + x^{-4} \\
&\ge 9 \sqrt[9]{(x^5)^4 \cdot (x^{-4})^5} \\
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{9}.$
By Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c = -3,$ so $P(-3) = -16.$
Let $Q(x) = P(x) + x + 3.$  Then
\begin{align*}
Q(a) &= b + c + a + 3 = 0, \\
Q(b) &= a + c + b + 3 = 0, \\
Q(c) &= a + b + c + 3 = 0, \\
Q(-3) &= P(-3) - 3 + 3 = -16.
\end{align*}Hence, $Q(x) = k(x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = k(x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 7)$ for some constant $k.$  Setting $x = -3,$ we get
\[-16 = -8k,\]so $k = 2.$  Then $Q(x) = 2(x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 7),$ so
\[P(x) = Q(x) - x - 3 = 2(x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 7) - x - 3 = \boxed{2x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + 11}.\]
Let $d$ be the common difference, and let $r$ be the common ratio, so $d$ and $r$ are positive integers
Then $a_n = 1 + (n - 1) d$ and $b_n = r^{n - 1},$ so
\begin{align*}
1 + (k - 2) d + r^{k - 2} &= 100, \\
1 + kd + r^k &= 1000.
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
(k - 2) d + r^{k - 2} &= 99, \\
kd + r^k &= 999.
\end{align*}From the second equation, $r^k < 999.$  If $k \ge 4,$ then $r < 999^{1/4},$ so $r \le 5.$
Since the geometric sequence is increasing, $r \neq 1,$ so the possible values of $r$ are 2, 3, 4, and 5
We can write the equations above as
\begin{align*}
(k - 2) d &= 99 - r^{k - 2}, \\
kd &= 999 - r^k.
\end{align*}Thus, $99 - r^{k - 2}$ is divisible by $k - 2,$ and $999 - r^k$ is divisible by $k.$
If $r = 2,$ then the only possible values of $k$ are 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8
We find that none of these values work.
If $r = 3,$ then the only possible values of $k$ are 4, 5, and 6
We find that none of these values work.
If $r = 4,$ then the only possible values of $k$ is 4
We find that this value does not work.
If $r = 4,$ then the only possible values of $k$ is 4
We find that this value does not work.
Therefore, we must have $k = 3,$ so
\begin{align*}
d + r &= 99, \\
3d + r^3 &= 999.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $d = 99 - r.$  Substituting, we get
\[3(99 - r) + r^3 = 999,\]so $r^3 - 3r - 702 = 0.$  This factors as $(r - 9)(r^2 + 9r + 78) = 0,$ so $r = 9,$ so $d = 90.$  Then $a_3 = 1 + 2 \cdot 90 = 181$ and $c_3 = 9^2 = 81,$ and $c_3 = 181 + 81 = \boxed{262}.$
If $x^2-x-1$ is a factor of $ax^{17}+bx^{16}+1,$ then both the roots of $x^2-x-1$ must also be roots of $ax^{17}+bx^{16}+1.$ Let $s$ and $t$ be the roots of $x^2-x-1.$ Then we must have \[as^{17} + bs^{16} + 1 = at^{17} + bt^{16} + 1 = 0.\]Since $s$ is a root of $s^2-s-1=0,$ we have $s^2=s+1.$ This equation lets us express higher powers of $s$ in the form $Ms+N,$ for constants $M$ and $N.$ We have \[\begin{aligned} s^3 &= s^2 \cdot s = (s+1)s = s^2+s=(s+1)+s=2s+1, \\ s^4 &= s^3 \cdot s = (2s+1)s = 2s^2 + s = 2(s+1) + s = 3s+2, \\ s^5 &= s^4 \cdot s =(3s+2)s = 3s^2+2s=3(s+1)+2s=5s+3, \end{aligned}\]and so on
Seeing a pattern, we guess that \[s^n = F_ns + F_{n-1},\]where $\{F_n\}$ are the Fibonacci numbers (with $F_1 = F_2 = 1,$ and $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \ge 3$)
We can prove this formula with induction (see below)
This means that \[s^{16} = F_{16}s + F_{15} = 987s + 610 \; \text{ and } \; s^{17} = F_{17}s + F_{16} = 1597s + 987.\]Thus, \[as^{17} + bs^{16} + 1 = (1597a+987b)s + (987a+610b) + 1,\]so it must be the case that $1597a + 987b = 0$ and $987a + 610b =- 1.$ This system has solutions $a = \boxed{987}$ and $b = -1597.$
Proof of formula: We already did the base cases of the induction
If $s^n = F_ns + F_{n-1}$ for some value of $n,$ then \[\begin{aligned} s^{n+1} = s^n \cdot s &= (F_ns + F_{n-1}) \cdot s \\ &= F_ns^2 + F_{n-1}s\\ & = F_n(s+1) + F_{n-1}s\\ & = (F_n+F_{n-1})s + F_n = F_{n+1}s + F_n
\end{aligned}\]This completes the inductive step
$\square$
Multiplying both sides by $(x+1)(x+2),$ we get \[x(x+2) + x(x+1) = kx(x+1)(x+2),\]or \[2x^2 + 3x = kx^3 + 3kx^2 + 2kx.\]This rearranges to the equation \[0 = kx^3 + (3k-2)x^2 + (2k-3)x,\]or \[0 = x(kx^2 + (3k-2)x + (2k-3)).\]Clearly $x = 0$ is a root of this equation
All the other roots must satisfy the equation \[0 = kx^2 + (3k-2)x + (2k-3).\]If $k = 0,$ then the equation becomes $-2x - 3 = 0,$ so $x = -\frac{3}{2}.$  Thus, $k = 0$ works.
Otherwise, the $x^2$ coefficient of the right-hand side is nonzero, so the equation is a proper quadratic equation
For the given equation to have exactly two roots, one of the following must be true:
The quadratic has $0$ as a root, and the other root is nonzero
Setting $x = 0,$ we get $0 = 2k-3,$ so $k = \tfrac32.$ This is a valid solution, because then the equation becomes $0 = \tfrac32 x^2 + \tfrac52 x,$ which has roots $x = 0$ and $x = -\tfrac53.$
The quadratic has two equal, nonzero roots
In this case, the discriminant must be zero: \[(3k-2)^2 - 4k(2k-3) = 0,\]which simplifies to just $k^2 + 4 = 0.$ Thus, $k = \pm 2i.$ These are both valid solutions, because we learned in the first case that $k = \tfrac32$ is the only value of $k$ which makes $0$ a root of the quadratic; thus, the quadratic has two equal, nonzero roots for $k = \pm 2i.$
The possible values for $k$ are $k = \boxed{0,\tfrac32, 2i, -2i}.$
From the equation $a^3 + b^3 = a + b,$
\[(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = a + b.\]Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $a + b$ is positive, so we can cancel the factors of $a + b$ to get
\[a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1.\]Then
\[\frac{a^2 + b^2 - 1}{ab} = \frac{ab}{ab} = \boxed{1}.\]
Multiplying both sides by $(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 5),$ we get
\[x^2 - 7 = A(x - 3)(x - 5) + B(x - 2)(x - 5) + C(x - 2)(x - 3).\]Setting $x = 2,$ we get $3A = -3,$ so $A = -1.$
Setting $x = 3,$ we get $-2B = 2,$ so $B = -1.$
Setting $x = 5,$ we get $6C = 18,$ so $C = 3.$  Thus, $(A,B,C) = \boxed{(-1,-1,3)}.$
For $n \ge 3,$ we have that
\[a_n = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{n - 1}}{n - 1},\]or
\[(n - 1) a_n = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{n - 1}.\]Likewise,
\[n a_{n + 1} = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{n - 1} + a_n.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[n a_{n + 1} - (n - 1) a_n = a_n,\]so $n a_{n + 1} = n a_n.$  Then $a_{n + 1} = a_n.$
This means that the terms $a_3,$ $a_4,$ $a_5,$ $\dots$ are all equal
In particular, $a_3 = 99,$ so
\[\frac{19 + a_2}{2} = 99.\]We find $a_2 = \boxed{179}.$
We see that the center of the ellipse is $(2,-3),$ and that the major axis lies along the line $x = 2.$  Since the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis, one end-point of the major axis must be $(2,0),$ and the other end-point must be $(2,-6).$  Thus, the length of the major axis is $\boxed{6}.$

Dividing $x^4 + 2$ by $x - 2,$ we get
\[x^4 + 2 = (x - 2)(x^3 + 2x^2 + 4x + 8) + 18.\]Dividing $x^3 + 2x^2 + 4x + 8$ by $x - 2,$ we get
\[x^3 + 2x^2 + 4x + 8 = (x - 2)(x^2 + 4x + 12) + 32.\]Thus,
\begin{align*}
x^4 + 2 &= (x - 2)(x^3 + 2x^2 + 4x + 8) + 18 \\
&= (x - 2)((x - 2)(x^2 + 4x + 12) + 32) + 18 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 (x^2 + 4x + 12) + 32(x - 2) + 18 \\
&= (x  -2)^2 (x^2 + 4x + 12) + 32x - 46,
\end{align*}so the remainder is $\boxed{32x - 46}.$
Subtracting $\frac{1}{30}$ from both sides, we get
\[\frac{1}{x - 1} - \frac{4}{x - 2} + \frac{4}{x - 3} - \frac{1}{x - 4} - \frac{1}{30} < 0.\]Putting everything over a common denominator, we get
\[\frac{-x^4 + 10x^3 - 5x^2 - 100x - 84}{30(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)} < 0,\]which factors as
\[-\frac{(x + 2)(x + 1)(x - 6)(x - 7)}{(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)} < 0.\]We can build a sign chart, but since all of the factors are linear, we can track what happens to the expression as $x$ increases
At $x = -3,$ the expression is negative
As $x$ increases past $-2,$ the expression becomes positive
As $x$ increases past $-1,$ the expression becomes negative, and so on
Thus, the solution is
\[x \in \boxed{(-\infty,-2) \cup (-1,1) \cup (2,3) \cup (4,6) \cup (7,\infty)}.\]
We can write
\begin{align*}
f(4) &= f(3) + f(1) \\
&= f(2) + f(1) + f(1) \\
&= f(1) + f(1) + f(1) + f(1),
\end{align*}so $4f(1) = 5,$ which means $f(1) =\frac{5}{4}.$  Therefore,
\[f(5) = f(1) + f(4) = 5 + \frac{5}{4} = \boxed{\frac{25}{4}}.\]
We know that $\omega^3 - 1 = 0,$ which factors as $(\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0.$  Since $\omega$ is not real, $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0.$
\[(1 - \omega + \omega^2)^4 + (1 + \omega - \omega^2)^4 = (-2 \omega)^4 + (-2 \omega^2)^4 = 16 \omega^4 + 16 \omega^8.\]Since $\omega^3 = 1,$ this reduces to $16 \omega + 16 \omega^2 = 16(\omega^2 + \omega) = \boxed{-16}.$
Let $n$ be a positive integer
Setting $x = 0,$ $1,$ $2,$ $\dots,$ $n - 1,$ we get
\begin{align*}
f(1) - f(0) &= 6 \cdot 0 + 4, \\
f(2) - f(1) &= 6 \cdot 1 + 4, \\
f(3) - f(2) &= 6 \cdot 2 + 4, \\
&\dots, \\
f(n) - f(n - 1) &= 6 \cdot (n - 1) + 4.
\end{align*}Adding all the equations, we get
\[f(n) - f(0) = 6 (0 + 1 + 2 + \dots + (n - 1)) + 4n = 6 \cdot \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} + 4n = 3n^2 + n.\]Since this holds for all positive integers $n,$
\[f(x) = 3x^2 + x + c\]for some constant $c.$  Hence, the leading coefficient of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{3}.$
By Vieta's formulas, $r + s = \sqrt{5}$ and $rs = 1.$  Squaring the equation $r + s = \sqrt{5},$ we get
\[r^2 + 2rs + s^2 = 5,\]so $r^2 + s^2 = 5 - 2rs = 3.$  Squaring this equation, we get
\[r^4 + 2r^2 s^2 + s^4 = 9,\]so $r^4 + s^4 = 9 - 2r^2 s^2 = 9 - 2 = 7.$  Squaring once more, we get
\[r^8 + 2r^4 s^4 + s^8 = 49,\]so $r^8 + s^8 = 49 - 2r^4 s^4 = \boxed{47}.$
The given equation is not a polynomial equation, so we can't use Vieta's formulas directly
To create a related polynomial equation, we substitute $y = \sqrt{x},$ or $x = y^2,$ giving \[y^3 - 6y^2 + 7y - 1 = 0.\]For each value of $y$ which satisfies this equation, the corresponding value of $x$ which satisfies the original equation is $x = y^2.$ Therefore, we want to find the sum of the squares of the roots of this equation.
To do this, let $r,$ $s,$ and $t$ denote the roots of this equation
Then by Vieta's formulas, $r+s+t=6$ and $rs+st+tr=7,$ so \[r^2+s^2+t^2=(r+s+t)^2-2(rs+st+tr) = 6^2 - 2 \cdot 7 = \boxed{22}.\]
Notice that $$\frac{2^{2^k}}{4^{2^k} - 1} = \frac{2^{2^k} + 1}{4^{2^k} - 1} - \frac{1}{4^{2^k} - 1} = \frac{1}{2^{2^k}-1} - \frac{1}{4^{2^k}-1} = \frac{1}{4^{2^{k-1}}-1} - \frac{1}{4^{2^k}-1}.$$Therefore, the sum telescopes as $$\left(\frac{1}{4^{2^{-1}}-1} - \frac{1}{4^{2^0}-1}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4^{2^0}-1} - \frac{1}{4^{2^1}-1}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4^{2^1}-1} - \frac{1}{4^{2^2}-1}\right) + \cdots$$and evaluates to $1/(4^{2^{-1}}-1) = \boxed{1}$.
For $x \ge 2,$
\begin{align*}
\zeta(x) &= 1 + \frac{1}{2^x} + \frac{1}{3^x} + \dotsb \\
&\le 1 + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \dotsb \\
&< 1 + \frac{1}{1 \cdot 2} + \frac{1}{2 \cdot 3} + \dotsb \\
&= 1 + \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} \right) + \dotsb \\
\end{align*}so $\lfloor \zeta(x) \rfloor = 1.$  Then
\[\{\zeta(x)\} = \zeta(x) - 1.\]Thus, we want to sum
\[\sum_{k = 2}^\infty (\zeta(2k - 1) - 1) = \sum_{k = 2}^\infty \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^{2k - 1}}.\]We switch the order of summation, to get
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \sum_{k = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^{2k - 1}} &= \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^3} + \frac{1}{n^5} + \frac{1}{n^7} + \dotsb \right) \\
&= \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1/n^3}{1 - 1/n^2} \\
&= \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3 - n}.
\end{align*}By partial fractions,
\[\frac{1}{n^3 - n} = \frac{1/2}{n - 1} - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1/2}{n + 1}.\]Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3 - n} &= \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1/2}{n - 1} - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1/2}{n + 1} \right) \\
&= \left( \frac{1/2}{1} - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1/2}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{1/2}{2} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1/2}{4} \right) + \left( \frac{1/2}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1/2}{5} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \frac{1/2}{1} - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1/2}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}.
\end{align*}
Setting $x = y = 1,$ we get
\[f(1)^2 - f(1) = 2,\]so $f(1)^2 - f(1) - 2 = 0.$  This factors as $(f(1) + 1)(f(1) - 2) = 0,$ so $f(1) = -1$ or $f(1) = 2.$
Setting $y = 1,$ we get
\[f(x) f(1) - f(x) = x + 1\]for all $x.$  Then $f(x) (f(1) - 1) = x + 1.$  Since $f(1) \neq 1,$ we can write
\[f(x) = \frac{x + 1}{f(1) - 1}.\]If $f(1) = -1,$ then
\[f(x) = \frac{x + 1}{-2},\]and we can check that this function does not work.
If $f(1) = 2,$ then
\[f(x) = x + 1\]and we can check that this function works.
Therefore, $n = 1$ and $s = 3,$ so $n \times s = \boxed{3}.$
We recognize the number $\sqrt[3]{7} + \sqrt[3]{49}$ from the difference-of-cubes factorization \[7 - 1 = \left(\sqrt[3]{7} - 1\right)\left(1 + \sqrt[3]{7} + \sqrt[3]{49}\right).\]Solving for $\sqrt[3]{7} + \sqrt[3]{49},$ we get \[\sqrt[3]{7} + \sqrt[3]{49} = \frac{7-1}{\sqrt[3]{7}-1} - 1 = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}-1} - 1.\]We can use this expression to build a polynomial which has $\sqrt[3]{7} + \sqrt[3]{49}$ as a root
First, note that $\sqrt[3]{7}$ is a root of $x^3 - 7 = 0.$ Then, $\sqrt[3]{7}-1$ is a root of $(x+1)^3 - 7 = 0,$ because $(\sqrt[3]{7}-1+1)^3 - 7 = (\sqrt[3]{7})^3 - 7 = 0.$ (You could also note that the graph of $y=(x+1)^3-7$ is a one-unit leftward shift of the graph of $y=x^3-7,$ so the roots of $(x+1)^3-7=0$ are one less than the roots of $x^3-7=0.$)
It follows that $\frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}-1}$ is a root of the equation \[\left(\frac{6}{x}+1\right)^3 - 7= 0,\]because when $x = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}-1},$ we have $\frac{6}{x} = \sqrt[3]{7}-1.$ We multiply both sides by $x^3$ to create the polynomial equation \[(6+x)^3 - 7x^3 = 0.\]Finally, replacing $x$ with $x+1$ like before, we see that $\frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}-1} - 1$ is a root of the equation \[(7+x)^3 - 7(x+1)^3 = 0.\]This equation is equivalent to \[x^3 - 21x - 56 = 0,\]so by Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is $\boxed{56}.$
To get started, we compute the first ten terms as: \[ 2007, 2008, -4014, 2008, 2009, -4013, 2009, 2010, -4012, 2010, \ldots \]It appears that each term is 1 greater than the number three terms previous
We can demonstrate that this will always occur using the given recurrence relation
We know that $a_n+a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}=n$ and that $a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}+a_{n+3}=n+1$
Subtracting the former from the latter yields $a_{n+3}-a_n=1$, which is the pattern that we observed
Therefore we find that \[ a_1 = 2007, \ a_4=2008, \ a_7=2009, \ldots, a_{1000}=2007+333=\boxed{\mathbf{2340}}
The polynomial $P(x)\cdot R(x)$ has degree 6, so $Q(x)$ must have degree 2
Therefore $Q$ is uniquely determined by the ordered triple $(Q(1), Q(2),Q(3))$
When $x = 1$, 2, or 3, we have
\[0 = P(x)\cdot R(x) = P\left(Q(x)\right).\]It follows that $(Q(1), Q(2), Q(3))$ is one of the 27 ordered triples $(i, j, k)$, where $i$, $j$, and $k$ can be chosen from the set $\{1, 2, 3\}$.
However, the choices $(1, 1, 1)$, $(2, 2, 2)$, $(3, 3, 3)$, $(1, 2, 3)$, and $(3, 2, 1)$ lead to polynomials $Q(x)$ defined by $Q(x) = 1$, $2,$ $3,$ $x,$ and $4-x$, respectively, all of which have degree less than 2
The other $\boxed{22}$ choices for $(Q(1),Q(2),Q(3))$ yield non-collinear points, so in each case $Q(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial.
We have that
\[\left(\frac{2}{\cancel{3}}\right)\left(\frac{\cancel{3}}{\cancel{4}}\right)\left(\frac{\cancel{4}}{\cancel{5}}\right)\left(\frac{\cancel{5}}{6}\right)=\frac{2}{6}=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}
Because the hyperbola has center at $(0,0)$ and intersects the $x-$axis at $(-2,0)$, it must open horizontally, and $(-2,0)$ must be one of its vertices
Therefore, it has an equation of the form \[\frac{x^2}{2^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\]for some $b>0.$ Setting $x=-3$ and $y=4,$ we get the equation \[\frac{9}{4} - \frac{16}{b^2} = 1,\]which gives $b^2 = \frac{64}{5}.$ Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is \[\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{5y^2}{64} = 1.\]Setting $x=t$ and $y=2,$ we get \[\frac{t^2}{4} - \frac{5}{16} = 1,\]which gives $t^2= \boxed{\frac{21}{4}}.$[asy]

By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the three roots is $r+s+t=0$
Thus, we can write \[(r+s)^3 + (s+t)^3 + (t+r)^3 = (-t)^3 + (-r)^3 + (-s)^3 = -(r^3+s^3+t^3).\]Since each root satisfies the given equation, we have \[8r^3 + 1001r + 2008 = 0,\]so $r^3 = -\frac{1001}{8}r - 251$
Similar equations hold for $s$ and $t$
Thus, \[-(r^3+s^3+t^3) = \frac{1001}{8}(r+s+t) + 3 \cdot 251.\]Since $r+s+t=0,$ the answer is $3 \cdot 251 = \boxed{753}$.
We claim that if $F_a,$ $F_b,$ $F_c$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence, then $(a,b,c)$ must be of the form $(n,n + 2,n + 3)$ for some positive integer $n.$  (The only exception is $(2,3,4).$)
From $F_c - F_b = F_b - F_a,$ we get
\[F_c = F_b + (F_b - F_a) < F_b + F_{b + 1} = F_{b + 2}.\]Also, $F_c > F_b.$  Therefore, $F_c = F_{b + 1}.$
\begin{align*}
F_a &= 2F_b - F_c \\
&= 2F_b - F_{b + 1} \\
&= F_b - (F_{b + 1} - F_b) \\
&= F_b - F_{b - 1} \\
&= F_{b - 2}.
\end{align*}Then $a$ must be equal to $b - 2$ (unless $b = 3,$ which leads to the exceptional case of $(2,3,4)$)
Taking $n = b - 2,$ we get $(a,b,c) = (n,n + 2,n + 3).$
Then $a + (a + 2) + (a + 3) = 2000,$ so $a = \boxed{665}.$
From the given equation, $x^3 y^3 - x^3 - y^3 = 3x^2 y^2,$ or
\[x^3 y^3 - x^3 - y^3 - 3x^2 y^2 = 0.\]We have the factorization
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc).\]Taking $a = xy,$ $b = -x,$ and $c = -y,$ we get
\[x^3 y^3 - x^3 - y^3 - 3x^2 y^2 = (xy - x - y)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) = 0.\]If $xy - x - y = 0,$ then
\[(x - 1)(y - 1) = xy - x - y + 1 = 1.\]If $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc = 0,$ then $2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 - 2ab - 2ac - 2bc = 0,$ which we can write as
\[(a - b)^2 + (a - c)^2 + (b - c)^2 = 0.\]This forces $a = b = c,$ so $xy = -x = -y.$  We get that $x = y,$ so $x^2 + x = x(x + 1) = 0.$  Hence, $x = 0$ or $x = -1.$  From the given condition, we cannot have $x = 0,$ so $x = -1,$ and $y = -1,$ so $(x - 1)(y - 1) = 4.$
Thus, the possible values of $(x - 1)(y - 1)$ are 1 and 4, and their sum is $\boxed{5}.$
Let $S = r^2 + 2r^5 + 3r^8 + 4r^{11} + \dotsb.$  Then
\[r^3 S = r^5 + 2r^8 + 3r^{11} + 4r^{13} + \dotsb.\]Subtracting this equation from $S = r^2 + 2r^5 + 3r^8 + 4r^{11} + \dotsb,$ we get
\[S (1 - r^3) = r^2 + r^5 + r^8 + r^{11} + \dotsb = \frac{r^2}{1 - r^3}.\]Hence,
\[S = \frac{r^2}{(1 - r^3)^2}.\]Since $r^3 + \frac{2}{5} r - 1 = 0,$ $1 - r^3 = \frac{2}{5} r.$  Therefore,
\[S = \frac{r^2}{\frac{4}{25} r^2} = \boxed{\frac{25}{4}}.\]
Subtracting $\sqrt{x}$ from both sides and then squaring, we get \[x+2 = (10-\sqrt x)^2 = x - 20\sqrt x + 100.\]Therefore, $20\sqrt x = 98,$ so $\sqrt x = \frac{98}{20} = \frac{49}{10}.$ Therefore, $x = \left(\frac{49}{10}\right)^2 = \boxed{\frac{2401}{100}},$ or $x = 24.01.$

\]Since the degree of $2x-8$ is lower than that of $x^2+7x-5$, we cannot divide any further
So our remainder is $\boxed{2x-8}$.
We read that $a^2 = 99,$ so $a = \sqrt{99} = 3 \sqrt{11}.$  Therefore, the distance between the vertices is $2a = \boxed{6 \sqrt{11}}.$
Note that the left hand side of the second equation can be factored: $(x^2 - 2x + 1)xy = (x - 1)^2xy = 101000$
We are given that $x = 101$, so we have $(101- 1)^2(101)y = 1010000y = 101000$
It follows that $y = \boxed{\frac{1}{10}}$.
To get the equation of the asymptotes, we replace the $1$ on the right-hand side with $0,$ giving the equation\[\frac{x^2}{100} - \frac{y^2}{64} = 0.\](Notice that there are no points $(x, y)$ which satisfy both this equation and the given equation, so as expected, the hyperbola never intersects its asymptotes.) This is equivalent to $\frac{x^2}{100} = \frac{y^2}{64},$ or $\frac{y}{8} = \pm \frac{x}{10}.$ Thus, $y = \pm \frac{4}{5} x,$ so $m = \boxed{\frac45}.$[asy]

By logarithm identities, we have \[\log_2 (s^3) = \log_2 (3s).\]Thus, $s^3 = 3s$, and since $s$ must be positive, we can divide by $s$ to get $s^2 = 3.$ Thus, $s = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}.$
We could use the quadratic formula, but there is a shortcut: note that if the quadratic is not a perfect square, the solutions will be of the form $p \pm \sqrt{q}$ or $p \pm i \sqrt{q}$
In the first case, if both solutions are real, there are 2 different values of $|z|$, whereas in the second case, there is only one value, since $|p + i\sqrt{q}| = |p - i\sqrt{q}| = \sqrt{p^2 + q}$
So all we have to do is check the sign of the discriminant: $b^2 - 4ac = 64 - 4(37) < 0$
Since the discriminant is negative, there are two nonreal solutions, and thus only $\boxed{1}$ possible value for the magnitude.
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(y^2 + x^2)(3x^2 + y^2) \ge (xy \sqrt{3} + xy)^2,\]so
\[\frac{\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)(3x^2 + y^2)}}{xy} \ge 1 + \sqrt{3}.\]Equality occurs when $\frac{y^2}{3x^2} = \frac{x^2}{y^2},$ or $y = x \sqrt[4]{3},$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{1 + \sqrt{3}}.$
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\[(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \ge (ax + by + cz)^2.\]This becomes $25 \cdot 36 \ge 30^2.$  Since $25 \cdot 36 = 900 = 30^2,$ we get equality.
From the equality condition in Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{a}{x} = \frac{b}{y} = \frac{c}{z}.\]Let
\[k = \frac{a}{x} = \frac{b}{y} = \frac{c}{z}.\]Then $a = kx,$ $b = ky$ and $c = kz,$ so
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = k^2 x^2 + k^2 y^2 + k^2 z^2 = k^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2).\]Then $36k^2 = 25,$ so $k^2 = \frac{25}{36},$ which means $k = \frac{5}{6}.$  Therefore,
\[\frac{a + b + c}{x + y + z} = \boxed{\frac{5}{6}}.\]
We have that
\[(x^2 + 2x + 5)(x^2 + bx + c) = x^4 + Px^2 + Q.\]for some coefficients $b$ and $c.$  Expanding, we get
\[x^4 + (b + 2) x^3 + (2b + c + 5) x^2 + (5b + 2c) x + 5c = x^4 + Px^2 + Q.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
b + 2 &= 0, \\
2b + c + 5 &= P, \\
5b + 2c &= 0, \\
5c &= Q.
\end{align*}Solving $b + 2 = 0$ and $5b + 2c = 0,$ we get $b = -2$ and $c = 5.$  Then $P = 2b + c + 5 = 6$ and $Q = 5c = 25,$ so $P + Q = \boxed{31}.$
By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is the negation of the constant term divided by the leading ($x^3$) coefficient
Therefore, the answer is \[\frac{-28}{1} = \boxed{-28}.\]
This problem illustrates how algebra can clarify arithmetic
Comparing these quantities directly is a chore
Instead, we note that the first and third choices are both of the form $\frac{n}{n-1}+\frac{n}{n+1}$ for $n=2006$ and $n=2007$
Rewriting this expression algebraically leads to \[ \frac{n(n+1)}{n^2-1}+\frac{n(n-1)}{n^2-1} = \frac{2n^2}{n^2-1} = 2 + \frac{2}{n^2-1}
\]In particular both $A$ and $C$ are larger than 2
It is easy to verify that choice $B$ is equal to 2, so it cannot be the answer
Finally, note that larger values of $n$ produce smaller results, implying that $\boxed{\text{A}}$ is the largest
(It is also possible to guess the answer by trying examples involving much smaller numbers.)
Let $\alpha$ be a root of $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0,$ so
\[\alpha^4 + \alpha^3 + \alpha^2 + \alpha + 1 = 0.\]Then $(\alpha - 1)(\alpha^4 + \alpha^3 + \alpha^2 + \alpha + 1) = 0,$ which simplifies to $\alpha^5 = 1.$  Then
\begin{align*}
\alpha^{44} + \alpha^{33} + \alpha^{22} + \alpha^{11} + 1 &= (\alpha^5)^8 \cdot \alpha^4 + (\alpha^5)^6 \cdot \alpha^3 + (\alpha^5)^4 \cdot \alpha^2 + (\alpha^5)^2 \cdot \alpha + 1 \\
&= \alpha^4 + \alpha^3 + \alpha^2 + \alpha + 1 \\
\end{align*}Since the first polynomial is 0 for every root $\alpha$ of the second polynomial, the first polynomial is divisible by the second polynomial, which means the remainder is $\boxed{0}.$
Let one of the points of tangency be $(a,a^2).$  By symmetry, other point of tangency is $(-a,a^2).$  Also by symmetry, the center of the circle lies on the $y$-axis
Let the center be $(0,b),$ and let the radius be $r.$
unitsize(1.5 cm);
real func (real x) {
return(x^2);
pair A = (1,1), O = (0,3/2);

The equation of the parabola is $y = x^2.$  The equation of the circle is $x^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2.$  Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[x^2 + (x^2 - b)^2 = r^2.\]This expands as
\[x^4 + (1 - 2b)x^2 + b^2 - r^2 = 0.\]Since $(a,a^2)$ and $(-a,a^2)$ are points of tangency, $x = a$ and $x = -a$ are double roots of this quartic
In other words, it is the same as
\[(x - a)^2 (x + a)^2 = (x^2 - a^2)^2 = x^4 - 2a^2 x^2 + a^4 = 0.\]Equating the coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
1 - 2b &= -2a^2, \\
b^2 - r^2 &= a^4.
\end{align*}Then $2b - 2a^2 = 1.$  Therefore, the difference between the $y$-coordinates of the center of the circle $(0,b)$ and the point of tangency $(a,a^2)$ is
\[b - a^2 = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.\]
$$f(-x) = \frac{3}{2(-x)^{6}-5} = \frac{3}{2x^{6}-5} = f(x)$$Hence $f$ is $\boxed{\text{even}}.$
Because $(-1)^k$ equals 1 if $k$ is even and $-1$ if $k$ is odd, the sum can be written as \[
(-1+1)+(-1+1)+\cdots+(-1+1) =0+0+\cdots+0=\boxed{0}.
We can write
\[\frac{x^2}{x - 8} = \frac{x^2 - 64 + 64}{x - 8} = \frac{(x - 8)(x + 8) + 64}{x - 8} = x + 8 + \frac{64}{x - 8} = x - 8 + \frac{64}{x - 8} + 16.\]By AM-GM,
\[x - 8 + \frac{64}{x - 8} \ge 2 \sqrt{(x - 8) \cdot \frac{64}{x - 8}} = 16,\]so
\[\frac{x^2}{x - 8} \ge 32.\]Equality occurs when $x = 16,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{32}.$
First, we can multiply the factors $x + 5$ and $x + 12$ to get
\[(x + 5)(x + 12) = x^2 + 17x + 60.\]We can then multiply the factors $x + 6$ and $x + 10$ to get
\[(x + 6)(x + 10) = x^2 + 16x + 60.\]So, let $u = x^2 + 16x + 60.$  Then
\begin{align*}
4(x + 5)(x + 6)(x + 10)(x + 12) - 3x^2 &= 4(u + x)(u) - 3x^2 \\
&= 4u^2 + 4ux - 3x^2 \\
&= (2u + 3x)(2u - x) \\
&= (2(x^2 + 16x + 60) + 3x)(2(x^2 + 16x + 60) - x) \\
&= (2x^2 + 35x + 120)(2x^2 + 31x + 120) \\
&= \boxed{(2x^2 + 35x + 120)(x + 8)(2x + 15)}.
\end{align*}
We have that
\[(n + i)^2 = n^2 + 2ni + i^2 = (n^2 - 1) + (2n)i,\]and
\[(n + i)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2 i + 3ni^2 + i^3 = (n^3 - 3n) + (3n^2 - 1)i.\]By the Shoelace Theorem, area of the triangle with vertices $(n,1),$ $(n^2 - 1,2n),$ and $(n^3 - 3n,3n^2 - 1)$ is
\begin{align*}
&\frac{1}{2} \left|(n)(2n) + (n^2 - 1)(3n^2 - 1) + (n^3 - 3n)(1) - (1)(n^2 - 1) - (2n)(n^3 - 3n) - (3n^2 - 1)(n)\right| \\
&= \frac{1}{2} (n^4 - 2n^3 + 3n^2 - 2n + 2) = \frac{1}{2} [(n^2 - n + 1)^2 + 1].
\end{align*}Thus, we want $n$ to satisfy
\[\frac{1}{2} [(n^2 - n + 1)^2 + 1] > 2015,\]or $(n^2 - n + 1)^2 > 4029.$  Checking small values, we find the smallest positive integer $n$ that works is $\boxed{9}.$
We have $\left|{-4+\frac{7}{6}i}\right|=\frac{1}{6}|{-24+7i}|=\frac{1}{6}\sqrt{(-24)^2+7^2}=\boxed{\frac{25}{6}}$
Let $z$ be a member of the set $T$
Then $z = w - \frac{1}{w}$ for some complex number $w$ with absolute value $3$
We can rewrite $z$ as
$$z = w - \frac{1}{w} = w - \frac{\overline{w}}{|w|^2}= w - \frac{\overline{w}}{9}.$$Let $w=x+iy$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers
Then we have
$$z = x+iy - \frac{x-iy}{9} =\frac{8x + 10iy}{9}.$$This tells us that to go from $w$ to $z$ we need to stretch the real part by a factor of $\frac{8}{9}$ and the imaginary part by a factor of $\frac{10}{9}$.
$T$ includes all complex numbers formed by stretching a complex number of absolute value $3$ in this way
Since all complex numbers of absolute value $3$ form a circle of radius $3$, $T$ is an ellipse formed by stretching a circle of radius $3$ by a factor of $\frac{8}{9}$ in the $x$ direction and by a factor of $\frac{10}{9}$ in the $y$ direction
Therefore, the area inside $T$ is
$$\frac{8}{9}\cdot\frac{10}{9}\cdot9\pi = \boxed{\frac{80}{9}\pi}.$$
Let $a$ denote the zero that is an integer
Because the coefficient of $x^3$ is 1, there can be no other rational zeros, so the two other zeros must be $\frac{a}{2} \pm r$ for some irrational number $r$
The polynomial is then \[(x-a) \left( x - \frac{a}{2} - r \right) \left( x - \frac{a}{2} + r \right) = x^3 - 2ax^2 + \left( \frac{5}{4}a^2 - r^2 \right) x - a \left( \frac{1}{4}a^2 - r^2 \right).\]Therefore $a=1002$ and the polynomial is \[x^3 - 2004 x^2 + (5(501)^2 - r^2)x - 1002((501)^2-r^2).\]All coefficients are integers if and only if $r^2$ is an integer, and the zeros are positive and distinct if and only if $1 \leq r^2
\leq 501^2 - 1 = 251000$
Because $r$ cannot be an integer, there are $251000 - 500 = \boxed{250500}$ possible values of $n$.
The long division is shown below.
\begin{array}{c|cc cc}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{7x^2} & -11x & +17  \\
\cline{2-5}
x + 2 & 7x^3 & +3x^2&-5x&-8  \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{7x^3} & +14x^2& \\
\cline{2-3}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & -11x^2& -5x\\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & -11x^2& -22x\\
\cline{3-4}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & +17x & -8 \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & +17x & +34 \\
\cline{4-5}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & & -42 \\
\end{array}
\]Thus, the quotient is $\boxed{7x^2 - 11x + 17}.$
Using the property $\log_a b^x = x \log_a b,$ we have \[\begin{aligned} \frac 2{\log_4{2000^6}} + \frac 3{\log_5{2000^6}} &= \frac{2}{6\log_4 2000} + \frac{3}{6\log_5 2000} \\ &= \frac{1}{3\log_4 2000} + \frac{1}{2\log_5 2000}
\end{aligned}\]Since $\log_a b = \frac1{\log_b a}$, we can then write \[\frac{1}{3\log_4 2000} + \frac{1}{2\log_5 2000} = \frac{1}{3}\log_{2000} 4 + \frac{1}{2}\log_{2000} 5,\]which equals \[\log_{2000} (4^{1/3} 5^{1/2})= \log_{2000} (2^{2/3} 5^{1/2}).\]Since $2000 = 2^4 5^3 = \left(2^{2/3} 5^{1/2}\right)^6$, the expression $\boxed{\tfrac{1}{6}}$.
Since $p(-7) = p(4) = 0,$ the quadratic polynomial $p(x)$ is of the form
\[p(x) = c(x + 7)(x - 4),\]for some constant $c.$  To find $c,$ we set $x = 5,$ and use the fact that $p(5) = -36$:
\[-36 = c(12)(1),\]so $c = -3.$  Hence, $p(x) = -3(x + 7)(x - 4) = \boxed{-3x^2 - 9x + 84}.$
Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get
\[(x + 3)^2 + 4(y - 1)^2 = 4.\]Then
\[\frac{(x + 3)^2}{4} + \frac{(y - 1)^2}{1} = 1,\]so the semi-major axis is 2, the semi-minor axis is 1, and the area is then $\boxed{2 \pi}.$
Let $a_n$ denote the $n$th term
\[\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{2008}}{2008} = 2008,\]so $a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{2008} = 2008^2.$
\[\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{2007}}{2007} = 2007,\]so $a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{2007} = 2007^2.$  Subtracting these equations, we get
\[a_{2008} = 2008^2 - 2007^2 = (2008 + 2007)(2008 - 2007) = \boxed{4015}.\]
From the given recursion,
\[a_{n + 1} = \frac{a_n}{a_{n - 1}}.\]Let $a = a_1$ and $b = a_2.$  Then
\begin{align*}
a_3 &= \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{b}{a}, \\
a_4 &= \frac{a_3}{a_2} = \frac{b/a}{b} = \frac{1}{a}, \\
a_5 &= \frac{a_4}{a_3} = \frac{1/a}{b/a} = \frac{1}{b}, \\
a_6 &= \frac{a_5}{a_4} = \frac{1/b}{1/a} = \frac{a}{b}, \\
a_7 &= \frac{a_6}{a_5} = \frac{a/b}{1/b} = a, \\
a_8 &= \frac{a_7}{a_6} = \frac{a}{a/b} = b.
\end{align*}Since $a_7 = a = a_1$ and $a_8 = b = a_2,$ and each term depends only on the two previous terms, the sequence is periodic from here on
Furthermore, the length of the period is 6
Therefore, $a_6 = a_{1776} = 13 + \sqrt{7}$ and $a_{2009} = a_5.$  Also, $a_7 = a_1,$ and
\[a_7 = \frac{a_6}{a_5}.\]Hence,
\[a_5 = \frac{a_6}{a_7} = \frac{13 + \sqrt{7}}{1 + \sqrt{7}} = \frac{(13 + \sqrt{7})(\sqrt{7} - 1)}{(1 + \sqrt{7})(\sqrt{7} - 1)} = \frac{-6 + 12 \sqrt{7}}{6} = \boxed{-1 + 2 \sqrt{7}}.\]
To say that $k = (a_3a_2a_1a_0)_{-3+i}$ is to say that \[k = a_3(-3+i)^3 + a_2(-3+i)^2 + a_1(-3+i) + a_0.\]Expanding the right-hand side, we have  \[k = (-18a_3+8a_2-3a_1+a_0) + (26a_3-6a_2+a_1)i.\]Since $k$ is a real number, the imaginary part of the right-hand side must be zero; that is, \[26a_3 - 6a_2 + a_1 = 0\]or \[26a_3 = 6a_2 - a_1.\]Remember that $0 \le a_1, a_2, a_3\le 9$, so $6a_2 - a_1 \le 6 \cdot 9 - 0 = 54$
Thus, $26a_3 \le 54$, so $a_3 \le 2$
We take cases, remembering that $a_3 \neq 0$:
If $a_3 = 1$, then we have $6a_2 - a_1 = 26$
The only solution to this equation is $(a_1, a_2) = (4, 5)$, so we have \[k = -18a_3 + 8a_2 - 3a_1 + a_0 = -18 \cdot 1 + 8 \cdot 5 -3 \cdot 4 + a_0 = 10 + a_0.\]Since $a_0 \in \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9\}$, the possible values of $k$ are $10, 11, 12, \ldots, 19$, and these have a sum \[10 + 11 + 12 + \dots + 19 = \frac{29 \cdot 10}{2} = 145.\]
If $a_3 = 2$, then we have $6a_2 - a_1 = 52$
The only solution to this equation is $(a_1, a_2) = (2, 9)$, so we have \[k = -18a_3 + 8a_2 - 3a_1 + a_0 = -18 \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot 9 -3 \cdot 2 + a_0 = 30 + a_0.\]Therefore, the possible values of $k$ are $30, 31, 32, \ldots, 39$, which sum to \[30 + 31 + 32 + \dots + 39 = \frac{69 \cdot 10}{2} = 345.\]
Adding up both cases, we get the answer, $145 + 345 = \boxed{490}$.
By the change-of-base formula,
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\log_{15} 2 + 1} + \frac{1}{\log_{10} 3 + 1} + \frac{1}{\log_6 5 + 1} &= \frac{1}{\frac{\log 2}{\log 15} + 1} + \frac{1}{\frac{\log 3}{\log 10} + 1} + \frac{1}{\frac{\log 5}{\log 6} + 1} \\
&= \frac{\log 15}{\log 2 + \log 15} + \frac{\log 10}{\log 3 + \log 10} + \frac{\log 6}{\log 5 + \log 6} \\
&= \frac{\log 15}{\log 30} + \frac{\log 10}{\log 30} + \frac{\log 6}{\log 30} \\
&= \frac{\log 15 + \log 10 + \log 6}{\log 30} \\
&= \frac{\log 900}{\log 30} = \frac{2 \log 30}{\log 30} = \boxed{2}.
\end{align*}
We have the factorization
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc).\]Squaring the equation $a + b + c = 11,$ we get
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 121.\]Then $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc = 121 - 3(ab + ac + bc) = 121 - 75 = 46,$ so
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = 11 \cdot 46 = \boxed{506}.\]
By AM-GM,
\[1 = 16^{x^2 + y} + 16^{x + y^2} \ge 2 \sqrt{16^{x^2 + y} \cdot 16^{x + y^2}} = 2 \cdot 4^{x^2 + y^2 + x + y} = 2^{2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2x + 2y + 1},\]so
\[2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2x + 2y + 1 \le 0.\]Then
\[x^2 + x + y^2 + y + \frac{1}{2} \le 0.\]Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get
\[\left( x + \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( y + \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \le 0.\]The only possible pair is then $(x,y) = \left( -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2} \right).$  Hence, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution.
Let $a = 2^x$ and $b = 3^x.$  Then the given equation becomes
\[\frac{a^3 + b^3}{a^2 b + ab^2} = \frac{7}{6}.\]We can factor, to get
\[\frac{(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)}{ab(a + b)} = \frac{7}{6}.\]Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $a + b$ must be positive, so we can safely cancel the factors of $a + b,$ to get
\[\frac{a^2 - ab + b^2}{ab} = \frac{7}{6}.\]Then $6a^2 - 6ab + 6b^2 = 7ab,$ which simplifies to $6a^2 - 13ab + 6b^2 = 0.$  This equation factors as $(2a - 3b)(3a - 2b) = 0,$ so $2a = 3b$ or $3a = 2b.$
If $2a = 3b,$ then $2^{x + 1} = 3^{x + 1},$ or
\[\frac{2^{x + 1}}{3^{x + 1}} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^{x + 1} = 1.\]The only solution here is $x = -1.$
If $3a = 2b,$ then $3 \cdot 2^x = 2 \cdot 3^x,$ or
\[\frac{3 \cdot 2^x}{2 \cdot 3^x} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^{x - 1} = 1.\]The only solution here is $x = 1.$
Therefore, the solutions are $\boxed{-1,1}.$
The graph of $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ is an ellipse centered at the origin, with semi-axes of length $a$ and $b.$ Because the foci of the ellipse lie along the $y-$axis, the major axis of the ellipse must be the vertical axis
The distance between each focus of the ellipse and the center is $4,$ so we have \[b^2 - a^2 = 4^2 = 16.\]The graph of $\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ is an hyperbola centered at the origin
The distance between each focus of the hyperbola and the center is $6,$ so we have \[a^2 + b^2 = 6^2 = 36.\]Therefore, we have the system of equations \[\begin{aligned} b^2-a^2 &= 16, \\ a^2+b^2 &= 36
\end{aligned}\]To solve this system, we add the two equations, giving $2b^2 = 52,$ so $b^2 = 26,$ and $b = \pm \sqrt{26}.$ Then, $26 - a^2 = 16,$ so $a^2 = 10,$ and $a = \pm \sqrt{10}.$ Thus, \[ab = (\pm \sqrt{10})(\pm \sqrt{26}) = \pm 2 \sqrt{65},\]so $|ab| = \boxed{2 \sqrt{65}}.$[asy]

The integers $n$ that satisfy $10 < n^2 < 99$ are
\[-9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\]for a total of $\boxed{12}$ integers.
We have $\left|\frac12-ci\right| = \sqrt{{\frac12}^2 + (-c)^2} = \sqrt{c^2 + \frac14}$, so $\left|\frac12-ci\right| = \frac34$ gives us $\sqrt{c^2 + \frac14} = \frac34$
Squaring both sides gives $c^2 + \frac14 = \frac9{16}$, so $c^2=\frac5{16}$
Taking the square root of both sides gives $c = \frac{\sqrt5}4$ and $c=-\frac{\sqrt5}4$ as solutions, so there are $\boxed{2}$ real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.
We also could have solved this equation by noting that $\left|\frac12-ci\right| = \frac34$ means that the complex number $\frac12-ci$ is $\frac34$ units from the origin in the complex plane
Therefore, it is on the circle centered at the origin with radius $\frac34$
The complex number $\frac12-ci$ is also on the vertical line that intersects the real axis at $\frac12$, which is inside the aforementioned circle
Since this line goes inside the circle, it must intersect the circle at $\boxed{2}$ points, which correspond to the values of $c$ that satisfy the original equation.
Suppose $a,$ $b,$ $c$ are three consecutive terms of the sequence
Then $b = ac - 1,$ so
\[c = \frac{b + 1}{a}.\]Let $a_n$ denote the $n$th term
Then $a_1 = x,$ $a_2 = 2000,$ and
\begin{align*}
a_3 &= \frac{a_2 + 1}{a_1} = \frac{2001}{x}, \\
a_4 &= \frac{a_3 + 1}{a_2} = \frac{2001/x + 1}{2000} = \frac{x + 2001}{2000x}, \\
a_5 &= \frac{(x + 2001)/(2000x) + 1}{2001/x} = \frac{x + 1}{2000}, \\
a_6 &= \frac{(x + 1)/2000 + 1}{(x + 2001)/(2000x)} = x, \\
a_7 &= \frac{x + 1}{(x + 1)/2000} = 2000.
\end{align*}Since $a_6 = a_1$ and $a_7 = a_2,$ and each term depends only on the previous two terms, the sequence becomes periodic from this point, with period 5
Therefore, the first five terms represent all possible values.
We can have $a_1 = x = 2001.$
We can have $a_3 = \frac{2001}{x} = 2001,$ which leads to
\[x = 1.\]We can have $a_4 = \frac{x + 2001}{2000x} = 2001,$ which leads to
\[x = \frac{2001}{4001999}.\]We can have $a_5 = \frac{x + 1}{2000} = 2001,$ which leads to
\[x = 4001999.\]Thus, there are $\boxed{4}$ different possible values of $x.$
The degree of the polynomial is $1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 12 = \frac{12 \cdot 13}{2} = 78.$
When we expand $(x - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^3 - 3) \dotsm (x^{11} - 11)(x^{12} - 12),$ we choose a term from each factor
For example, from the first factor $x - 1,$ we can choose either $x$ or $-1.$  From the second factor $x^2 - 2,$ we can choose either $x^2$ or $-2,$ and so on
So to find the coefficient of $x^{70},$ we want to cover all possible choices where the powers of $x$ multiply to $x^{70}.$
Since the degree of the polynomial is $x^{78},$ the product of the "missing" powers of $x$ must be $x^8.$  We divide into cases.
Case 1: One factor has a missing power of $x.$
If one factor has a missing power of $x,$ it must be $x^8 - 8,$ where we choose $-8$ instead of $x^8.$  Thus, this case contributes $-8x^{70}.$
Case 2: Two factors have a missing power of $x.$
If there are two missing powers of $x,$ then they must be $x^a$ and $x^b,$ where $a + b = 8.$   The possible pairs $(a,b)$ are $(1,7),$ $(2,6),$ and $(3,5)$ (note that order does not matter), so this case contributes $[(-1)(-7) + (-2)(-6) + (-3)(-5)] x^{70} = 34x^{70}.$
Case 3: Three factors have a missing power of $x.$
If there are three missing powers of $x,$ then they must be $x^a,$ $x^b,$ and $x^c,$ where $a + b + c = 8.$   The only possible triples $(a,b,c)$ are $(1,2,5)$ and $(1,3,4),$ so this case contributes $[(-1)(-2)(-5) + (-1)(-3)(-4)] x^{70} = -22x^{70}.$
Case 4: Four factors or more have a missing power of $x.$
If there are four or more missing powers of $x,$ then they must be $x^a,$ $x^b,$ $x^c,$ and $x^d$ where $a + b + c + d = 8.$  Since $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ are distinct, we must have $a + b + c + d \ge 10.$  Therefore, there are no ways to get a power of $x^{70}$ in this case.
Thus, the coefficient of $x^{70}$ is $(-8) + 34 + (-22) = \boxed{4}.$
By the AM-HM inequality on the numbers $a+b$, $a+c$, and $b+c$, we have
$$\frac{(a+b)+(a+c)+(b+c)}{3} \ge \frac{3}{\frac{1}{a+b}+\frac{1}{a+c}+\frac{1}{b+c}}.$$Cross-multiplying and simplifying gives us
$$\frac{1}{3}(2a+2b+2c)\left(\frac{1}{a+b}+\frac{1}{a+c}+\frac{1}{b+c}\right) \ge 3,$$and hence
$$(a+b+c)\left(\frac{1}{a+b}+\frac{1}{a+c}+\frac{1}{b+c}\right) \ge \boxed{\frac{9}{2}}.$$This value is achieved when $a=b=c=1$.
We realize that $a^3+b^3$ is the sum of two cubes and thus can be expressed as $(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$
From this, we have  \begin{align*}
a^3 + b^3 & = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2) \\
& = (a+b)((a^2+2ab+b^2)-3ab) \\
& = (a+b)((a+b)^2-3ab)
\end{align*}Now, since $a+b=10$ and $ab=17$, we have $$a^3+b^3= (a+b)((a+b)^2-3ab)=10\cdot(10^2-3\cdot17)=10\cdot49=\boxed{490}.$$
In order for the given function to have a real value, $\log_3(\log_4x)>0$ (since the logarithm of only any positive number is real)
In order for the last inequality to be true, $\log_4x>1$ (since the logarithm of only any number greater than 1 is greater than 0)
The last inequality is true only if $x>4^1$, so $x>4$, or $x \in \boxed{(4, \infty)}$ in interval notation.
We can factor the denominator to get $f(x) = \frac{x^2-x+c}{(x-2)(x+3)}$
Hence, the graph of $f(x)$ has vertical asymptotes at $x=2$ and $x=-3$, unless there is a factor of $x-2$ or $x+3$ in the numerator that cancels out the corresponding factor in the denominator (in this case there will be a hole at that point rather than an asymptote).
By the Factor theorem, if $x^2-x+c$ has a factor of $x-2$, we must have $2^2-2+c=0$ which gives us $c=-2$
Similarly, if $x^2-x+c$ has a factor of $x+3$, we must have $3^2+3+c=0$ which gives us $c=-12$
Therefore, in order to have exactly one asymptote, we need $c = \boxed{-2 \text{ or } -12}$.
Since $z^2 + z + 1 = 0,$ $(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) = 0.$  This expands as $z^3 - 1 = 0,$ so $z^3 = 1.$  Therefore,
\[z^{97} = z^{32 \cdot 3 + 1} = (z^3)^{32} z = z.\]Similarly, we can reduce $z^{98},$ $z^{99},$ $z^{100},$ $z^{101},$ to $z^2,$ 1, $z,$ $z^2,$ respectively, so
\begin{align*}
z^{97} + z^{98} + z^{99} + z^{100} + z^{101} &= z + z^2 + 1 + z + z^2 \\
&= (1 + z + z^2) + (1 + z + z^2) - 1 \\
&= \boxed{-1}.
\end{align*}
By AM-HM,
\[\frac{(a + 2b) + (b + 2c) + (c + 2a)}{3} \ge \frac{3}{\frac{1}{a + 2b} + \frac{1}{b + 2c} + \frac{1}{c + 2a}},\]so
\[\frac{1}{a + 2b} + \frac{1}{b + 2c} + \frac{1}{c + 2a} \ge \frac{9}{3a + 3b + 3c} = \frac{9}{3} = 3.\]Equality occurs when $a = b = c = \frac{1}{3},$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{3}.$
The graphs of $y=ax^2+3x+1$ and $y=-x-1$ intersect at exactly one point when the equation
$$ax^2+3x+1=-x-1$$has only one solution
This equation simplifies to $ax^2+4x+2=0$, which has only one solution when the discriminant is $0$, in other words,
$$4^2-4(a)(2)=0.$$Solving for $a$ gives $a=\boxed{2}$.
Let $y = 2x.$  Then $x = \frac{y}{2},$ so
\[\frac{y^3}{8} - \frac{3y^2}{4} + 8 = 0.\]Multiplying by 8, we get $y^3 - 6y^2 + 64 = 0.$  The corresponding polynomial in $x$ is then $\boxed{x^3 - 6x^2 + 64}.$
The line is of the form $y = mx + 5.$  Substituting, we get
\[9x^2 + 16(mx + 5)^2 = 144.\]Expanding, we get
\[(16m^2 + 9) x^2 + 160mx + 256 = 0.\]For the line and ellipse to intersect, this quadratic must have a real root, which means that its discriminant is nonnegative:
\[(160m)^2 - 4(16m^2 + 9)(256) \ge 0.\]This reduces to $m^2 \ge 1.$  Thus, the possible slopes are $m \in \boxed{(-\infty,-1] \cup [1,\infty)}.$
We have that $a = \log_{60} 3$ and $b = \log_{60} 5,$ so
\[1 - a - b = \log_{60} 60 - \log_{60} 3 - \log_{60} 5 = \log_{60} \frac{60}{3 \cdot 5} = \log_{60} 4 = 2 \log_{60} 2\]and
\[2 (1 - b) = 2 (\log_{60} 60 - \log_{60} 5) = 2 \log_{60} 12,\]so
\[\frac{1 - a - b}{2(1 - b)} = \frac{2 \log_{60} 2}{2 \log_{60} 12} = \log_{12} 2.\]Therefore,
\[12^{(1 - a - b)/(2(1 - b))} = \boxed{2}.\]
Since we are dividing by a quadratic, our remainder will have degree at most $1$
Hence the remainder is of the form $ax+b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$
We have
$$P(x) = (x-13)(x-17)Q(x) + ax+b$$where $Q(x)$ is the quotient when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-13)(x-17)$
We can eliminate the $Q(x)$ term by plugging in $x=13$ or $x=17$
Using the Remainder Theorem, each gives us an equation:
$$P(13) = 13a+b=6$$$$P(17) = 17a+b=14$$Solving this system gives us $a=2$ and $b=-20$, and hence the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-13)(x-17)$ is $\boxed{2x-20}$.
Let the three entries be $\binom{n}{r},$ $\binom{n}{r+1},$ and $\binom{n}{r+2},$ respectively
Then we have \[\frac{\binom{n}{r}}{\binom{n}{r+1}} = \frac{3}{4} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\binom{n}{r+1}}{\binom{n}{r+2}} = \frac{4}{5}.\]We simplify the left-hand side of the first equation: \[\frac{\binom{n}{r}}{\binom{n}{r+1}} = \frac{\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}}{\frac{n!}{(r+1)!)(n-r-1)!}} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \cdot \frac{(r+1)!(n-r-1)!}{n!} = \frac{r+1}{n-r}.\]Therefore, $\frac{r+1}{n-r} = \frac{3}{4}.$ Similarly, the second equation becomes $\frac{r+2}{n-r-1} = \frac{4}{5}.$
Cross-multiplying in both equations, we have \[4r+4 = 3n-3r \quad \text{and} \quad 5r+10 = 4n-4r-4.\]Solving for $r$ in the first equation gives $r = \frac{3n-4}{7},$ and then we have \[9\left(\frac{3n-4}{7}\right) + 14 = 4n,\]and solving for $n$ gives $n = \boxed{62}.$
From the given equation,
\begin{align*}
a &= k(1 - b), \\
b &= k(1 - c), \\
c &= k(1 - a).
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
a &= k(1 - b) \\
&= k(1 - k(1 - c)) \\
&= k(1 - k(1 - k(1 - a))).
\end{align*}Expanding, we get $ak^3 + a - k^3 + k^2 - k = 0,$ which factors as
\[(k^2 - k + 1)(ak + a - k) = 0.\]If $ak + a - k = 0,$ then $a = \frac{k}{k + 1},$ in which case $b = c = \frac{k}{k + 1}.$  This is not allowed, as $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are distinct, so $k^2 - k + 1 = 0.$  The sum of the roots is $\boxed{1}.$
Note: The roots of $k^2 - k + 1 = 0$ are
\[\frac{1 \pm i \sqrt{3}}{2}.\]For either value of $k,$ we can take $a = 0,$ $b = 1,$ and $c = k.$
Let $x = b - c,$ $y = c - a,$ and $z = a - b,$ so
\[\frac{a}{x} + \frac{b}{y} + \frac{c}{z} = 0.\]Then
\[\left( \frac{a}{x} + \frac{b}{y} + \frac{c}{z} \right) \left( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} \right) = 0.\]Expanding, we get
\[\frac{a}{x^2} + \frac{b}{y^2} + \frac{c}{z^2} + \frac{a + b}{xy} + \frac{a + c}{xz} + \frac{b + c}{yz} = 0.\]Note that
\begin{align*}
\frac{a + b}{xy} + \frac{a + c}{xz} + \frac{b + c}{yz} &= \frac{(a + b)z + (a + c)y + (b + c)x}{xyz} \\
&= \frac{(a + b)(a - b) + (a + c)(c - a) + (b + c)(b - c)}{xyz} \\
&= \frac{a^2 - b^2 + c^2 - a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{xyz} \\
\end{align*}so
\[\frac{a}{(b - c)^2} + \frac{b}{(c - a)^2} + \frac{c}{(a - b)^2} = \frac{a}{x^2} + \frac{b}{y^2} + \frac{c}{z^2} = \boxed{0}.\]
By QM-AM,
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{\frac{(a - 1)^2 + (\frac{b}{a} - 1)^2 + (\frac{c}{b} - 1)^2 + (\frac{4}{c} - 1)^2}{4}} &\ge \frac{(a - 1) + (\frac{b}{a} - 1) + (\frac{c}{b} - 1) + (\frac{4}{c} - 1)}{4} \\
&= \frac{a + \frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{4}{c} - 4}{4}.
\end{align*}By AM-GM,
\[a + \frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{4}{c} \ge 4 \sqrt[4]{4} = 4 \sqrt{2},\]so
\[\sqrt{\frac{(a - 1)^2 + (\frac{b}{a} - 1)^2 + (\frac{c}{b} - 1)^2 + (\frac{4}{c} - 1)^2}{4}} \ge \sqrt{2} - 1,\]and
\[(a - 1)^2 + \left( \frac{b}{a} - 1 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{c}{b} - 1 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{4}{c} - 1 \right)^2 \ge 4 (\sqrt{2} - 1)^2 = 12 - 8 \sqrt{2}.\]Equality occurs when $a = \sqrt{2},$ $b = 2,$ and $c = 2 \sqrt{2},$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{12 - 8 \sqrt{2}}.$
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(1 + 1 + 1)(3x + 1 + 3y + 3 + 3z + 5) \ge (\sqrt{3x + 1} + \sqrt{3y + 3} + \sqrt{3z + 5})^2.\]Then
\[(\sqrt{3x + 1} + \sqrt{3y + 3} + \sqrt{3z + 5})^2 \le (3)(3 + 1 + 3 + 5) = 36,\]so $\sqrt{3x + 1} + \sqrt{3y + 3} + \sqrt{3z + 5} \le 6.$
Equality occurs when $3x + 1 = 3y + 3 = 3z + 5.$  Along with the condition $x + y + z = 1,$ we can solve to get $x = 1,$ $y = \frac{1}{3},$ $z = -\frac{1}{3}.$  Thus, the maximum value is $\boxed{6}.$
By Vieta's formulas, $a+b+c=\tfrac{3}{2},$ so $a+b-1 = \left(\tfrac{3}{2}-c\right)-1=\tfrac{1}{2}-c.$ Writing similar equations for the other two terms, we get \[(a+b-1)^3 + (b+c-1)^3 + (c+a-1)^3 = \left(\tfrac{1}{2}-a\right)^3 +\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-b\right)^3 +\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-c\right)^3.\]Now, note that $\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-a\right) +\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-b\right) +\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-c\right) = \tfrac{3}{2} - (a+b+c) = 0.$ It's a general fact that if $r+s+t=0,$ then $r^3+s^3+t^3=3rst$; this follows from the factorization identity \[r^3 + s^3 + t^3 = 3 rst + (r+s+t)(r^2+s^2+t^2-rs-st-rt).\]Therefore, \[ \left(\tfrac{1}{2}-a\right)^3 +\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-b\right)^3 +\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-c\right)^3 = 3\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-a\right)\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-b\right)\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-c\right).\]Finally, letting $p(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 165x - 4,$ we have $p(x) = 2(x-a)(x-b)(x-c),$ so \[78 = p(\tfrac{1}{2}) = 2\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-a\right)\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-b\right)\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-c\right).\]Therefore the answer is \[3\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-a\right)\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-b\right)\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-c\right) = \tfrac{3}{2} \cdot 78 = \boxed{117}.\]
Let $a = -1 - 3i$ and $b = 7 + 8i.$  Then $z$ lies on the circle centered at $a$ with radius 1, and $w$ lies on the circle centered at $b$ with radius 3.

By the Triangle Inequality,
\[|a - z| + |z - w| + |w - b| \ge |a - b|,\]so
\[|z - w| \ge |a - b| - |a - z| - |w - b|.\]We have that $|a - b| = |(-1 - 3i) - (7 + 8i) = |-8 - 11i| = \sqrt{185}.$  Also, $|a - z| = 1$ and $|w - b| = 3,$ so
\[|z - w| \ge \sqrt{185} - 4.\]Equality occurs when $z$ and $w$ are the intersections of the circles with the line segments connecting $a$ and $b.$

Let's begin by ignoring the condition that $x<y$
Instead, suppose $x,y$ are any two (not necessarily distinct) numbers between $1$ and $100$, inclusive
We want $i^x + i^y$ to be real.
Any pair of even numbers will work, as both $i^x$ and $i^y$ will be real; there are $50 \cdot 50 = 2500$ such pairs
Note that among these pairs, exactly $50$ of them satisfy $x = y$.
We have two other possibilities; (a) $i^x = i$ and $i^y = -i$, or (b) $i^x = -i$ and $i^y = i$
Note that there are $25$ numbers $n$ for which $i^n = i$ (namely, $n = 1, 4, \ldots, 97$), and there are $25$ numbers $n$ for which $i^n = -i$ (namely $n = 3, 7, \ldots, 99$)
Therefore, there are $25 \cdot 25 = 625$ desirable pairs in case (a), and similarly, there are $625$ desirable pairs in case (b), resulting in an additional $625 + 625 = 1250$ pairs
Note that none of these pairs satisfy $x = y$.
Therefore, there are a total of $2500+1250 = 3750$ pairs $(x,y)$ with $1 \leq x,y \leq 100$ such that $i^x + i^y$ is a real number
Now, let's try to determine how many of these satisfy $x < y$
First of all, let's remove the $50$ pairs with $x = y$, leaving us with $3700$ pairs
Among these $3700$ pairs, we know that exactly half of them satisfy $x < y$ and the other half satisfy $x > y$ by symmetry
Therefore, the answer is $3700 / 2 = \boxed{1850}$.
Let $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.$  Then from the given information,
\begin{align*}
4a - 2b + c &= 13, \\
a + b + c &= -2, \\
9a + 3b + c &= 8.
\end{align*}Subtracting the first and second equations, and second and third equations, we get
\begin{align*}
-3a + 3b &= -15, \\
8a + 2b &= 10.
\end{align*}Then $-a + b = -5$ and $4a + b = 5.$  We can quickly solve, to find $a = 2$ and $b = -3.$  Substituting into the equation $a + b + c = -2,$ we get $2 - 3 + c = -2,$ so $c = -1.$  Therefore, $p(x) = \boxed{2x^2 - 3x - 1}.$
We must have \[\lfloor x \rfloor - \{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor,\]or, simplifying the right-hand side, \[\lfloor x \rfloor - \{x\} = \{x\}.\]Thus, \[\lfloor x \rfloor = 2\{x\}.\]Since the left-hand side is an integer, $2\{x\}$ must be an integer
We know that $0 \le \{x\} < 1,$ so either $\{x\} = 0$ or $\{x\} = \tfrac12.$ If $\{x\} = 0,$ then $\lfloor x \rfloor = 2 \cdot 0 = 0,$ so $x = 0,$ which is impossible because we are given that $x$ is nonzero
So we must have $\{x\} = \tfrac12,$ so $\lfloor x \rfloor = 2 \cdot \tfrac12 = 1,$ and $x = 1 + \tfrac12 = \boxed{\tfrac32}.$
Let $(x,y)$ be a point on the parabola
The distance from $(x,y)$ to the focus is
\[\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 3)^2}.\]The distance from $(x,y)$ to the line $3x + 7y - 21 = 0$ is
\[\frac{|3x + 7y - 21|}{\sqrt{3^2 + 7^2}} = \frac{|3x + 7y - 21|}{\sqrt{58}}.\]By definition of the parabola, these distances are equal
Hence,
\[\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = \frac{|3x + 7y - 21|}{\sqrt{58}}.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[(x - 3)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = \frac{(3x + 7y - 21)^2}{58}.\]This simplifies to $\boxed{49x^2 - 42xy + 9y^2 - 222x - 54y + 603 = 0}.$
For radius $r$ and height $h,$ the volume is given by $\pi r^2 h = V,$ and the total surface area is given by
\[A = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi rh.\]By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
A &= 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi rh \\
&= 2 \pi r^2 + \pi rh + \pi rh \\
&\ge 3 \sqrt[3]{(2 \pi r^2)(\pi rh)(\pi rh)} \\
&= 3 \sqrt[3]{2 \pi^3 r^4 h^2}.
\end{align*}Since $\pi r^2 h = V,$ $r^2 h = \frac{V}{\pi}.$  Then
\[3 \sqrt[3]{2 \pi^3 r^4 h^2} = 3 \sqrt[3]{2 \pi^3 \cdot \frac{V^2}{\pi^2}} = 3 \sqrt[3]{2 \pi V^2}.\]Equality occurs when $2 \pi r^2 = \pi rh,$ so $\frac{h}{r} = \boxed{2}.$
From the given equation,
\[\sqrt{1 + x} + \sqrt{1 - x} = \frac{7 \sqrt{2}}{5}.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[1 + x + 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 1 - x = \frac{98}{25},\]which simplifies to
\[2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{48}{25}.\]Dividing both sides by 2, we get
\[\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{24}{25}.\]Squaring both sides again, we get
\[1 - x^2 = \frac{576}{625},\]so
\[x^2 = \frac{49}{625}.\]The positive value of $x$ is then $\boxed{\frac{7}{25}}.$
By Vieta's formulas, $ab + ac + bc = \boxed{\frac{11}{3}}.$

\end{array}
\]In the last step of the division, we have $39$ left as the constant term in our dividend and we need a remainder of $4$ at the end
Since our divisor has a term of $7$, the only way to do this is if our quotient has $5$ which gives us  $7\cdot5=35$ to subtract from our dividend and get the right remainder.
Then, we need the rest of our remainder to be $0$
This means
$$\frac{7c-27+20}{2} = 0$$which gives us
$$c = \boxed{1}.$$
From the given equation, $5(a - b)(c - d) = 2(b - c)(d - a),$ which expands as
\[5ac - 5ad - 5bc + 5bd = 2bd - 2ab - 2cd + 2ac.\]This simplifies to $2ab + 3ac + 3bd + 2cd = 5ad + 5bc,$ so
\[ad + bc = \frac{2ab + 3ac + 3bd + 2cd}{5}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\frac{(a - c)(b - d)}{(a - b)(c - d)} &= \frac{ab - ad - bc + cd}{ac - ad - bc + bd} \\
&= \frac{ab + cd - \frac{2ab + 3ac + 3bd + 2cd}{5}}{ac + bd - \frac{2ab + 3ac + 3bd + 2cd}{5}} \\
&= \frac{5ab + 5cd - 2ab - 3ac - 3bd - 2cd}{5ac + 5bd - 2ab - 3ac - 3bd - 2cd} \\
&= \frac{3ab - 3ac - 3bd + 3cd}{-2ab + 2ac + 2bd - 2cd} \\
&= \frac{3(ab - ac - bd + cd)}{-2(ab - ac - bd + cd)} \\
&= \boxed{-\frac{3}{2}}.
\end{align*}
Since $x$ and $y$ are nonnegative, $x = a^2$ and $y = b^2$ for some nonnegative real numbers $a$ and $b.$  Then
\[ab + c |a^2 - b^2| \ge \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}.\]If $a = b,$ then both sides reduce to $a^2,$ and so the inequality holds
Otherwise, without loss of generality, we can assume that $a < b.$  Then the inequality above becomes
\[ab + c(b^2 - a^2) \ge \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}.\]Then
\[c (b^2 - a^2) \ge \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} - ab = \frac{a^2 - 2ab + b^2}{2} = \frac{(b - a)^2}{2},\]so
\[c \ge \frac{(b - a)^2}{2(b^2 - a^2)} = \frac{b - a}{2(b + a)}.\]We want this inequality to hold for all nonnegative real numbers $a$ and $b$ where $a < b.$
Note that
\[\frac{b - a}{2(b + a)} < \frac{b + a}{2(b + a)} = \frac{1}{2}.\]Furthermore, by letting $a$ approach 0, we can make $\frac{b + a}{2(b - a)}$ arbitrarily close to $\frac{1}{2}.$  Hence, the smallest such real number $c$ is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
The ellipse must have its center at the point $(4, 1).$ Because $(4,1)$ is further from $(0,1)$ than it is from $(4,0),$ the major axis must lie parallel to the $x$-axis and have length $2 \cdot 4 = 8,$ and so the minor axis lies parallel to the $y$-axis and has length $2 \cdot 1 = 2.$ Therefore, the distance between the foci of the ellipse is $\sqrt{8^2 - 2^2} = \boxed{2\sqrt{15}}.$

From the given equation,
\[x^2 + \left( \frac{2x}{x - 2} \right)^2 - 45 = 0.\]Let $a = x$ and $b = \frac{2x}{x - 2}.$  Then $a^2 + b^2 = 45,$ or
\[(a + b)^2 - 2ab - 45 = 0.\]In other words,
\[\left( x + \frac{2x}{x - 2} \right)^2 - \frac{4x^2}{x - 2} - 45 = 0.\]We can write this as
\[\left( \frac{x^2}{x - 2} \right)^2 - \frac{4x^2}{x - 2} - 45 = 0.\]Let $y = \frac{x^2}{x - 2}.$  Then $y^2 - 4y - 45 = 0,$ which factors as $(y - 9)(y + 5) = 0.$  So,
\[\left( \frac{x^2}{x - 2} - 9 \right) \left( \frac{x^2}{x - 2} + 5 \right) = 0.\]Then $(x^2 - 9x + 18)(x^2 + 5x - 10) = 0,$ which factors as
\[(x - 3)(x - 6)(x^2 + 5x - 10) = 0.\]If $x = 3,$ then
\[\frac{(x - 2)^2 (x + 3)}{2x - 3} = 2.\]If $x = 6,$ then
\[\frac{(x - 2)^2 (x + 3)}{2x - 3} = 16.\]If $x^2 + 5x - 10 = 0,$ then $x^2 = -5x + 10,$ and
\[x^3 = x(-5x + 10) = -5x^2 + 10x = -5(-5x + 10) + 10x = 35x - 50.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^3 - x^2 - 8x + 12}{2x - 3} &= \frac{(35x - 50) - (-5x + 10) - 8x + 12}{2x - 3} \\
&= \frac{32x - 48}{2x - 3} = 16.
\end{align*}Thus, the possible values of $\frac{(x - 2)^2 (x + 3)}{2x - 3}$ are $\boxed{2,16}.$
We can factor $x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x + 1)(x + 2)$ and $x^2 + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4).$  Then the given polynomial is
\begin{align*}
(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)(x + 4) + (x^2 + 5x - 6) &= (x + 1)(x + 4)(x + 2)(x + 3) + (x^2 + 5x - 6) \\
&= (x^2 + 5x + 4)(x^2 + 5x + 6) + (x^2 + 5x - 6).
\end{align*}Let $y = x^2 + 5x.$  Then
\begin{align*}
(x^2 + 5x + 4)(x^2 + 5x + 6) + (x^2 + 5x - 6) &= (y + 4)(y + 6) + (y - 6) \\
&= y^2 + 10y + 24 + y - 6 \\
&= y^2  + 11y + 18 \\
&= (y + 2)(y + 9) \\
&= \boxed{(x^2 + 5x + 2)(x^2 + 5x + 9)}.
\end{align*}
We can arrange the equation as
\[9x^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = (x + 1)^3.\]Taking the cube root of both sides, we get
\[x \sqrt[3]{9} = x + 1.\]Then $(\sqrt[3]{9} - 1)x = 1$, so
\[x = \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{9} - 1}.\]To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt[3]{9^2} + \sqrt[3]{9} + 1.$  This gives us
\[\frac{\sqrt[3]{9^2} + \sqrt[3]{9} + 1}{(\sqrt[3]{9} - 1)(\sqrt[3]{9^2} + \sqrt[3]{9} + 1)} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{81} + \sqrt[3]{9} + 1}{8}.\]Then $a + b + c = 81 + 9 + 8 = \boxed{98}.$
An example of a quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ is $(x-2)(x-4)$
However, when $x=3$, this function takes the value $-1$
However, multiplying the entire quadratic by $-6$ does not change the location of the zeroes, and does give us the desired value at $x=3$.
Thus, $-6(x-2)(x-4)$ has all the desired properties
The expanded form of this expression is $\boxed{-6x^2+36x-48}$.
Note that this is the only such quadratic
Any quadratic must factor as $a(x-r)(x-s)$, where its zeroes are $r$ and $s$; thus a quadratic with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ must be of the form $a(x-2)(x-4)$, and the coefficient $a=-6$ is forced by the value at $x=3$.
From $f(1) = 0,$ $a + b + c = 0,$ so $c = -a - b.$  Then
\[f(7) = 49a + 7b + c = 48a + 6b = 6(8a + b),\]so from $50 < f(7) < 60,$
\[50 < 6(8a + b) < 60.\]The only multiple of 6 in this range is 54, leading to $8a + b = 9.$
\[f(8) = 64a + 8b + c = 63a + 7b = 7(9a + b),\]so from $70 < f(8) < 80,$
\[70 < 7(9a + b) < 80.\]The only multiple of 7 in this range is 77, leading to $9a + b = 11.$  Then $a = 2,$ $b = -7,$ and $c = 5.$
Hence, $f(100) = 2 \cdot 100^2 - 7 \cdot 100 + 5 = 19305,$ so $k = \boxed{3}.$
We know that the point $(a,b)$ lies on an asymptote, as shown below.

Since the angle between the asymptotes is $60^\circ,$ $a$ is the long leg of a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle, and $b$ is the short leg
Thus, $\frac{a}{b} = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}.$
We have that $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{1} = 2,$ $\frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{16}{1} = 2,$ and so on
Thus, the ten fractions can be grouped into five pairs, where the product of the fractions in each pair is 2
Therefore, the product of all ten fractions is $2^5 = \boxed{32}.$
Setting $x = 2,$ we get
\[f(2) + f \left( -\frac{3}{5} \right) = 2.\]Setting $x = -\frac{3}{5},$ we get
\[f \left( -\frac{3}{5} \right) + f \left( \frac{1}{7} \right) = -\frac{3}{5}.\]Setting $x = \frac{1}{7},$ we get
\[f \left( \frac{1}{7} \right) + f(2) = \frac{1}{7}.\]Adding the first and third equations, we get
\[2f(2) + f \left( -\frac{3}{5} \right) + f \left( \frac{1}{7} \right) = \frac{15}{7}.\]Then $2f(2) - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{15}{7},$ which means $2f(2) = \frac{96}{35},$ so $f(2) = \boxed{\frac{48}{35}}.$
Pair every two terms starting from the first
We see that the sum of each pair is $-3$
There are $(49+5)/6=9$ pairs, so the sum of all the pairs is $-3\cdot9=-27$
Add that to the last number in the series and the value of the entire expression is $-27+55=\boxed{28}$.
We have that $z^3 - 1 = 0,$ which factors as $(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) = 0.$  Since $\omega$ is not real, $\omega$ satisfies
\[\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0.\]By the quadratic formula,
\[\omega = \frac{-1 \pm i \sqrt{3}}{2}.\]Let $\omega = \frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2}.$  Then $|a \omega + b|^2 = 1.$  Also,
\begin{align*}
|a \omega + b|^2 &= \left| a \cdot \frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2} + b \right|^2 \\
&= \left| -\frac{1}{2} a + b + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} ai \right|^2 \\
&= \left( -\frac{1}{2} a + b \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a \right)^2 \\
&= \frac{1}{4} a^2 - ab + b^2 + \frac{3}{4} a^2 \\
&= a^2 - ab + b^2.
\end{align*}Thus, we want to find integers $a$ and $b$ so that $a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1.$  Note that we derived this equation from the equation
\[\left( -\frac{1}{2} a + b \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a \right)^2 = 1.\]Then
\[\left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a \right)^2 \le 1,\]so
\[\left| \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a \right| \le 1.\]Then
\[|a| \le \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} < 2,\]so the only possible values of $a$ are $-1,$ $0,$ and $1.$
If $a = -1,$ then the equation $a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1$ becomes
\[b^2 + b = 0.\]The solutions are $b = -1$ and $b = 0.$
If $a = 0,$ then the equation $a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1$ becomes
\[b^2 = 1.\]The solutions are $b = -1$ and $b = 1.$
If $a = 1,$ then the equation $a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1$ becomes
\[b^2 - b = 0.\]The solutions are $b = 0$ and $b = 1.$
Therefore, the possible pairs $(a,b)$ are $(-1,-1),$ $(-1,0),$ $(0,-1),$ $(0,1),$ $(1,0),$ and $(1,1).$
We went with the value $\omega = \frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2}.$  The other possible value of $\omega$ is
\[\frac{-1 - i \sqrt{3}}{2} = 1 - \omega,\]so any number that can be represented in the form $a \omega + b$ can also be represented in this form with the other value of $\omega.$  (In other words, it doesn't which value of $\omega$ we use.)
Hence, there are $\boxed{6}$ possible pairs $(a,b).$
Note that the complex numbers of the form $a \omega + b$ form a triangular lattice in the complex plane
This makes it clear why there are six complex numbers that have absolute value 1.

We try to rewrite the given equation in the standard form for an ellipse
Completing the square in both variables, we have \[\begin{aligned} 2(x^2+4x) + (y^2-10y) + c &= 0 \\ 2(x^2+4x+4) + (y^2-10y+25) + c &= 33 \\ 2(x+2)^2 + (y-5)^2 &= 33-c
\end{aligned}\]To get this equation in standard form, we would normally try to divide by $33-c,$ and if $33-c>0,$ then we get the standard form of a (non-degenerate) ellipse
But we cannot do so if $33-c=0.$ Indeed, if $33-c=0,$ then only one point $(x,y)$ satisfies the equation, because both $x+2$ and $y+5$ must be zero for the left-hand side to equal zero
(And if $33-c < 0$, then no points satisfy the equation, because the right-hand side is always nonnegative.) Thus, the value of $c$ that makes a degenerate ellipse satisfies $33-c=0,$ so $c=\boxed{33}.$
Since $w^4$ and 16 are both perfect squares, we can use our difference of squares factorization: \[w^4-16=(w^2)^2 - 4^2 = (w^2-4)(w^2+4)\]
We're not finished!  The expression $w^2 - 4$ is also a difference of squares, which we can factor as $w^2 - 4=(w-2)(w+2)$
So, we have \[w^4-16 = (w^2-4)(w^2+4) = \boxed{(w-2)(w+2)(w^2+4)}\].
Take cases on the value of $\lfloor x \rfloor$:
If $\lfloor x\rfloor < 0,$ then $x^{\lfloor x \rfloor}$ can never be an integer.
If $\lfloor x \rfloor = 0$ (and $x \neq 0$), then $x^{\lfloor x \rfloor} = x^0 = 1$ regardless of the value of $x.$ Thus $N = 1$ ($1$ value).
If $\lfloor x \rfloor = 1,$ then $1 \le x < 2,$ and $x^{\lfloor x\rfloor} = x^1 = x,$ so we still only have $N = 1$.
If $\lfloor x \rfloor = 2,$ then $2 \le x < 3,$ and $x^{\lfloor x\rfloor} = x^2,$ so we get $N = 4, 5, \ldots, 8$ ($5$ values).
If $\lfloor x\rfloor = 3,$ then $3 \le x < 4,$ and $x^{\lfloor x \rfloor} = x^3,$ so we get $N = 27, 28, \ldots, 63$ ($37$ values).
If $\lfloor x\rfloor = 4,$ then $4 \le x < 5,$ and $x^{\lfloor x\rfloor} = x^4,$ so we get $N = 256, 257, \ldots, 624$ ($369$ values).
If $\lfloor x\rfloor \ge 5,$ then $x^{\lfloor x\rfloor} \ge 5^5 = 3125 > 1000,$ which is too large.
Therefore, the number of possible values for $N$ is $1 + 5 + 37 + 369 = \boxed{412}.$
When computing $N$, the number $2^x$ will be added $x$ times (for terms $2^x-2^0$, $2^x-2^1$, $\dots,$ $2^x - 2^{x-1}$), and subtracted $10-x$ times
Hence, $N$ can be computed as $$N=10\cdot 2^{10} + 8\cdot 2^9 + 6\cdot 2^8 + \cdots - 8\cdot 2^1 - 10\cdot 2^0.$$Then
\begin{align*}
N & = 10(2^{10}-1) + 8(2^9 - 2^1) + 6(2^8-2^2) + 4(2^7-2^3) + 2(2^6-2^4) \\
& = 10(1023) + 8(510) + 6(252) + 4(120) + 2(48) \\
& = 10(1000+23) + 8(500+10) + 6(250+2) + 480 + 96 \\
&= \boxed{16398}.
\end{align*}
Let $k = \frac{m}{n}$ in reduced form, where $m$ and $n$ are integers
Then by the Rational Root Theorem, $m$ divides 12 and $m$ divides 75, so $m$ must divide $\gcd(12,75) = 3.$  Similarly, $n$ divides 75 and $n$ divides 12, so $n$ must divide $\gcd(75,12) = 3.$  Thus, $m,$ $n \in \{-3, -1, 1, 3\}.$
We are told that $k = \frac{m}{n}$ is not an integer, and negative
The only possibility is that $k =\boxed{-\frac{1}{3}}.$
If $n$ is less than $3$, then $n+8$ is positive, $n-3$ is negative, and $n-12$ is negative
Therefore, the product on the left-hand side of the inequality is positive, so the inequality is not satisfied
If $n$ is strictly between 3 and 12, then $n+8$ is positive, $n-3$ is positive, and $n-12$ is negative
In this case, the product on the left-hand side is negative, so the inequality is satisfied
If $n$ is greater than 12, then $n+8$ is positive, $n-3$ is positive, and $n-12$ is positive
Again, the product is positive so the inequality is not satisfied
If $n=3$ or $n=12$, then the left-hand side is 0, so the inequality is not satisfied
Therefore, the only solutions of the inequality are the $12-3-1=\boxed{8}$ integers strictly between 3 and 12.
By symmetry, the line $x = 100$ must be equidistant to both vertices of the parabolas

Therefore,
\[\frac{-\frac{a}{2} - \frac{c}{2}}{2} = 100,\]which implies $a + c = \boxed{-400}.$
By Vieta's formulas, $a, b, c$ are the roots of the polynomial \[x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 3 = 0.\]Adding $2$ to both sides, we can factor this equation as \[(x-1)^3 = 2.\]For the real value $x = a$, we have $a - 1 = \sqrt[3]{2}$, so $a = \boxed{1 + \sqrt[3]{2}}$.
Because $(x-4)^2$ is always nonnegative, we can safety multiply both sides of the inequality by $(x-4)^2$ without changing the direction of the inequality, with the caveat that we cannot have $x = 4$: \[\begin{aligned} x(x+1) &\ge 12(x-4)^2 \\ 0 &\ge 11x^2 - 97x + 192
\end{aligned}\]This quadratic factors as \[0 \ge (x-3)(11x-64),\]which holds if and only if $3 \le x \le \frac{64}{11}.$ However, since $x \neq 4,$ the solutions to the original inequality are given by \[x \in \boxed{[3, 4) \cup \left(4, \frac{64}{11}\right]}\,.\]
\[f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n - 1} x^{n - 1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0.\]Then from the given information,
\begin{align*}
a_n \cdot 6^n + a_{n - 1} \cdot 6^{n - 1} + \dots + a_1 \cdot 6 + a_0 &= 24, \\
a_n \cdot 24^n + a_{n - 1} \cdot 24^{n - 1} + \dots + a_1 \cdot 24 + a_0 &= 1536.
\end{align*}Then by Cauchy-Schwarz,
\begin{align*}
&(a_n \cdot 6^n + a_{n - 1} \cdot 6^{n - 1} + \dots + a_1 \cdot 6 + a_0)(a_n \cdot 24^n + a_{n - 1} \cdot 24^{n - 1} + \dots + a_1 \cdot 24 + a_0) \\
&\ge (a_n \cdot 12^n + a_{n - 1} \cdot 12^{n - 1} + \dots + a_1 \cdot 12 + a_0)^2.
\end{align*}In other words, $[f(12)]^2 \le 24 \cdot 1536 = 36864,$ so $f(12) \le 192.$
Equality occurs for $f(x) = \frac{x^3}{9},$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{192}.$
Rearranging $y = 2x + c$ gives $2x = y - c.$  Substituting into $y^2 = 8x,$ we get
\[y^2 = 4(y - c) = 4y - 4c,\]or $y^2 - 4y + 4c = 0.$  Since we have a tangent, this quadratic will have a double root
In other words, its discriminant will be 0
Hence, $(-4)^2 - 4(4c) = 16 - 16c = 0,$ which means $c = \boxed{1}.$
By AM-GM,
\[\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a} \ge 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{c} \cdot \frac{c}{a}} = 3.\]Equality occurs when $a = b = c,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{3}.$
Let $x = \alpha + \beta$ and $y = i (\alpha - 2 \beta).$  Then $\alpha - 2 \beta = \frac{y}{i} = -yi.$  Solving for $\alpha$ and $\beta,$ we get
\begin{align*}
\alpha &= \frac{2}{3} x - \frac{y}{3} i, \\
\beta &= \frac{1}{3} x + \frac{y}{3} i.
\end{align*}Since $x$ and $y$ are real, and $\beta = 3 + 2i,$ $x = 9$ and $y = 6.$  Then $\alpha = \boxed{6 - 2i}.$
We start by constructing a quadratic polynomial with $\sqrt{2} +\sqrt{3}$ and $\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3}$ as roots
The sum of the roots is $\sqrt{2} +\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{2} -\sqrt{3}=2\sqrt{2}.$ The product of the roots is $(\sqrt{2} +\sqrt{3})(\sqrt{2} -\sqrt{3})=2-3=-1.$ Thus a quadratic with the roots $\sqrt{2} +\sqrt{3}$ and $\sqrt{2} -\sqrt{3}$ is $$x^2-2\sqrt{2}x-1.$$Next, we want to get rid of the irrational coefficients
We can write $x^2-2\sqrt{2}x-1$ as $x^2-1-2\sqrt{2}x$
Then, multiplying by $x^2-1+2\sqrt{2}x$ gives us
$$(x^2-1-2\sqrt{2}x)(x^2-1+2\sqrt{2}x)=(x^2-1)^2-(2\sqrt{2}x)^2=\boxed{x^4-10x^2+1}$$which is a monic polynomial of degree $4$ with rational coefficients that has $\sqrt{2} +\sqrt{3}$ as a root.
Let $y = \sqrt[3]{1 + \sqrt{x}}.$  Then $y^3 = 1 + \sqrt{x},$ so we can write the given equation as
\[\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{y^3 + 1}} = y.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[1 + \sqrt{y^3 + 1} = y^2,\]so $\sqrt{y^3 + 1} = y^2 - 1.$  Squaring both sides, we get
\[y^3 + 1 = y^4 - 2y^2 + 1,\]which simplifies to $y^4 - y^3 - 2y^2 = 0.$  This factors as $y^2 (y - 2)(y + 1) = 0.$  Since $y = \sqrt[3]{1 + \sqrt{x}}$ has to be at least one, $y = 2.$  Then
\[\sqrt[3]{1 + \sqrt{x}} = 2,\]so $1 + \sqrt{x} = 8.$  Then $\sqrt{x} = 7,$ so $x = \boxed{49}.$
Let $y = 3^x.$  Then
\[9^x - 3^x + 1 = y^2 - y + 1 = \left( y - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{3}{4}.\]Thus, the minimum value is $\boxed{\frac{3}{4}},$ which occurs when $y = \frac{1}{2},$ or $x = \log_3 \frac{1}{2}.$
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of $2x^3 + x^2 - 8x + 20 = 0$ is $-\tfrac{1}{2}.$ Similarly, the sum of the roots of $5x^3-25x^2+19=0$ is $-\tfrac{-25}{5} = 5.$ Notice that the roots of the given equation consist of the roots of both equations put together (since, in general, $ab = 0$ if and only if $a=0$ or $b=0$)
Therefore, the sum of the roots of the given equation is $-\tfrac{1}{2} + 5 = \boxed{\tfrac{9}{2}}.$
Let $x$ and $y$ be the dimensions of the rectangle
Then $2x + 2y = 48,$ so $x + y = 24.$  By AM-GM,
\[24 = x + y \ge 2 \sqrt{xy},\]so $\sqrt{xy} \le 12,$ which means $xy \le 144.$
Equality occurs when $x = y = 12,$ so the largest possible area of the rectangle is $\boxed{144}.$
Adding the given equations gives $2(ab+bc+ca) = 484$, so $ab+bc+ca = 242$
Subtracting from this each of the given equations yields $bc=90$, $ca=80$, and $ab=72$
It follows that $a^2b^2c^2 = 90 \cdot 80 \cdot 72 = 720^2$
Since $abc>0$, we have $abc =\boxed{720}$.
Let the labels be $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d,$ $e,$, $f$ be the labels of the cube, so that $a$ and $b$ are opposite, $c$ and $d$ are opposite, and $e$ and $f$ are opposite
Then the sum of the eight products is
\[ace + acf + ade + adf + bce + bcf + bde + bdf = (a + b)(c + d)(e + f).\]By AM-GM,
\[(a + b)(c + d)(e + f) \le \left[ \frac{(a + b) + (c + d) + (e + f)}{3} \right]^3 = \left( \frac{27}{3} \right)^3 = 729.\]Equality occurs when $a + b = c + d = e + f = 9,$ which is clearly achievable, so the maximum sum is $\boxed{729}.$
We can factor $ab + bc + cd + da$ as $(a + c)(b + d).$  Then by AM-GM,
\[(a + c)(b + d) \le \frac{[(a + c) + (b + d)]^2}{4} = \frac{10^2}{4} = 25.\]Equality occurs when $a = 1,$ $b = 2,$ $c = 4,$ and $d = 3,$ so the largest possible value is $\boxed{25}.$
We can take out a factor of $i^{14762}$ to get
\[i^{14762} + i^{14763} + i^{14764} + i^{14765} = i^{14762} (1 + i + i^2 + i^3).\]Since $i^2 = -1$ and $i^3 = -i,$
\[1 + i + i^2 + i^3 = 1 + i - 1 - i = 0.\]Therefore, the expression is equal to $\boxed{0}.$
The given equation does not resemble the standard form for a hyperbola, so instead, we appeal to the geometric definition of a hyperbola
Notice that the first term on the left-hand side gives the distance between the points $P = (x, y)$ and $A = (1, -2)$ in the coordinate plane
Similarly, the second term on the left-hand side gives the distance between the points $P$ and $B=(5,-2).$ Therefore, the graph of the given equation consists of all points $P=(x,y)$ such that \[PA - PB = 3.\]Thus, by the definition of a hyperbola, the given graph consists of one branch of a hyperbola with foci $A$ and $B.$
The distance between the foci is $AB = 4,$ so the distance between each focus and the center is $c = \frac12 \cdot 4 = 2.$ Furthermore, if $a$  is the distance between each vertex and the center of the hyperbola, then we know that $2a = 3$ (since the general form of a hyperbola is $PF_1 - PF_2 = 2a$), so $a = \frac32.$ Then we have \[b = \sqrt{c^2-a^2} = \frac{\sqrt7}{2}.\]The foci $A$ and $B$ lie along a horizontal axis, so the slopes of the asymptotes are $\pm \frac{b}{a} = \pm \frac{\sqrt7}{3}.$ The answer is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt7}{3}}.$[asy]

Let the terms of the sequence be $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3,$ $\dots.$  Then
\begin{align*}
a_1 &= 1000, \\
a_2 &= x, \\
a_3 &= 1000 - x, \\
a_4 &= 2x - 1000, \\
a_5 &= 2000 - 3x, \\
a_6 &= 5x - 3000, \\
a_7 &= 5000 - 8x, \\
a_8 &= 13x - 8000, \\
a_9 &= 13000 - 21x, \\
a_{10} &= 34x - 21000, \\
a_{11} &= 34000 - 55x.
\end{align*}If the sequence reaches 12 terms, then we must have $34000 - 55x > 0$ and $34x - 21000 > 0,$ or
\[\frac{21000}{34} < x < \frac{34000}{55}.\]The only integer in this interval is $\boxed{618}.$
The left inequality becomes $5x - 1 < x^2 + 2x + 1,$ or
\[x^2 - 3x + 2 > 0.\]This factors as $(x - 1)(x - 2) > 0,$ and the solution to $x \in (-\infty,1) \cup (2,\infty).$
The right inequality becomes $x^2 + 2x + 1 < 7x - 3,$ or
\[x^2 - 5x + 4 < 0.\]This factors as $(x - 1)(x - 4) < 0,$ and the solution is $x \in (1,4).$
The intersection of $(-\infty,1) \cup (2,\infty)$ and $(1,4)$ is $\boxed{(2,4)}.$
Multiplying both sides by $x+3,$ we have $-x^2(x+3) = 3x+1,$ or $-x^3 - 3x^2 = 3x + 1.$ Thus, \[x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0.\]We recognize the left-hand side as the expansion of $(x+1)^3,$ so \[(x+1)^3 = 0.\]This forces $x+1=0,$ so $x = \boxed{-1},$ which is the only solution.
\[y = \sqrt[3]{x \sqrt[3]{x \sqrt[3]{x \dotsm}}}.\]Then
\[y^3 = x \sqrt[3]{x \sqrt[3]{x \dotsm}} = xy,\]so $y^2 = x.$
\[z = \sqrt[3]{x + \sqrt[3]{x + \sqrt[3]{x + \dotsb}}}.\]Then
\[z^3 = x + \sqrt[3]{x + \sqrt[3]{x + \dotsb}} = x + z,\]so $z^3 - z = x.$
Since $z = y,$ $y^3 - y = x = y^2.$  Then
\[y^3 - y^2 - y = 0,\]which factors as $y (y^2 - y - 1) = 0,$ so $y^2 - y - 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,
\[y = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]Since $y$ is positive,
\[y = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]Then
\[x = y^2 = \boxed{\frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}.\]
By AM-GM,
\[\frac{n}{2} + \frac{18}{n} \ge 2 \sqrt{\frac{n}{2} \cdot \frac{18}{n}} = 6.\]Equality occurs when $\frac{n}{2} = \frac{18}{n} = 3,$ which leads to $n = \boxed{6}.$
By QM-AM,
\[\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + (1 - b)^2}{2}} \ge \frac{a + (1 - b)}{2},\]so $\sqrt{a^2 + (1 - b)^2} \ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (a + (1 - b)).$  Similarly,
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{b^2 + (1 - c)^2} &\ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (b + (1 - c)), \\
\sqrt{c^2 + (1 - d)^2} &\ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (c + (1 - d)), \\
\sqrt{d^2 + (1 - a)^2} &\ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (d + (1 - a)).
\end{align*}Adding these inequalities, we get
\[\sqrt{a^2 + (1 - b)^2} + \sqrt{b^2 + (1 - c)^2} + \sqrt{c^2 + (1 - d)^2} + \sqrt{d^2 + (1 - a)^2} \ge 2 \sqrt{2}.\]Equality occurs when $a = b = c = d = \frac{1}{2}.$
Since $a$ and $1 - b$ are nonnegative,
\[\sqrt{a^2 + (1 - b)^2} \le \sqrt{a^2 + 2a(1 - b) + (1 - b)^2} = \sqrt{(a + (1 - b))^2} = a + 1 - b.\]Similarly,
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{b^2 + (1 - c)^2} &\le b + 1 - c, \\
\sqrt{c^2 + (1 - d)^2} &\le c + 1 - d, \\
\sqrt{d^2 + (1 - a)^2} &\le d + 1 - a.
\end{align*}Adding all these inequalities, we get
\[\sqrt{a^2 + (1 - b)^2} + \sqrt{b^2 + (1 - c)^2} + \sqrt{c^2 + (1 - d)^2} + \sqrt{d^2 + (1 - a)^2} \le 4.\]Equality occurs when $a = b = c = d = 0,$ and $a = b = c = d = 1.$
If we set $a = b = c = d = t,$ then
\[\sqrt{a^2 + (1 - b)^2} + \sqrt{b^2 + (1 - c)^2} + \sqrt{c^2 + (1 - d)^2} + \sqrt{d^2 + (1 - a)^2} = 4 \sqrt{t^2 + (1 - t)^2}.\]In the range $0 \le t \le 1,$ $4 \sqrt{t^2 + (1 - t)^2}$ takes on all the values from $2 \sqrt{2}$ to 4, so the possible values of the expression is the interval $\boxed{[2 \sqrt{2},4]}.$
Dividing the second inequality by 2, we get $x + 2y \le 4.$  Adding the first inequality $3x + 2y \le 7,$ we get
\[4x + 4y \le 11,\]so $x + y \le \frac{11}{4}.$
Equality occurs when $x = \frac{3}{2}$ and $y = \frac{5}{4},$ so the largest possible value of $x + y$ is $\boxed{\frac{11}{4}}.$
We hope this sum telescopes
We really hope this sum telescopes.
One thing to think about is what happens when we add up the first few terms
(The sum of the first few terms of an infinite series is called a partial sum.)  For example, when we add the first three terms of the series, we obtain a fraction whose denominator is
\[(5 + 1)(5^2 + 1)(5^4 + 1).\]We can make this product nicely collapse by multiplying it by $5 - 1$:
\begin{align*}
(5 - 1)(5 + 1)(5^2 + 1)(5^4 + 1) &= (5^2 - 1)(5^2 + 1)(5^4 + 1) \\
&= (5^4 - 1)(5^4 + 1) \\
&= 5^8 - 1.
\end{align*}More generally, if we add the first $n$ terms of the series, we can obtain a fraction with denominator $5^{2^n} - 1.$  The next term in the series has a denominator of $5^{2^n} + 1.$  Since we want the sum to telescope, we can consider the difference
\[\frac{1}{5^{2^n} + 1} - \frac{1}{5^{2^n} - 1} = \frac{2}{5^{2^{n + 1}} - 1}.\]Multiplying both sides by $2^n,$ we get
\[\frac{2^n}{5^{2^n} + 1} - \frac{2^n}{5^{2^n} - 1} = \frac{2^{n + 1}}{5^{2^{n + 1}} - 1}.\]Thus,
\[\frac{2^n}{5^{2^n} + 1} = \frac{2^n}{5^{2^n} - 1} - \frac{2^{n + 1}}{5^{2^{n + 1}} - 1}.\]The given series then telescopes as follows:
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{5 + 1} + \frac{2}{5^2 + 1} + \frac{4}{5^4 + 1} + \dotsb &= \left( \frac{1}{5 - 1} - \frac{2}{5^2 - 1} \right) + \left( \frac{2}{5^2 - 1} - \frac{4}{5^4 - 1} \right) + \left( \frac{4}{5^4 - 1} - \frac{8}{5^8 - 1} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}.
\end{align*}
Since $|6+ti| = \sqrt{6^2 + t^2} = \sqrt{t^2+36}$, the equation $|6+ti| = 10$ tells us that $\sqrt{t^2 + 36} = 10$
Squaring both sides gives $t^2 + 36= 100$, so $t^2= 64$
Since we want the positive value of $t$, we have $t = \boxed{8}$.
By Cauchy-Schwarz applied to $ \left( 1,\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2}\right) $ and $ (\sqrt{x+27},\sqrt{13-x},\sqrt{x}) $,
\[\left( 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \right) ((x + 27) + 3(13 - x) + 2x) \ge (\sqrt{x + 27} + \sqrt{13 - x} + \sqrt{x})^2.\]Hence,
\[(\sqrt{x + 27} + \sqrt{13 - x} + \sqrt{x})^2 \le 121,\]so $\sqrt{x + 27} + \sqrt{13 - x} + \sqrt{x} \le 11.$
Equality occurs when $x = 9,$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{11}.$
By AM-HM,
\[\frac{x + y + z}{3} \ge \frac{3}{\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z}}.\]Hence,
\[\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} \ge \frac{9}{x + y + z} = 9.\]Equality occurs when $x = y = z = \frac{1}{3},$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{9}.$
Seeing the expression $\sqrt[3]{x}$ twice, we make the substitution $y = \sqrt[3]{x},$ so that our inequality becomes \[y + \frac{2}{y+3} \le 0.\]Combining the terms on the left-hand side under a common denominator, we get \[\frac{y^2+3y+2}{y+3} \le 0,\]which factors as \[\frac{(y+1)(y+2)}{y+3} \le 0.\]Letting $f(y) = (y+1)(y+2)/(y+3),$ we make a sign table based on this inequality: \begin{tabular}{c|ccc|c} &$y+1$ &$y+2$ &$y+3$ &$f(y)$ \\ \hline$y<-3$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$-3<y<-2$ &$-$&$-$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$-2<y<-1$ &$-$&$+$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$y>-1$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]\end{tabular}Therefore, the inequality holds if $y < -3$ or $-2 < y < -1.$ Since the inequality is nonstrict, we must also include the values of $y$ that make $f(y) = 0,$ which are $y=-1$ and $y=-2.$ Therefore, the solutions to this inequality are \[y \in (-\infty, -3) \cup [-2, -1].\]Since $y = \sqrt[3]{x},$ we have either $\sqrt[3]{x} < -3$ or $-2 \le \sqrt[3]{x} \le -1.$ Since $\sqrt[3]{x}$ is an increasing function of $x,$ we can cube all sides of these inequalities, to get $x < -27$ and $-8 \le x \le -1,$ respectively
Therefore, \[x \in \boxed{(-\infty, -27) \cup [-8, -1]}.\]
We have \[\left|\frac56 +2i\right| = \left|\frac{1}{6}\left(5 +12i\right)\right| = \frac16|5+12i| = \frac16\sqrt{5^2 +12^2} = \boxed{\frac{13}{6}}.\]
Consider the polynomial $q(x) = p(x) - x.$  This polynomial becomes 0 at $x = 1,$ 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, so it has $x - 1,$ $x - 2,$ $x - 3,$ $x - 4,$ $x - 5,$ and $x - 6$ as factors
Also, $p(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree 6, so $q(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree 6
Hence,
\[q(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6).\]Then $q(7) = 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 720,$ so $p(7) = q(7) + 7 = \boxed{727}.$
If $x < 0,$ then $|x| = -x,$ so from the first equation, $y = 10.$  But then the second equation gives us $x = 12,$ contradiction, so $x \ge 0,$ which means $|x| = x.$
If $y > 0,$ then $|y| = y,$ so from the second equation, $x = 12.$  But the the first equation gives us $y = -14,$ contradiction, so $y \le 0,$ which means $|y| = -y.$
Thus, the given equations become $2x + y = 10$ and $x - 2y = 12.$  Solving, we find $x = \frac{32}{5}$ and $y = -\frac{14}{5},$ so $x + y = \boxed{\frac{18}{5}}.$
For $g(x) = 1 - f(x + 1)$ to be defined, we need
\[0 \le x + 1 \le 2,\]or $-1 \le x \le 1.$  As $y$ ranges over $0 \le y \le 1,$ $1 - y$ ranges from 1 to 0
Hence, $(a,b,c,d) = \boxed{(-1,1,0,1)}.$
Setting $x = y,$ we get
\[0 = f(1).\]Setting $y = 1,$ we get
\[xf(1) - f(x) = f(x),\]so $2f(x) = 0,$ which means $f(x) = \boxed{0}$ for all $x.$  (Note that this function satisfies the given functional equation.)
We have that
\[f(g(x)) = f(cx + 2) = 4(cx + 2) + c = 4cx + c + 8 = 12x + d.\]Matching coefficients, we get $4c = 12$ and $d = c + 8,$ so $c = 3,$ and $d = 3 + 8 = \boxed{11}.$
Let $r$ be an integer root of the first polynomial $p(x) = a_{10} x^{10} + a_9 x^9 + a_8 x^8 + \dots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0,$ so
\[a_{10} r^{10} + a_9 r^9 + \dots + a_1 r + a_0 = 0.\]Since $a_0$ is not equal to 0, $r$ cannot be equal to 0
Hence, we can divide both sides by $r^{10},$ to get
\[a_{10} + a_9 \cdot \frac{1}{r} + \dots + a_1 \cdot \frac{1}{r^9} + a_0 \cdot \frac{1}{r^{10}} = 0.\]Thus, $\frac{1}{r}$ is a root of the second polynomial $q(x) = a_0 x^{10} + a_1 x^9 + a_2 x^8 + \dots + a_8 x^2 + a_9 x + a_{10} = 0.$  This means that $\frac{1}{r}$ must also be an integer.
The only integers $r$ for which $\frac{1}{r}$ is also an integer are $r = 1$ and $r = -1.$  Furthermore, $r = \frac{1}{r}$ for these values, so if the only roots of $p(x)$ are 1 and $-1,$ then the multiset of roots of $q(x)$ are automatically the same as the multiset of roots of $p(x).$  Therefore, the possible multisets are the ones that contain $k$ values of 1 and $10 - k$ values of $-1,$ for $0 \le k \le 10.$  There are 11 possible values of $k,$ so there are $\boxed{11}$ possible multisets.

\]We cannot divide $12$ by $x-5$ since $12$ has lower degree
So the quotient is $2x-7$ and the remainder is $\boxed{12}$.
Since $|\overline{z}| = |z|$ for any complex number $z,$
\[|w| = \left| \frac{\overline{z}}{z} \right| = \frac{|\overline{z}|}{|z|} = \boxed{1}.\]
We perform the polynomial division: \[

\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 0 & (a-5+12)x & 2 \\
\end{array}
\]The remainder will be constant if and only if $a-5+12=0.$ So $a = \boxed{-7}.$
We try to express $w^3+z^3$ in terms of $w+z$ and $w^2+z^2.$ We have, by sum of cubes, \[w^3+z^3=(w+z)(w^2+z^2-wz),\]so we want now to express $wz$ in terms of $w+z$ and $w^2+z^2.$ To do that, we write $(w+z)^2 = w^2+z^2+2wz,$ from which it follows that $wz = \tfrac12 \left((w+z)^2 - (w^2+z^2)\right).$ Thus, \[\begin{aligned} w^3+z^3&=(w+z)(w^2+z^2-\tfrac12\left((w+z)^2-(w^2+z^2)\right)) \\ &= (w+z)\left(\tfrac32(w^2+z^2)-\tfrac12(w+z)^2\right)
\end{aligned}\]Taking magnitudes of both sides, we have \[\begin{aligned} \left|w^3+z^3\right| &= \left| (w+z)\left(\tfrac32(w^2+z^2)-\tfrac12(w+z)^2\right) \right| \\ &=|w+z| \cdot \left|\tfrac32(w^2+z^2)-\tfrac12(w+z)^2\right|
\end{aligned}\]We are given that $|w+z| = 1,$ so \[|w^3+z^3| = \left|\tfrac32(w^2+z^2)-\tfrac12(w+z)^2\right|.\]We have $\left|\tfrac32(w^2+z^2)\right| = \tfrac32 \cdot 14 = 21$ and $\left|\tfrac12(w+z)^2\right| = \tfrac12 \cdot 1^2 = \tfrac12,$ so by the triangle inequality, \[|w^3+z^3| \ge \left| 21 - \tfrac12 \right| = \boxed{\tfrac{41}2}.\]
We start by trying to get as much information as possible from what is given to us about $a$, $b$, and $c$
Since their arithmetic mean is $8$, we know that $\frac{a+b+c}{3} = 8$ which when we multiply both sides by $3$ gives us $a+b+c=24$
Since their geometric mean is $5$ we have $\sqrt[3]{abc}=5$, which when we cube both sides gives us $abc = 125$
Now since the harmonic mean is $3$, we have
$$\frac{3}{\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}}=3.$$We can simplify to get
$$\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c} = 1.$$Converting to a common denominator gives
$$\frac{ab+bc+ca}{abc}=1$$which tells us that $ab+bc+ca=abc=125$.
Now, we try and use this information to find $a^2+b^2+c^2$
Since we already know $a+b+c$, we can start by squaring that whole expression and expanding
This gives us,
$$(a+b+c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ca).$$We can rewrite the equation above as
$$a^2+b^2+c^2=(a+b+c)^2-2(ab+bc+ca).$$Since we know both expressions on the right, we can substitute them in and solve to get
$$a^2+b^2+c^2=(24)^2-2(125)=576-250=\boxed{326}.$$
We can introduce symmetry into the equation by letting $z = x - 4.$  Then $x = z + 4,$ so the equation becomes
\[(z + 1)^4 + (z - 1)^4 = -8.\]This simplifies to $2z^4 + 12z^2 + 10 = 0,$ or $z^4 + 6z^2 + 5 = 0.$  This factors as
\[(z^2 + 1)(z^2 + 5) = 0,\]so $z = \pm i$ or $z = \pm i \sqrt{5}.$
Therefore, the solutions are $\boxed{4 + i, 4 - i, 4 + i \sqrt{5}, 4 - i \sqrt{5}}.$
By QM-AM,
\[\sqrt{\frac{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2}{n}} \ge \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n}.\]Then
\[\frac{1}{n} \le \sqrt{\frac{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2}{n}} \le \sqrt{\frac{1}{100n}}.\]Hence,
\[\frac{1}{n^2} \le \frac{1}{100n},\]and $n \ge 100.$
For $n = 100,$ we can take $x_i = \frac{1}{100}$ for all $i,$ so the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{100}.$
$$f(-x) = 3^{(-x)^2-3} - |-x| = 3^{x^2-3} - |x| = f(x) $$which means $f$ is $\boxed{\text{even}}$.
The radical conjugate of $a+\sqrt{b}$ is $a-\sqrt{b}$
Hence their sum is $2a$
Then we know that $2a=-4$ which gives us $a=-2$
The product $(a+\sqrt{b})\cdot(a-\sqrt{b})=a^2-b=1.$ Plugging in the value for $a$, we can solve for $b$ to get that $b=(-2)^2-1=3$
Therefore $a+b=-2+3=\boxed{1}$.
Given the graph of a function, the function has an inverse only when every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once
Thus, the only graphs where the functions have inverses are $\boxed{\text{B,C}}.$
By partial fractions,
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{(x - 1)(x - 2)} &= \frac{1}{x - 2} - \frac{1}{x - 1}, \\
\frac{1}{(x - 2)(x - 3)} &= \frac{1}{x - 3} - \frac{1}{x - 2}, \\
\frac{1}{(x - 3)(x - 4)} &= \frac{1}{x - 4} - \frac{1}{x - 3},
\end{align*}so the given equation reduces to
\[\frac{1}{x - 4} - \frac{1}{x - 1} = \frac{1}{6}.\]Multiplying both sides by $6(x - 4)(x - 1),$ we get
\[6(x - 1) - 6(x - 4) = (x - 4)(x - 1),\]which simplifies to $x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0.$  This factors as $(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0,$ so the solutions are $\boxed{7,-2}.$
We can write
\[\frac{a + b}{c} + \frac{a + c}{b} + \frac{b + c}{a} = \frac{a}{c} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{a}.\]By AM-GM,
\[\frac{a}{c} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{a} \ge 6 \sqrt[6]{\frac{a}{c} \cdot \frac{b}{c} \cdot \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{a} \cdot \frac{c}{a}} = 6.\]Equality occurs when $a = b = c,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{6}.$
Multiplying both sides by $x-4,$ we get $x(x-4) + 45 = -10(x-4),$ or $x^2-4x+45 = -10x+40,$ which simplifies to $x^2+6x + 5 = 0.$ This quadratic factors as $(x+1)(x+5) = 0,$ so either $x=-1$ or $x=-5,$ both of which we can check are valid solutions
Therefore, the answer is \[x = \boxed{-1, \; -5}.\]
From the given equation, $\frac{x^2 + y^2}{xy} = 6,$ so $x^2 + y^2 = 6xy.$
\[a = \frac{x + y}{x - y}.\]Then
\[a^2 = \frac{x^2 + 2xy + y^2}{x^2 - 2xy + y^2} = \frac{8xy}{4xy} = 2.\]Since $y > x > 0,$ $a = \frac{x + y}{x - y}$ is negative
Therefore, $a = \boxed{-\sqrt{2}}.$
Solution #1
Let $f(r)=r^{13}+1$
Then, by the Remainder Theorem, the remainder when $f(r)$ is divided by $r-1$ is $f(1) = 1^{13}+1 = \boxed{2}$.
Solution #2
If you think about geometric series often, you may notice that
$$\frac{r^{13}-1}{r-1} = r^{12}+r^{11}+r^{10}+\cdots+r^2+r+1.$$Therefore, $r^{13}+1 = (r^{13}-1)+2 = (r^{12}+r^{11}+\cdots+r+1)(r-1)+2$, and so the remainder is $\boxed{2}$.
Numbers the rows 1, 2, 3, $\dots,$ 8 from top to bottom
Let $r_1$ be the row number of the chosen square in the first column
(For example, if the 5th square is chosen in the first column, then $r_1 = 5.$)  Then the label of that square is $\frac{1}{r_1}.$
Similarly, if $r_2$ is the row number of the chosen square in the second column, then its label is
\[\frac{1}{r_2 + 1}.\]In general, let $r_i$ be the row number of the chosen square in column $i,$ so its label is
\[\frac{1}{r_i + i - 1}.\]Then we want to minimize
\[\frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{r_2 + 1} + \frac{1}{r_3 + 2} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_8 + 7}.\]By AM-HM,
\[\frac{r_1 + (r_2 + 1) + (r_3 + 2) + \dots + (r_8 + 7)}{8} \ge \frac{8}{\frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{r_2 + 1} + \frac{1}{r_3 + 2} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_8 + 7}},\]so
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{r_2 + 1} + \frac{1}{r_3 + 2} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_8 + 7} &\ge \frac{64}{r_1 + (r_2 + 1) + (r_3 + 2) + \dots + (r_8 + 7)} \\
&= \frac{64}{r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + \dots + r_8 + 28}.
\end{align*}Since there exists one chosen square in each row, $r_1,$ $r_2,$ $r_3,$ $\dots,$ $r_8$ are equal to 1, 2, 3, $\dots,$ 8 in some order
Therefore,
\[\frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{r_2 + 1} + \frac{1}{r_3 + 2} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_8 + 7} \ge \frac{64}{1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 8 + 28} = \frac{64}{36 + 28} =  1.\]Equality occurs when we choose all eight squares labelled $\frac{1}{8},$ so the smallest possible sum is $\boxed{1}.$
The center lies at the midpoint of the line segment connecting the two foci, so the center has coordinates $\left(\frac{5+9}{2}, \frac{0+4}{2}\right) = \boxed{(7,2)}.$
Let $y = x - 2.$  Then $x = y + 2,$ so
\[(y + 2)^3 - 5(y + 2) + 7 = 0.\]This simplifies to $y^3 + 6y^2 + 7y + 5 = 0.$  The corresponding polynomial in $x$ is then $\boxed{x^3 + 6x^2 + 7x + 5}.$
We can write
\[ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6 = (3x^2 - 2x + 1)(cx^2 + dx + 6).\]Expanding, we get
\[ax^2 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6 = 3cx^4 + (-2c + 3d)x^3 + (c - 2d + 18) x^2 + (d - 12) x + 6.\]Comparing coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
a &= 3c, \\
b &= -2c + 3d, \\
32 &= c - 2d + 18, \\
-16 &= d - 12.
\end{align*}Solving, we find $a = 18,$ $b =-24,$ $c = 6,$ and $d = -4,$ so $(a,b) = \boxed{(18,-24)}.$
We can perform long division
We can also write
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^5 + 7}{x + 1} &= \frac{(x^5 + 1) + 6}{x + 1} \\
&= \frac{x^5 + 1}{x + 1} + \frac{6}{x + 1} \\
&= x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1 + \frac{6}{x - 1}.
\end{align*}Thus, the quotient is $\boxed{x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1}.$
Subtracting $3$ from both sides gives \[\frac{x}{x-1} + \frac{x+2}{2x} -3 \ge 0.\]Combining all the terms under a common denominator, we get \[\frac{x(2x) + (x+2)(x-1) - 3(x-1)(2x)}{(x-1)(2x)} \ge 0,\]or \[\frac{-3x^2+7x-2}{2x(x-1)} \ge 0.\]Factoring the numerator, we get \[\frac{-(3x-1)(x-2)}{2x(x-1)} \ge 0.\]Making a sign table for the inequality $f(x) = \frac{(3x-1)(x-2)}{x(x-1)} \le 0,$ we get:  \begin{tabular}{c|cccc|c} &$3x-1$ &$x-2$ &$x$ &$x-1$ &$f(x)$ \\ \hline$x<0$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$0<x<\frac{1}{3}$ &$-$&$-$&$+$&$-$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$\frac{1}{3}<x<1$ &$+$&$-$&$+$&$-$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$1<x<2$ &$+$&$-$&$+$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$x>2$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]\end{tabular}Therefore, we have $f(x) < 0$ when $0 < x < \tfrac13$ or $1 < x <2.$ We also have $f(x) = 0$ when $x = \tfrac13$ or $x = 2,$ so the whole solution set to the inequality is \[x \in \boxed{(0, \tfrac13] \cup (1, 2]}.\]
We have that
\[g(x^{12}) = x^{60} + x^{48} + x^{36} + x^{24} + x^{12} + 1.\]Note that
\[(x - 1)g(x) = (x - 1)(x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) = x^6 - 1.\]Also,
\begin{align*}
g(x^{12}) - 6 &= (x^{60} + x^{48} + x^{36} + x^{24} + x^{12} + 1) - 6 \\
&= (x^{60} - 1) + (x^{48} - 1) + (x^{36} - 1) + (x^{24} - 1) + (x^{12} - 1).
\end{align*}We can write
\[(x^{60} - 1) = (x^6 - 1)(x^{54} + x^{48} + x^{42} + \dots + x^6 + 1).\]In the same way, $x^{48} - 1,$ $x^{36} - 1,$ $x^{24} - 1,$ and $x^{12} - 1$ are all multiples of $x^6 - 1,$ so they are multiples of $g(x).$
We have shown that $g(x^{12}) - 6$ is a multiple of $g(x),$ so the remainder when the polynomial $g(x^{12})$ is divided by the polynomial $g(x)$ is $\boxed{6}.$
We know that the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y = f^{-1}(x)$ are reflections of each other across the line $y = x.$  If they intersect at some point $(a,b),$ where $a \neq b,$ then they must also intersect at the point $(b,a),$ which is the reflection of the point $(a,b)$ in the line $y = x.$
But we are told that the graphs have exactly one point of intersection, so it must be of the form $(a,a).$  Since this point lies on the graph of $y = f(x),$ $a = f(a).$  In other words,
\[a = a^3 + 6a^2 + 16a + 28.\]Then $a^3 + 6a^2 + 15a + 28 = 0,$ which factors as $(a + 4)(a^2 + 2a + 7) = 0.$  The quadratic factor does not have any real roots, so $a = -4.$  The point of intersection is then $\boxed{(-4,-4)}.$
Since the axis of symmetry is parallel to the $x$-axis, and the $y$-coordinate of the focus is 3, the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is also 3
Since the vertex lies on the $y$-axis, it must be at $(0,3).$  Hence, the equation of the parabola is of the form
\[x = k(y - 3)^2.\][asy]
unitsize(1 cm);
real upperparab (real x) {
return (sqrt(4*x) + 3);
real lowerparab (real x) {
return (-sqrt(4*x) + 3);
draw(graph(upperparab,0,2));

draw((0,-1)--(0,6));
draw((-1,0)--(3,0));
dot("$(1,5)$", (1,5), NW);
dot("$(0,3)$", (0,3), W);
[/asy]
Since the graph passes through $(1,5),$ we can plug in $x = 1$ and $y = 5,$ to get $1 = 4k,$ so $k = \frac{1}{4}.$
Hence, the equation of the parabola is $x = \frac{1}{4} (y - 3)^2,$ which we write as
\[\boxed{y^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0}.\]
Multiplying both sides by $(x + 1)^2,$ we get
\[(13x - x^2)(x(x + 1) + (13 - x)) = 42(x + 1)^2.\]This expands to $x^4 - 13x^3 + 55x^2 - 85x + 42 = 0,$ which factors as $(x - 1)(x - 6)(x^2 - 6x + 7) = 0.$  By the quadratic formula, the roots of $x^2 - 6x + 7 = 0$ are $3 \pm \sqrt{2}.$  Therefore, the solutions are $\boxed{1, 6, 3 + \sqrt{2}, 3 - \sqrt{2}}.$
To find the volume of the box, we multiply the three dimensions: $(x+5)(x-5)(x^{2}+25) = (x^{2}-25)(x^{2}+25) = x^{4}-625$
We want to find $x$ such that $x^{4}-625<700$, which simplifies to $x^{4}<1325$
Taking the fourth root shows us that $x$ is less than $\sqrt[4]{1325}$, which is between 6 and 7 (since $6^4=1296$ while $7^4=2401$)
So $x$ could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
However, we see that the width is $x-5$ units, and this must be a positive number, so the only value of $x$ which works is 6
Thus, there is only $\boxed{1}$ possible value of $x$.
Observe that $\lfloor 2x \rfloor$ is an integer, so it follows that $\lfloor \lfloor 2x \rfloor - 1/2 \rfloor = \lfloor 2x \rfloor - 1$
Also, $\lfloor x + 2 \rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor + 2$
Thus, our equation becomes $$\lfloor 2x \rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor + 3.$$Let $n = \lfloor x \rfloor,$ so $n \le x < n + 1.$
If $x < n + \frac{1}{2},$ then $2n \le x < 2n + 1,$ so $\lfloor 2x \rfloor = 2n,$ and
\[2n = n + 3,\]which means $n = 3.$
If $x \ge n + \frac{1}{2},$ then $2n + 1 \le x < 2n + 2,$ so $\lfloor 2x \rfloor = 2n + 1,$ and
\[2n + 1 = n + 3,\]which means $n = 2.$
Therefore, the set of solutions is $x \in \boxed{\left[ \frac{5}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right)}.$
Taking the absolute value of both sides, we get $|(z + 1)^5| = |32z^5|.$  Then
\[|z + 1|^5 = 32|z|^5,\]so $|z + 1| = 2|z|.$  Hence, $|z + 1|^2 = 4|z|^2.$
Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers
\[|x + yi + 1|^2 = 4|x + yi|^2,\]which becomes
\[(x + 1)^2 + y^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2).\]This simplifies to
\[3x^2 - 2x + 3y^2 + 1 = 0.\]Completing the square, we get
\[\left( x - \frac{1}{3} \right)^2 + y^2 = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2.\]Thus, the radius of the circle is $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.$
Recall the sum of cubes factorization $a^3+b^3= (a+b)(a^{2}-ab+b^{2}).$ We plug in the numbers from the equations given to obtain $81=(3)(a^2-ab+b^2)$
Therefore, $a^2-ab+b^2=27$
We also know that $(a+b)^2=9=a^2+2ab+b^2$
We use the two equations  $$a^2+2ab+b^2=9$$and  $$a^2-ab+b^2=27.$$By subtracting the second equation from the first, we get that $2ab+ab=9-27$
Therefore, $3ab=-18$, so $ab=\boxed{-6}$.
To clear denominators, we multiply both sides by $(x-2)(x-4)(x-3)$: \[(x-4)(x-3) + (x-2)(x-3) = 3(x-2)(x-4),\]or \[(x^2-7x+12) + (x^2-5x+6) = 3(x^2-6x+8).\]Moving all the terms to the right-hand side, we get \[x^2 - 6x + 6= 0.\]By the quadratic formula, \[x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{6^2 - 4 \cdot 6}}{2} = 3 \pm \sqrt{3}.\]Therefore, the smallest solution is $x = \boxed{3 - \sqrt3}.$
Note that $A$ is the focus of the parabola $y^2 = 4x,$ and the directrix is $x = -1.$  Then by definition of the parabola, the distance from $P$ to $A$ is equal to the distance from $P$ to the line $x = -1.$  Let $Q$ be the point on $x = -1$ closest to $P,$ and let $R$ be the point on $x = -1$ closest to $B.$

Then by the triangle inequality,
\[AP + BP = QP + BP \ge BQ.\]By the Pythagorean Theorem, $BQ = \sqrt{BR^2 + QR^2} \ge BR = 6.$
Equality occurs when $P$ coincides with the intersection of line segment $\overline{BR}$ with the parabola, so the minimum value of $AP + BP$ is $\boxed{6}.$
Let $a = a_1,$ and let $d$ be the common difference, so
\[S_n = \frac{2a + (n - 1)d}{2} \cdot n.\]Then
\begin{align*}
T_n &= \sum_{k = 1}^n \left( \frac{2a + (k - 1) d}{2} \cdot k \right) \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^n \left( \left( a - \frac{d}{2} \right) k + \frac{d}{2} k^2 \right) \\
&= \left( a - \frac{d}{2} \right) \sum_{k = 1}^n k + \frac{d}{2} \sum_{k = 1}^n k^2 \\
&= \left( a - \frac{d}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + \frac{d}{2} \cdot \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} \\
&= \frac{n(n + 1)(3a + (n - 1)d)}{6}.
\end{align*}We are told the value of
\[S_{2019} = \frac{2a + 2018d}{2} \cdot 2019 = 2019 (a + 1009d),\]which means the value of $a + 1009d$ is uniquely determined
Then the value of $3(a + 1009d) = 3a + 3027d$ is uniquely determined
Thus, we can determine $T_n$ for $n = 3027 + 1 = \boxed{3028}.$
Let $s = a + b.$  By QM-AM,
\[\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}} \ge \frac{a + b}{2} = \frac{s}{2}.\]Then $\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \ge \frac{s^2}{4},$ so $a^2 + b^2 \ge \frac{s^2}{2}.$  Hence,
\[a^2 + b^2 + \frac{1}{(a + b)^2} \ge \frac{s^2}{2} + \frac{1}{s^2}.\]By AM-GM,
\[\frac{s^2}{2} + \frac{1}{s^2} \ge 2 \sqrt{\frac{s^2}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{s^2}} = \sqrt{2}.\]Equality occurs when $a = b$ and $s^2 = \sqrt{2}.$  The numbers $a = b = 2^{-3/4}$ satisfy these conditions.
Therefore, the minimum value is $\boxed{\sqrt{2}}.$
The lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axis are $\sqrt{25} = 5$ and $\sqrt{9} = 3.$ Then the distance from the center $(0,0)$ of the ellipse to each focus is $\sqrt{5^2-3^2} = 4,$ so the foci have coordinates $(\pm4, 0).$
Without loss of generality, assume that the parabola has its focus at $(4,0).$ Its directrix is the line containing the minor axis, which is the $y-$axis
Then the vertex of the parabola must be the point $(2,0),$ so its equation is of the form \[x = Ay^2 + 2\]for some value of $A.$ Since the distance from the vertex to the focus is $2,$ we have $2 = \tfrac{1}{4A},$ so $A = \tfrac{1}{8},$ and the equation of the parabola is \[x = \frac{y^2}8 + 2.\]The parabola and ellipse are shown together below

[/asy] To find the intersection points of the parabola and ellipse, we solve the system \[\begin{aligned} \frac{x^2}{25} + \frac{y^2}9 &= 1, \\ x &=\frac{y^2}8+ 2 .\end{aligned}\]Multiplying the first equation by $9$ and the second by $8,$ we can then eliminate $y$ by adding the two equations: \[\frac{9x^2}{25} + y^2 + 8x = y^2 + 25,\]or \[9x^2 + 200x - 625=0.\]This quadratic factors as \[(9x-25)(x+25) = 0.\]Since $x = \tfrac{y^2}{8} + 2,$ it must be positive, so we have $x = \tfrac{25}{9}.$ Solving for $y$ in the equation $\tfrac{25}{9} = \tfrac{y^2}{8} + 2,$ we get $y = \pm \tfrac{2\sqrt{14}}{3}.$ Therefore, the distance between the two points is $2 \cdot \tfrac{2\sqrt{14}}{3} = \boxed{\tfrac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}}.$
Adding the given equations, we get
\[\frac{c(a + b)}{a + b} + \frac{a(b + c)}{b + c} + \frac{b(c + a)}{c + a} = 1,\]which simplifies to $a + b + c = 1.$
Subtracting the equations given in the problem, we get
\[\frac{c(b - a)}{a + b} + \frac{a(c - b)}{b + c} + \frac{b(a - c)}{c + a} = 19.\]Let
\begin{align*}
u &= \frac{a}{a + b} + \frac{b}{b + c} + \frac{c}{c + a}, \\
v &= \frac{b}{a + b} + \frac{c}{b + c} + \frac{a}{c + a},
\end{align*}so $u + v = 3.$  Also,
\begin{align*}
u - v &= \frac{a - b}{a + b} + \frac{b - c}{b + c} + \frac{c - a}{c + a} \\
&= (a + b + c) \frac{a - b}{a + b} + (a + b + c) \frac{b - c}{b + c} + (a + b + c) \frac{c - a}{c + a} \\
&= a - b + \frac{c(a - b)}{a + b} + b - c + \frac{a(b - c)}{b + c} + c - a + \frac{b(c - a)}{c + a} \\
&= -19.
\end{align*}Subtracting the equations $u + v = 3$ and $u - v = -19,$ we get $2v = 22,$ so $v = \boxed{11}.$
The midpoint of the line segment is given by the average of the end-points, which is
\[\frac{(-11 + 3i) + (3 - 7i)}{2} = \boxed{-4 - 2i}.\][asy]

Setting $y = 0,$ we get
\[f(0) = f \left( \frac{x^2}{2} \right) + x^2.\]Hence, $f(u) = 1 - 2u$ for all $u \ge 0.$
Setting $y = 1,$ we get
\[f(x) =  f \left( \frac{x^2 + 1}{2} \right) + (x - 1)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot \frac{x^2 + 1}{2} + (x - 1)^2 = \boxed{1 - 2x}.\]
By the triangle inequality, a nondegenerate triangle with these side lengths exists if and only if \[\left\{ \begin{aligned}\log_{10} 75 + \log_{10} n &> \log_{10} 12, \\ \log_{10}12 + \log_{10} 75 &> \log_{10} n, \\ \log_{10} 12 + \log_{10} n &> \log_{10} 75
\end{aligned} \right.\]The first inequality is always true, because $\log_{10} 75 > \log_{10} 12$ and $\log_{10} n > 0.$
The second inequality gives $\log_{10}(12 \cdot 75) > \log_{10} n,$ so $12 \cdot 75 = 900 > n.$
The third inequality gives $\log_{10}(12n) > \log_{10} 75,$ so $12n > 75,$ or $n > \tfrac{75}{12} = 6.25.$
Thus, the possible values for $n$ are $n = 7, 8, 9, \ldots, 899,$ which makes $899 - 7 + 1 = \boxed{893}$ values of $n.$
Let the four roots be $a,$ $a + d,$ $a  + 2d,$ and $a + 3d.$  Then by Vieta's formulas, their sum is 0:
\[4a + 6d = 0.\]Then $d = -\frac{2}{3} a,$ so the four roots are $a,$ $\frac{a}{3},$ $-\frac{a}{3},$ and $-a.$  Their product is
\[a \cdot \frac{a}{3} \cdot \left( -\frac{a}{3} \right) (-a) = \frac{a^4}{9} = 225,\]so $a = \pm 3 \sqrt{5}.$  Hence, the four roots are $3 \sqrt{5},$ $\sqrt{5},$ $-\sqrt{5},$ $-3 \sqrt{5},$ and the polynomial is
\[(x - 3 \sqrt{5})(x - \sqrt{5})(x + \sqrt{5})(x + 3 \sqrt{5}) = (x^2 - 5)(x^2 - 45) = x^4 - 50x^2 + 225.\]Thus, $j = \boxed{-50}.$
Setting $x = 4,$ we get
\[3f(4) - 2 f \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) = 4.\]Setting $x = \frac{1}{4},$ we get
\[3 f \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) - 2f(4) = \frac{1}{4}.\]We can view these equations as a system in $f(4)$ and $f \left( \frac{1}{4} \right).$  Solving this system, we find $f(4) = \boxed{\frac{5}{2}}.$
Let $b_n = a_{n + 1} - a_n.$  Then
\begin{align*}
b_n &= (11a_n - (n + 1)) - a_n \\
&= 10a_n - (n + 1) \\
&= 10(11a_{n - 1} - n) - (n + 1) \\
&= 11(10a_{n - 1} - n) - 1 \\
&= 11b_{n - 1} - 1.
\end{align*}Hence,
\[b_n - \frac{1}{10} = 11b_{n - 1} - \frac{11}{10} = 11 \left( b_{n - 1} - \frac{1}{10} \right).\]If $b_1 < \frac{1}{10},$ then the sequence $b_1,$ $b_2,$ $\dots$ is decreasing and goes to $-\infty,$ so the sequence $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $\dots$ goes to $-\infty$ as well.
Hence, $b_1 \ge \frac{1}{10}.$  Then $a_2 - a_1 \ge \frac{1}{10},$ so
\[11a_1 - 2 = a_2 \ge a_1 + \frac{1}{10}.\]This implies $a_1 \ge \frac{21}{100}.$
If $a_1= \frac{21}{100},$ then the sequence $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $\dots$ is increasing (since $b_n = \frac{1}{10}$ for all $n$), so all the terms are positive
Therefore, the smallest possible value of $a_1$ is $\boxed{\frac{21}{100}}.$
If $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1,$ then the other factor must be linear, where the coefficient of $x$ is $a,$ and the constant coefficient is $-1.$  Thus
\[(x^2 - x - 1)(ax - 1) = ax^3 + bx^2 + 1.\]Expanding, we get
\[ax^3 - (a + 1) x^2 + (1 - a) x + 1 = ax^3 + bx^2 + 1.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
-(a + 1) &= b, \\
1 - a &= 0.
\end{align*}Hence, $a = 1.$  Then $b = -(a + 1) = \boxed{-2}.$
By QM-AM,
\[\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}} \ge \frac{a + b}{2}.\]Since $a^2 + b^2 = c^2,$
\[\frac{c}{\sqrt{2}} \ge \frac{a + b}{2},\]so
\[\frac{a + b}{c} \le \sqrt{2}.\]Equality occurs when $a = b,$ so the largest possible value is $\boxed{\sqrt{2}}.$
We'll use this helpful result a few times: for any real numbers $a$ and $b$, the graph of \[|x-a|+|y-b|=1\]is a "diamond": a square of side length $\sqrt{2}$ centered at $(a, b)$ whose sides form angles of $45^\circ$ with the axes
(To see this, first draw the graph of $|x| + |y| = 1$
Then, the graph of $|x-a|+|y-b|=1$ is just the result of translating in the $x$-direction by $a$, and then in the $y$-direction by $b$.)
Since the given equation only involves $|x|$ and $|y|$, it is symmetric about the two axes
That is, it is sufficient to consider only the first quadrant, and then multiply our answer by $4$ to account for all four quadrants
So, assume $x, y \ge 0$.Then the equation becomes \[\Big|\big| x-2\big|-1\Big|+\Big|\big| y-2\big|-1\Big|=1.\]Seeing $|x-2|$ and $|y-2|$, we take cases on the values of $x$ and $y$ relative to $2$:
If $0 \le x, y \le 2$, then the given equation becomes \[\Big|(2-x)-1\Big|+\Big|(2-y)-1\Big|=1 \implies |1-x| + |1-y| = 1.\]This is the equation of the standard diamond centered at $(1, 1)$, which is completely contained in the region $0 \le x, y \le 2$.
If $0 \le x \le 2 \le y$, then the given equation becomes \[\Big|(2-x)-1\Big|+\Big|(y-2)-1\Big|=1 \implies |1-x| + |y-3| = 1.\]This is the equation of the standard diamond centered at $(1, 3)$, which is again contained in the correct region.
If $0 \le y \le 2 \le x$, then we get the standard diamond centered at $(3,1)$, as in the last case.
If $2 \le x, y$, then the given equation becomes \[\Big|(x-2)-1\Big|+\Big|(y-2)-1\Big|=1 \implies |x-3| + |y-3| = 1.\]This is the equation of the standard diamond centered at $(3, 3)$, which is again contained in the region $2 \le x, y$.
Thus, the graph of the given equation in the first quadrant consists of four standard diamonds, so the graph of the given equation in the whole plane consists of $4 \cdot 4 = 16$ standard diamonds
These diamonds do not overlap, and each one has perimeter $4\sqrt{2}$
So, the overall length of the lines that make up the graph is $16 \cdot 4\sqrt{2} = \boxed{64\sqrt{2}}$.
Below is the whole graph of the equation (tick marks are at $x, y = \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$).

Let $g(z) = (1 - z)^{b_1} (1 - z^2)^{b_2} (1 - z^3)^{b_3} (1 - z^4)^{b_4} (1 - z^5)^{b_5} \dotsm (1 - z^{32})^{b_{32}}.$  Since $g(z)$ reduces to $1 - 2z$ if we eliminate all powers of $z$ that are $z^{33}$ or higher, we write
\[g(z) \equiv 1 - 2z \pmod{z^{33}}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
g(-z) &= (1 + z)^{b_1} (1 - z^2)^{b_2} (1 + z^3)^{b_3} (1 - z^4)^{b_4} (1 + z^5)^{b_5} \dotsm (1 - z^{32})^{b_{32}} \\
&\equiv 1 + 2z \pmod{z^{33}},
\end{align*}so
\begin{align*}
g(z) g(-z) &= (1 - z^2)^{b_1 + 2b_2} (1 - z^4)^{2b_4} (1 - z^6)^{b_3 + 2b_6} (1 - z^8)^{2b_8} \dotsm (1 - z^{30})^{b_{15} + 2b_{30}} (1 - z^{32})^{2b_{32}} \\
&\equiv (1 + 2z)(1 - 2z) \equiv 1 - 2^2 z^2 \pmod{z^{33}}.
\end{align*}Let $g_1(z^2) = g(z) g(-z),$ so
\begin{align*}
g_1(z) &= (1 - z)^{c_1} (1 - z^2)^{c_2} (1 - z^3)^{c_3} (1 - z^4)^{c_4} \dotsm (1 - z^{16})^{c_{16}} \\
&\equiv 1 - 2^2 z \pmod{z^{17}},
\end{align*}where $c_i = b_i + 2b_{2i}$ if $i$ is odd, and $c_i = 2b_{2i}$ if $i$ is even
In particular, $c_{16} = 2b_{32}.$
\begin{align*}
g_1(z) g_1(-z) &= (1 - z^2)^{c_1 + 2c_2} (1 - z^4)^{2c_4} (1 - z^6)^{c_3 + 2c_6} (1 - z^8)^{2c_8} \dotsm (1 - z^{14})^{c_7 + 2c_{14}} (1 - z^{16})^{2c_{16}} \\
&\equiv (1 - 2^2 z)(1 + 2^2 z) \equiv 1 - 2^4 z^2 \pmod{z^{17}}.
\end{align*}Thus, let $g_2(z^2) = g_1(z) g_1(-z),$ so
\begin{align*}
g_2 (z) &= (1 - z)^{d_1} (1 - z^2)^{d_2} (1 - z^3)^{d_3} (1 - z)^{d_4} \dotsm (1 - z^7)^{d_7} (1 - z^8)^{d_8} \\
&\equiv 1 - 2^4 z \pmod{z^9},
\end{align*}where $d_i = c_i + 2c_{2i}$ if $i$ is odd, and $d_i = 2c_{2i}$ if $i$ is even
In particular, $d_8 = 2c_{16}.$
Similarly, we obtain a polynomial $g_3(z)$ such that
\[g_3(z) = (1 - z)^{e_1} (1 - z^2)^{e_2} (1 - z^3)^{e_3} (1 - z)^{e_4} \equiv 1 - 2^8 z \pmod{z^5},\]and a polynomial $g_4(z)$ such that
\[g_4(z) = (1 - z)^{f_1} (1 - z^2)^{f_2} \equiv 1 - 2^{16} z \pmod{z^3}.\]Expanding, we get
\begin{align*}
g_4(z) &= (1 - z)^{f_1} (1 - z^2)^{f_2} \\
&= \left( 1 - f_1 z + \binom{f_1}{2} z^2 - \dotsb \right) \left( 1 - f_2 z^2 + \dotsb \right) \\
&= 1 - f_1 z + \left( \binom{f_1}{2} - f_2 \right) z^2 + \dotsb.
\end{align*}Hence, $f_1 = 2^{16}$ and $\binom{f_1}{2} - f_2 = 0,$ so
\[f_2 = \binom{f_1}{2} = \binom{2^{16}}{2} = \frac{2^{16} (2^{16} - 1)}{2} = 2^{31} - 2^{15}.\]We have that $f_2 = 2e_4 = 4d_8 = 8c_{16} = 16b_{32},$ so
\[b_{32} = \frac{f_2}{16} = \boxed{2^{27} - 2^{11}}.\]We leave it to the reader to find a polynomial that actually satisfies the given condition.
Since $|{-4+ti}| = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + t^2} = \sqrt{t^2+16}$, the equation $|{-4+ti}| = 2\sqrt{13}$ tells us that $\sqrt{t^2 + 16} = 2\sqrt{13}$
Squaring both sides gives $t^2 + 16= 52$, so $t^2= 36$
Since we want the positive value of $t$, we have $t = \boxed{6}$.
We have that
$$g(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^2 + 1 = 2 +1 = 3.$$Then,
$$f(g(\sqrt{2})) = f(3) = 4 - 3(3) = 4 - 9 = \boxed{-5}.$$
The left-hand side satisfies \[|x_1| + |x_2| + \dots + |x_n| < 1 + 1 + \dots + 1 = n,\]while the right-hand side satisfies \[19 + |x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n| \ge 19.\]Therefore, $n > 19,$ so $n \ge 20.$ It is possible that $n=20,$ since, for example, we can choose \[\begin{aligned} x_1 = x_2 = \dots = x_{10} &= \tfrac{19}{20}, \\ x_{11} =x_{12} = \dots =x_{20}& = -\tfrac{19}{20}, \end{aligned}\]which makes $|x_1| + |x_2| + \dots = |x_{20}| = 19$ and $|x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_{20}| = 0.$ Therefore the answer is $\boxed{20}.$
We know that $3\sqrt{10}=|3+ni|=\sqrt{3^2+n^2}$
Squaring both sides gives $90 = 9 +n^2$, from which we quickly get our solution of $n=\boxed{9}$.
The first two vertices of $V$ have magnitude $\sqrt{2}$, while the other four have magnitude $\dfrac{1}{2}$
In order for $P=-1$, it must be the case that $|P|=1$, which only happens if there are two magnitude-$\sqrt{2}$ vertices for each magnitude-$\dfrac{1}{2}$ one
Define $P_1$ as the product of the magnitude-$\sqrt{2}$ vertices chosen and $P_2$ as the product of the magnitude-$\dfrac{1}{2}$ vertices chosen.
There are $\dbinom{12}{8}$ ways to select which of the 12 draws come up with a magnitude-$\sqrt{2}$ number
The arguments of those numbers are all $\pm\dfrac{\pi}{2}$, so $P_1$ has an argument that is a multiple of $\pi$
Half of the $2^8$ draw sequences will produce a result with argument equivalent to $0$ and the other half will have an argument equivalent to $\pi$.
Similarly, the arguments of the other four numbers are $\dfrac{\pi}{4}+k\cdot\dfrac{\pi}{2}$, so $P_2$ has argument $k\cdot\dfrac{\pi}{2}$ for some integer $k$
The $4^4$ ways to select four magnitude-$\dfrac{1}{2}$ numbers are equally likely to produce any of the four possible product arguments.
In order for $P=-1$, the argument of the product must be $-\dfrac{\pi}{2}$
That happens only if:
(a) $P_1$ has argument $0$ and $P_2$ has argument $-\dfrac{\pi}{2}$, which happens with probability $\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot\dfrac{1}{4}=\dfrac{1}{8}$.
(b) $P_2$ has argument $\pi$ and $P_2$ has argument $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$, which also happens with probability $\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot\dfrac{1}{4}=\dfrac{1}{8}$.
Putting these cases together, we find that $\dfrac{1}{8}+\dfrac{1}{8}=\dfrac{1}{4}$ of the $2^8\cdot 4^4=2^{16}$ sequences of eight magnitude-$\sqrt{2}$ and four magnitude-$\dfrac{1}{2}$ vertices will have the correct argument for $P=-1$.
The probability that $P=-1$ is
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{\dbinom{12}{4}\cdot\dfrac{1}{4}\cdot 2^{16}}{6^{12}} &= \dfrac{\dbinom{12}{4}4}{3^{12}} \\
&= \dfrac{12\cdot 11\cdot 10\cdot 9\cdot 4}{4!\cdot 3^{12}} \\
&= \dfrac{220}{3^{10}}
\end{align*}The final answer is $220 + 3 + 10 = \boxed{233}.$

Then the surface area constraint is
$$ah + bh + \frac12 ab \sin \theta = 24,$$and the volume is
$$V = \frac12 abh \sin \theta.$$Let $X = ah, Y = bh, Z = (ab \sin \theta) / 2$ be the areas of the three faces
Then $X + Y + Z = 24$, and
\[XYZ = \frac{1}{2} a^2 b^2 h^2 \sin \theta = \frac{2}{\sin \theta} \left( \frac{1}{2} abh \sin \theta \right)^2 = \frac{2V^2}{\sin \theta}.\]Now the AM-GM inequality yields
$$(XYZ)^{1/3} \leq \frac{X+Y+Z}{3} = 8,$$so $XYZ \le 512$
\[\frac{2V^2}{\sin \theta} = XYZ \le 512,\]so
\[V^2 \le 256 \sin \theta \le 256,\]which means $V \le 16$.
Equality occurs for $a = b = 4$, $h = 2$, and $\theta = \pi/2$, so the maximum volume of the prism is $\boxed{16}$.
First, we can take out a factor of $\omega^{16}$:
\[\omega^{16} + \omega^{18} + \omega^{20} + \dots + \omega^{54} = \omega^{16} (1 + \omega^2 + \omega^4 + \dots + \omega^{38}).\]By the formula for a geometric series,
\[\omega^{16} (1 + \omega^2 + \omega^4 + \dots + \omega^{38}) = \omega^{16} \cdot \frac{1 - \omega^{40}}{1 - \omega^2}.\](Note that this expression is valid, because $\omega \neq 1$ and $\omega \neq -1.$)
Since $\omega^7 = 1,$
\[\omega^{16} \cdot \frac{1 - \omega^{40}}{1 - \omega^2} = \omega^2 \cdot \frac{1 - \omega^5}{1 - \omega^2} = \frac{\omega^2 - \omega^7}{1 - \omega^2} = \frac{\omega^2 - 1}{1 - \omega^2} = \boxed{-1}.\]
From $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dots + a_n = n^2 a_n,$
\[(n^2 - 1) a_n = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{n - 2} + a_{n - 1}.\]Likewise,
\[((n - 1)^2 - 1) a_{n - 1} = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{n - 2}.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[(n^2 - 1) a_n - ((n - 1)^2 - 1) a_{n - 1} = a_{n - 1},\]so
\[(n^2 - 1) a_n = (n - 1)^2 a_{n - 1}.\]Then $(n - 1)(n + 1) a_n = (n - 1)^2 a_{n - 1},$ so
\[a_n = \frac{n - 1}{n + 1} \cdot a_{n - 1}\]for all $n \ge 2.$
Therefore,
\begin{align*}
a_n &= \frac{n - 1}{n + 1} \cdot a_{n - 1} \\
&= \frac{n - 1}{n + 1} \cdot \frac{n - 2}{n} \cdot a_{n - 2} \\
&= \frac{n - 1}{n + 1} \cdot \frac{n - 2}{n} \cdot \frac{n - 3}{n - 1} \cdot a_{n - 3} \\
&= \dotsb \\
&= \frac{n - 1}{n + 1} \cdot \frac{n - 2}{n} \cdot \frac{n - 3}{n - 1} \dotsb \frac{2}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot a_1 \\
&= \frac{2a_1}{n(n + 1)}.
\end{align*}We are told that $a_{63} = 1,$ so
\[\frac{2a_1}{63 \cdot 64} = 1.\]Thus, $a_1 = \boxed{2016}.$
Setting $x = 4$ in $f(g(x)) = x^2,$ we get
\[f(g(4)) = 16.\]Then
\[g(f(g(4)) = g(16) = 16.\]But $g(f(g(4)) = [g(4)]^3,$ so $[g(4)]^3 = \boxed{16}.$
Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers
Then from the condition $|z| = 1,$ $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1,$ so $x^2 + y^2 = 1.$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{1 - z} &= \frac{1}{1 - x - yi} \\
&= \frac{1 - x + yi}{(1 - x - yi)(1 - x + yi)} \\
&= \frac{1 - x + yi}{(1 - x)^2 + y^2} \\
&= \frac{1 - x + yi}{1 - 2x + x^2 + y^2} \\
&= \frac{1 - x + yi}{2 - 2x}.
\end{align*}The real part of this complex number is $\frac{1 - x}{2 - 2x} = \frac{1 - x}{2(1 - x)} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
We have that
\[(1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i,\]so $(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = 4i^2 = \boxed{-4}.$
For the given function to have a horizontal asymptote, it can't go to infinity as $x$ goes to infinity
This is only possible if the numerator has the same or smaller degree than the denominator
Since the denominator has degree 5, the largest possible degree of $q(x)$ that will allow the function to have a horizontal asymptote is $\boxed{5}.$
We note that 5 is in fact possible, because if we take $q(x) = x^5,$ then the rational function has horizontal asymptote $y = \frac 12.$
By the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are all the divisors of 15 (including negative divisors), which are $-15,$ $-5,$ $-3,$ $-1,$ $1,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $15.$  Checking, we find that the only integer roots are $\boxed{-3,1,5}.$
The graph of $y = f(x - 1)$ is produced by taking the graph of $y = f(x)$ and shifting one unit to the right
The correct graph is $\boxed{\text{D}}.$
Squaring the equation $a + b + c = 0,$ we get
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc) = 0.\]Hence, $2(ab + ac + bc) = -(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \le 0,$ so
\[ab + ac + bc \le 0.\]Equality occurs when $a = b = c = 0.$
Now, set $c = 0,$ so $a + b = 0,$ or $b = -a.$  Then
\[ab + ac + bc = ab = -a^2\]can take on all nonpositive values
Therefore, the set of all possible values of $ab + ac + bc$ is $\boxed{(-\infty,0]}.$
Let $a = \log_2 x$ and $b = \log_3 y.$  Since $x > 1$ and $y > 1,$ $a > 0$ and $b > 0.$
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
a^4 + b^4 + 8 &= a^4 + b^4 + 4 + 4 \\
&\ge 4 \sqrt[4]{(a^4)(b^4)(4)(4)} \\
&= 8ab.
\end{align*}Since $a^4 + b^4 + 8 = 8ab,$ we have equality
Therefore, $a^4 = 4$ and $b^4 = 4.$  Then $a = \sqrt[4]{4} = \sqrt{2},$ so
\[x = 2^a = 2^{\sqrt{2}}.\]Similarly, $b = \sqrt[4]{4} = \sqrt{2},$ so
\[y = 3^b = 3^{\sqrt{2}}.\]Hence, $x^{\sqrt{2}} + y^{\sqrt{2}} = 2^2 + 3^2 = \boxed{13}.$
Each of the terms is of the form $x^4 + 324$
To factor, we write: \[\begin{aligned} x^4 + 324 &= (x^4 + 36x^2 + 324) - 36x^2\\& = (x^2+18)^2 - 36x^2 \\& = (x^2-6x+18)(x^2+6x+18) \\ &= (x(x-6)+18)(x(x+6)+18)
\end{aligned}\]Therefore, the given expression equals \[\frac{(10\cdot4+18)(10\cdot16+18)(22\cdot16+18)(22\cdot28+18) \dotsm (58\cdot52+18)(58\cdot64+18)}{(4\cdot(-2)+18)(4\cdot10+18)(16\cdot10+18)(16\cdot22+18) \dotsm (52\cdot46+18)(52\cdot58+18)}.\]Nearly all the terms cancel, leaving just \[\frac{58 \cdot 64 + 18}{4 \cdot (-2) + 18} = \boxed{373}.\]Remark
The factorization $x^4+324 = (x^2-6x+18)(x^2+6x+18)$ is a special case of the Sophie Germain identity, which is derived in the same way; it states that \[a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2-2ab+2b^2)(a^2+2ab+2b^2).\]
Since the coefficients are real, another root is $1 - i \sqrt{3}.$  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is 0, so the third root is $-2.$  Hence, the cubic polynomial is
\begin{align*}
(x - 1 - i \sqrt{3})(x - 1 + i \sqrt{3})(x + 2) &= ((x - 1)^2 - (i \sqrt{3})^2)(x + 2) \\
&= ((x - 1)^2 + 3)(x + 2) \\
&= x^3 + 8.
\end{align*}Thus, $a = 0$ and $b = 8,$ so $a + b = \boxed{8}.$
To get a handle on the constant $t,$ we can look at some particular cases.
Suppose we let $AB$ approach a vertical line
Then $\frac{1}{AC}$ approaches 0, and $B$ approaches $(0,0),$ so $\frac{1}{AC} + \frac{1}{BC}$ approaches $c.$  Hence,
\[t = \frac{1}{c}.\]Now, suppose we take $A = (\sqrt{c},c)$ and $B = (-\sqrt{c},c).$  Then
\[t = \frac{1}{AC} + \frac{1}{BC} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{c}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{c}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{c}}.\]Hence, $\frac{1}{c} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{c}},$ so $\sqrt{c} = \frac{1}{2},$ and $c = \frac{1}{4}.$  Therefore, $t = \boxed{4}.$  (Note that this makes $C$ the focus of the parabola.)
For a full solution, let's check that this value works
Let $y = mx + \frac{1}{4}$ be the equation of line $AB.$  Setting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[x^2 = mx + \frac{1}{4},\]or $x^2 - mx - c = 0.$  Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation
By Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = m$ and $x_1 x_2 = -\frac{1}{4}.$
Also, $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1,x_1^2)$ and $(x_2,x_2^2)$ in some order, so
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{AC} + \frac{1}{BC} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{x_1^2 + (x_1^2 - \frac{1}{4})^2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{x_2^2 + (x_2^2 - \frac{1}{4})^2}} \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_1^4 - \frac{1}{2} x_1^2 + \frac{1}{16}}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{x_2^2 + x_2^4 - \frac{1}{2} x_2^2 + \frac{1}{16}}} \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{x_1^4 + \frac{1}{2} x_1^2 + \frac{1}{16}}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{x_2^4 + \frac{1}{2} x_2^2 + \frac{1}{16}}} \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{(x_1^2 + \frac{1}{4})^2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{(x_2^2 + \frac{1}{4})^2}} \\
&= \frac{1}{x_1^2 + \frac{1}{4}} + \frac{1}{x_2^2 + \frac{1}{4}}.
\end{align*}We have that $x_1^2 x_2^2 = (x_1 x_2)^2 = \left( -\frac{1}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{16}$ and
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1 x_2 = m^2 + \frac{1}{2}.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{x_1^2 + \frac{1}{4}} + \frac{1}{x_2^2 + \frac{1}{4}} &= \frac{x_1^2 + \frac{1}{4} + x_2^2 + \frac{1}{4}}{(x_1^2 + \frac{1}{4})(x_2^2 + \frac{1}{4})} \\
&= \frac{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \frac{1}{2}}{x_1^2 x_2^2 + \frac{1}{4} (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + \frac{1}{16}} \\
&= \frac{m^2 + 1}{\frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{4} (m^2 + \frac{1}{2}) + \frac{1}{16}} \\
&= \frac{m^2 + 1}{\frac{1}{4} m^2 + \frac{1}{4}} \\
\end{align*}
We may think of trying to apply AM-GM directly to all five terms
Ignoring the constants, this give us a term of
\[\sqrt[5]{x^2 \cdot xy \cdot y^2 \cdot yz \cdot z^2} = \sqrt[5]{x^3 y^4 z^3}.\]This doesn't work, because the condition is $xyz = \frac{2}{3},$ so we want a power of $xyz.$  So, to get more one power of $y,$ relative to $x$ and $z,$ we split every term except $y^2$ in half:
\[\frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^2}{2} + 3xy + 3xy + 18y^2 + 6yz + 6yz + 2z^2 + 2z^2.\]Then by AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
&\frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^2}{2} + 3xy + 3xy + 18y^2 + 6yz + 6yz + 2z^2 + 2z^2 \\
&\ge 9 \sqrt[9]{\frac{x^2}{2} \cdot \frac{x^2}{2} \cdot 3xy \cdot 3xy \cdot 18y^2 \cdot 6yz \cdot 6yz \cdot 2z^2 \cdot 2z^2} \\
&= 9 \sqrt[9]{5832x^6 y^6 z^6} \\
&= 18.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $\frac{x^2}{2} = 3xy = 18y^2 = 6yz = 2z^2.$  Along with the condition $xyz = \frac{2}{3},$ we can solve to get $x = 2,$ $y = \frac{1}{3},$ $z = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{18}.$
Let $z = a + bi,$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers
Then $z^2 = (a + bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi - b^2$ and $|z|^2 = a^2 + b^2,$ so
\[a^2 + 2abi - b^2 + a^2 + b^2 = 3 - 5i.\]Equating real and imaginary parts, we get
\begin{align*}
2a^2 &= 3, \\
2ab &= -5.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $a^2 = \frac{3}{2}.$  From the second equation,
\[b = -\frac{5}{2a},\]so
\[b^2 = \frac{25}{4a^2} = \frac{25}{4 \cdot 3/2} = \frac{25}{6}.\]Therefore,
\[|z|^2 = a^2 + b^2 = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{25}{6} = \boxed{\frac{17}{3}}.\]
Since $(n-2)(n+4)(n+8)=0$ when $n=2, -4,$ or $-8$, we will consider the four cases $-11 \leq n < -8$, $-8<n<-4$, $-4<n<2$, and $2<n\leq 11$ separately
If $n=2$, $n=-4$, or $n=-8$, then all three factors are 0
If $n>2$, then all three factors are positive
If $-4<n<2$, then $n-2$ is negative, while the other two factors are positive, so the product is negative
If $-8<n<-4$, then $n+8$ is positive, while the other two factors are negative, so the product is positive
If $n<-8$, then all three factors are negative, so the product is negative
In total, there are $\boxed{8}$ solutions: $-11,-10,-9,-3,-2,-1,0,1$.
First, consider the tangent line to the parabola at $(2,4).$  The equation of this tangent is of the form
\[y - 4 = m(x - 2).\]Setting $y = x^2,$ we get $x^2 - 4 = m(x - 2),$ or $x^2 - mx + 2m - 4 = 0.$  Since we have a tangent, $x = 2$ is a double root of this quadratic
In other words, this quadratic is identical to $(x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4.$  Hence, $m = 4.$
Let the center of the circle be $(a,b).$  The line joining the center $(a,b)$ and $(2,4)$ is the perpendicular to the tangent line, which means its slope is $-\frac{1}{4}.$  This gives us the equation
\[\frac{b - 4}{a - 2} = -\frac{1}{4}.\]Since the points $(2,4)$ and $(0,1)$ are on the circle, they must be equidistant from its center
The set of all points equidistant from $(2,4)$ and $(0,1)$ is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining $(2,4)$ and $(0,1)$
Therefore, the center of the circle must lie on the  perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining $(2,4)$ and $(0,1)$
The midpoint of this line segment is $\left( 1, \frac{5}{2} \right),$ and its slope is
\[\frac{4 - 1}{2 - 0} = \frac{3}{2}.\]Hence, $(a,b)$ must satisfy
\[\frac{b - 5/2}{a - 1} = -\frac{2}{3}.\]So,
\begin{align*}
b - 4 &= -\frac{1}{4} (a - 2), \\
b - \frac{5}{2} &= -\frac{2}{3} (a - 1).
\end{align*}Solving this system, we find $(a,b) = \boxed{\left( -\frac{16}{5}, \frac{53}{10} \right)}.$
Since the graph passes through the points $(-2,0)$ and $(4,0),$ the equation is of the form $a(x + 2)(x - 4).$
The graph has a maximum, and this maximum value occurs at the average of $-2$ and 4, namely $x = \frac{-2 + 4}{2} = 1.$  But $a + b + c$ is exactly the value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ at $x = 1,$ so $a + b + c = \boxed{54}.$
Let $(a,b)$ be the center of a circle that is tangent to $C_1$ and $C_2,$ and let $r$ be the radius.
unitsize(1 cm);
pair A, B, O, P, Q;
O = (0,0);
P = (2,0);
Q = (1,sqrt(21)/2);
A = intersectionpoint(O--Q,Circle(Q,1.5));
B = intersectionpoint(Q--interp(P,Q,2),Circle(Q,1.5));
draw(Circle(O,1));
draw(Circle(P,4));
draw(Circle(Q,1.5));
draw(O--Q);
draw(P--B);
label("$r$", (Q + A)/2, NW);
label("$r$", (Q + B)/2, SW);
label("$1$", (O + A)/2, NW);
label("$4 - r$", (P + Q)/2, NE, UnFill);
label("$C_1$", dir(225), dir(225));
label("$C_2$", P + 4*dir(70), dir(70));
dot("$(0,0)$", O, S);
dot("$(2,0)$", P, S);
dot(A);
dot(B);
dot("$(a,b)$", Q, NE);
[/asy]
Then the square of the distance of the center of this circle from the center of $C_1$ is $a^2 + b^2 = (r + 1)^2$ and the square of the distance of the center of this circle from the center of $C_2$ is $(a - 2)^2 + b^2 = (4 - r)^2.$  Subtracting these equations, we get
\[a^2 - (a - 2)^2 = (r + 1)^2 - (4 - r)^2.\]This simplifies to $4a - 4 = 10r - 15,$ so $r = \frac{4a + 11}{10}.$
Substituting into the equation $a^2 + b^2 = (r + 1)^2,$ we get
\[a^2 + b^2 = \left( \frac{4a + 21}{10} \right)^2.\]This simplifies to $\boxed{84a^2 + 100b^2 - 168a - 441 = 0}.$
If $r$ is a root of $f(x) = 0$, then $r^3+r^2+2r+3=0$
Rearranging, we have \[r^3+2r=-r^2-3,\]and squaring this equation gives \[r^6+4r^4+4r^2=r^4+6r^2+9,\]or \[r^6+3r^4-2r^2-9=0.\]Rewriting this equation in the form $(r^2)^3 + 3(r^2)^2 - 2r^2 - 9 =0$, we see that the polynomial $x^3+3x^2-2x-9$ has $r^2$ as a root, so three of its roots are the squares of the roots of $f(x)$
But this polynomial is cubic, so these are its only roots
Thus, $g(x)=x^3+3x^2-2x-9$, and so $(b,c,d) = \boxed{(3,-2,-9)}$.
Let $a = x - 1$ and $b = y - 1.$  Then $x = a + 1$ and $y = b + 1,$ so
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^2}{y - 1} + \frac{y^2}{x - 1} &= \frac{(a + 1)^2}{b} + \frac{(b + 1)^2}{a} \\
&= \frac{a^2 + 2a + 1}{b} + \frac{b^2 + 2b + 1}{a} \\
&= 2 \left( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} \right) + \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{b^2}{a} + \frac{1}{a}.
\end{align*}By AM-GM,
\[\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} \ge 2 \sqrt{\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{a}} = 2\]and
\[\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{b^2}{a} + \frac{1}{a} \ge 4 \sqrt[4]{\frac{a^2}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{b} \cdot \frac{b^2}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{a}} = 4,\]so
\[2 \left( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} \right) + \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{b^2}{a} + \frac{1}{a} \ge 2 \cdot 2 + 4 = 8.\]Equality occurs when $a = b = 1,$ or $x = y = 2,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{8}.$
Let $u_4 = a.$  Then $u_5 = 2u_4 + u_3 = 2a + 9$ and $u_6 = 2u_5 + u_4 = 2(2a + 9) + a = 5a + 18 = 128.$  Solving for $a,$ we find $a = 22,$ so $u_5 = 2 \cdot 22 + 9 = \boxed{53}.$
By Vieta's formulas,
\begin{align*}
a + b + c &= 0, \\
ab + ac + bc &= -1, \\
abc &= 1.
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
a(b - c)^2 + b(c - a)^2 + c(a - b)^2 &= a(b^2 - 2bc + c^2) + b(c^2 - 2ac + a^2) + c(a^2 - 2ab + b^2) \\
&= (ab^2 - 2abc + ac^2) + (bc^2 - 2abc + ba^2) + (ca^2 - 2abc + cb^2) \\
&= (ab^2 - 2 + ac^2) + (bc^2 - 2 + ba^2) + (ca^2 - 2 + cb^2) \\
&= ab^2 + ac^2 + bc^2 + ba^2 + ca^2 + cb^2 - 6 \\
&= a^2 (b + c) + b^2 (a + c) + c^2 (a + b) - 6.
\end{align*}From $a + b + c = 0,$ $b + c = -a.$  Simillarly, $a + c = -b$ and $a + b = -c,$ so
\[a^2 (b + c) + b^2 (a + c) + c^2 (a + b) - 6 = -a^3 - b^3 - c^3 - 6.\]Since $a$ is a root of $x^3 - x - 1 = 0,$ $a^3 - a - 1 = 0,$ so $-a^3 = -a - 1.$  Similarly, $-b^3 = -b - 1$ and $-c^3 = -c - 1,$ so
\begin{align*}
-a^3 - b^3 - c^3 - 6 &= (-a - 1) + (-b - 1) + (-c - 1) - 6 \\
&= -(a + b + c) - 9 \\
&= \boxed{-9}.
\end{align*}
Since $f \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $f \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = \left\lfloor -\frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor + \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{1}{2},$ so if $f$ is either even or odd, it must be odd.
But $f(0) = \lfloor 0 \rfloor + \frac{1}{2}.$  Every odd function $f(x)$ satisfies $f(0) = 0,$ so $f(x)$ is $\boxed{\text{neither}}.$
Let $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of $z$, respectively
Then $\bar{z}=a-bi$, so that $-3\bar{z}=-3a+3ib$
We now find that \[2z-3\bar{z} = (2a-3a) + (2b +3b)i
\]So if $2z-3\bar{z}=-2-30i$ then we must have $2a-3a=-2$ and $2b+3b=-30$
This immediately gives us $a=2$ and $b=-6$
Therefore the complex number we are seeking is $z=\boxed{2-6i}$.
We have $f(n) = m$ if and only if \[m - \frac{1}{2} < \sqrt[4]{n} < m + \frac{1}{2},\]or \[\left(m - \frac{1}{2}\right)^4 < n < \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right)^4.\]Expanding the fourth powers, we get \[m^4 - 2m^3 + \frac{3}{2}m^2 - \frac{1}{2}m + \frac{1}{16} < n < m^4+ 2m^3 + \frac{3}{2}m^2 + \frac{1}{2}m + \frac{1}{16}.\]The leftmost and rightmost expressions are both non-integers, and their difference is $4m^3 + m$
Therefore, there are exactly $4m^3 + m$ values of $n$ that satisfy this inequality.
For each $m$, there are $4m^3 + m$ terms of the form $\frac{1}{m}$ in the sum, so those terms contribute $(4m^3+m) \cdot \frac{1}{m} = 4m^2 + 1$ to the sum
Thus, from $m=1$ to $m=6$, we get $4(1+4+9+16+25+36) + 6 = 370$.
The remaining terms have $m=7$
Since $6.5^4 = 1785 \frac{1}{16}$, these are the terms from $n=1786$ to $n=1995$, inclusive
There are $1995 - 1786 + 1 = 210$ such terms, so they contribute $210 \cdot \frac{1}{7} = 30$ to the sum
Therefore, the final answer is $370 + 30 = \boxed{400}$.
Expanding $f(f(x)) = f(x)$ gives us $$(x^2-3x)^2-3(x^2-3x)=x^2-3x.$$Rather than expanding, we can subtract $x^2-3x$ from both sides to get $$(x^2-3x)^2-4(x^2-3x)=0.$$Factoring out $x^2-3x$ gives $(x^2-3x)(x^2-3x-4)=0$
Factoring each quadratic separately, we get $$x(x-3)(x+1)(x-4)=0.$$Thus the values of $x$ are $\boxed{0, 3, -1, 4}$.
We have that $q = -p^2 + 6p - 5,$ so by the Shoelace Theorem, the area of triangle $ABC$ is
\begin{align*}
&\frac{1}{2} |(1)(3) + (4)(-p^2 + 6p - 5) + (p)(0) - (0)(4) - (3)(p) - (-p^2 + 6p - 5)(1)| \\
&= \frac{1}{2} |-3p^2 + 15p - 12| \\
&= \frac{3}{2} |p^2 - 5p + 4| \\
&= \frac{3}{2} |(p - 1)(p - 4)|.
\end{align*}Since $1 \le p \le 4,$ $|(p - 1)(p - 4)| = (p - 1)(4 - p),$ so we want to maximize
\[\frac{3}{2} (p - 1)(4 - p).\]The maximum value occurs at $p = \frac{5}{2},$ so the maximum area is
\[\frac{3}{2} \left( \frac{5}{2} - 1 \right) \left( 4 - \frac{5}{2} \right) = \boxed{\frac{27}{8}}.\]
By the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are all the divisors of 11 (including negative divisors), so they are $\boxed{-11, -1, 1, 11}.$
Let the three roots be $r-d$, $r$, and $r+d$, for some complex numbers $r$ and $d$
Then Vieta's formulas give
$$(r-d)+r+(r+d)=6 \qquad\text{and}\qquad (r-d)r+(r-d)(r+d)+r(r+d)=21.$$Simplifying these equations, we have
$$3r=6 \qquad\text{and}\qquad 3r^2-d^2=21.$$From $3r=6$, we deduce $r=2$
Substituting this into our second equation gives $12-d^2=21$, so $d^2=-9$ and $d=\pm 3i$
Therefore, the roots of the cubic are $2-3i$, $2$, and $2+3i$, so
$$a = -2(2-3i)(2+3i) = -2\left(2^2-(3i)^2\right) = -2(4+9) = \boxed{-26}.$$
By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[(a + b + c + d + e + f) \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{4}{b} + \frac{9}{c} + \frac{16}{d} + \frac{25}{e} + \frac{36}{f} \right) \ge (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)^2 = 441,\]so
\[\frac{1}{a} + \frac{4}{b} + \frac{9}{c} + \frac{16}{d} + \frac{25}{e} + \frac{36}{f} \ge \frac{441}{7} = 63.\]Equality occurs when $a^2 = \frac{b^2}{4} = \frac{c^2}{9} = \frac{d^2}{16} = \frac{e^2}{25} = \frac{f^2}{36}$ and $a + b + c + d + e + f = 7.$  Solving, we find $a = \frac{1}{3},$ $b = \frac{2}{3},$ $c = 1,$ $d = \frac{4}{3},$ $e = \frac{5}{3},$ and $f = 2,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{63}.$
We have that $\omega^3 = 1.$  Then $\omega^3 - 1 = 0,$ which factors as $(\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0.$  Since $\omega$ is nonreal, $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,
\[\omega = -\frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i.\]Taking the conjugate of the given equation, we get
\[\frac{1}{a_1 + \overline{\omega}} + \frac{1}{a_2 + \overline{\omega}} + \dots + \frac{1}{a_n + \overline{\omega}} = 2 - 5i.\]Note that if $a$ is a real number, then
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{a + \omega} + \frac{1}{a + \overline{\omega}} &= \frac{a + \omega + a + \overline{\omega}}{(a + \omega)(a + \overline{\omega})} \\
&= \frac{2a + \omega + \overline{\omega}}{a^2 + (\omega + \overline{\omega}) a + \omega \overline{\omega}} \\
&= \frac{2a - 1}{a^2 - a + 1}.
\end{align*}Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{2a_k - 1}{a_k^2 - a_k + 1} &= \sum_{k = 1}^n \left( \frac{1}{a_k + \omega} + \frac{1}{a_k + \overline{\omega}} \right) \\
&= 2 + 5i + 2 - 5i \\
&= \boxed{4}.
\end{align*}
Expanding, we get $r^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{r^2} = 3,$ so
\[r^2 - 1 + \frac{1}{r^2} = 0.\]Then
\[r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} = \left( r + \frac{1}{r} \right) \left( r^2 - 1 + \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \boxed{0}.\]
Let $x = a - 5.$  Then $a = x + 5,$ so
\[(x + 5)^3 - 15(x + 5)^2 + 20(x + 5) - 50 = 0,\]which simplifies to $x^3 - 55x - 200 = 0.$
Let $y = b - \frac{5}{2}.$  Then $b = y + \frac{5}{2},$ so
\[8 \left( y + \frac{5}{2} \right)^3 - 60 \left( y + \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - 290 \left( y + \frac{5}{2} \right) + 2575 = 0,\]which simplifies to $y^3 - 55y + 200 = 0.$  (Note that through these substitutions, we made the quadratic term vanish in each of these cubic equations.)
Consider the function $f(t) = t^3 - 55t.$  Observe that the polynomial $f(t)$ has three roots 0, $\sqrt{55},$ and $-\sqrt{55}.$  Its graph is shown below.
unitsize (0.2 cm);
real cubic (real x) {
return ((x^3 - 55*x)/12);
draw(graph(cubic,-8.5,8.5));
draw((-18,0)--(18,0));
draw((0,-18)--(0,18));
dot("$\sqrt{55}$", (sqrt(55),0), SE);
dot("$-\sqrt{55}$", (-sqrt(55),0), SW);
[/asy]
Let $0 \le t \le \sqrt{55}.$  Then
\[[f(t)]^2 = (t^3 - 55t)^2 = t^2 (t^2 - 55)^2 = t^2 (55 - t^2)^2 = t^2 (55 - t^2)(55 - t^2).\]By AM-GM,
\[2t^2 (55 - t^2)(55 - t^2) \le \left( \frac{(2t^2) + (55 - t^2) + (55 - t^2)}{3} \right)^3 = \left( \frac{110}{3} \right)^3 < 40^3,\]so
\[[f(t)]^2 < 32000 < 32400,\]which means $|f(t)| < 180.$
Since $f(t)$ is an odd function, $|f(t)| < 180$ for $-\sqrt{55} \le t \le 0$ as well
This means that the equation $f(t) = 200$ has exactly one real root
Similarly, $f(t) = -200$ has exactly one real root
Furthermore, since $f(t)$ is an odd function, these roots add up to 0.
\[a - 5 + b - \frac{5}{2} = 0,\]so $a + b = 5 + \frac{5}{2} = \boxed{\frac{15}{2}}.$
We are given
\[f(x) + 2f \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = 3x.\]Replacing $x$ with $\frac{1}{x},$ we get
\[f \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) + 2f(x) = \frac{3}{x}.\]We can view these equations as a system in $f(x)$ and $f \left( \frac{1}{x} \right).$  Solving for $f(x),$ we find
\[f(x) = \frac{2 - x^2}{x}.\]Then the equation $f(x) = f(-x)$ becomes
\[\frac{2 - x^2}{x} = \frac{2 - x^2}{-x}.\]Then $2 - x^2 = x^2 - 2,$ so $x^2 = 2.$  The solutions are $\boxed{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}}.$
Since $p,q, r$ are roots of $ 30 x^3 - 50x^2 + 22x - 1$, $ {1-p},{1-q}, {1-r} $ are roots of $ 30 (1-x)^3 - 50(1-x)^2 + 22(1-x) - 1$.
If we consider only the constant terms in the expansion of the above polynomial, we find that the constant coefficient is $30 - 50 +22 -1 = 1$
Similarly, the linear coefficient of the above polynomial is $30(-3)+50(2)-22=-12$
Hence, $\frac{1}{1-p} , \frac{1}{1-q} ,\frac{1}{1-r} $ are the roots of a cubic in the reversed form $1x^3-12x^2+\dotsb$
Using Vieta's formula,
\[\frac{1}{1-p} + \frac{1}{1-q} +\frac{1}{1-r} = - \frac{-12}{1} = \boxed{12}.\]
The left-hand side, when multiplied out, is a polynomial of degree $6.$ By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is determined by its $x^6$ coefficient and its constant term
The $x^6$ coefficient is $2 \cdot 5 = 10$ and the constant term is $20 \cdot 19 = 380,$ so the product of the roots is $\tfrac{380}{10} = \boxed{38}.$
Since the polynomial has no constant term, we can immediately factor out an $x$ from every term
$$x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20),$$and our first root $x=0$
Let $g(x) = 6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$
Then the remaining roots of our original polynomial are the roots of $g(x)$
By trying out simple values, we can see that $g(0) = 20 > 0$ and $g(1) = 6+19-51+20 = -6<0$
Thus, there must be a root of $g(x)$ between $0$ and $1$
From the Rational Root Theorem, we know that if $g(p/q) = 0$ then $p$ must divide $20$ and $q$ must divide $6$.
Checking rational numbers of the form $p/q$, where $p$ divides $20$ and $q$ divides $6$, and $p/q$ is between $0$ and $1$, we find that
$$\begin{aligned} g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) &= 6\cdot\frac{1}{8}+19\cdot\frac{1}{4}-51\cdot\frac{1}{2}+20 = 0.
\end{aligned}$$This means that $2x - 1$ is a factor of $g(x).$ Dividing by $2x-1$ gives us $g(x) = (2x-1)(3x^2+11x-20)$.
The quadratic $3x^2+11x-20$ factors as $(3x-4)(x+5),$ so our last two roots are $4/3$ and $-5$.
Thus, the roots of $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ are $\boxed{0, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{4}{3}, -5}$.
Note that $x_i < 1$ for all $i.$
We claim that
\[\frac{x}{1 - x^2} \ge \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{2} x^2\]for all $0 < x < 1.$  This is equivalent to $2x \ge 3 \sqrt{3} x^2 (1 - x^2) = 3x^2 \sqrt{3} - 3x^4 \sqrt{3},$ or
\[3 \sqrt{3} x^4 - 3x^2 \sqrt{3} + 2x \ge 0.\]We can factor this as
\[x (x \sqrt{3} - 1)^2 (x \sqrt{3} + 2) \ge 0,\]which clearly holds
\[\frac{x}{1 - x^2} \ge \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{2} x^2.\]It follows that
\[\frac{x_1}{1 - x_1^2} + \frac{x_2}{1 - x_2^2} + \frac{x_3}{1 - x_3^2} + \dots + \frac{x_{100}}{1 - x_{100}^2} \ge \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{2} (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + \dots + x_{100}^2) = \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{2}.\]Equality occurs when $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ and $x_4 = x_5 = \dots = x_{100} = 0,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{\frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{2}}.$
We are asked to find  \[
\frac{2}{1\cdot3}+\frac{2}{2\cdot4}
+\frac{2}{3\cdot5}
+\frac{2}{4\cdot6}+\cdots+\frac{2}{2009\cdot2011}.
\] Observe that $\frac{2}{n(n+2)}$ may be written as $\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+2}$
Applying this identity, our sum becomes \[
\frac{1}{1}-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}
+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{5}
+\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{6}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2009}-\frac{1}{2011}.
\] Every negative term cancels with the term three places to the right
The only terms which remain are \[
1+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2010}-\frac{1}{2011}.
\] To the nearest thousandth, the sum is $\boxed{1.499}$.
Let $k = 2x^2 + 3xy + 2y^2.$  Then
\[2x^2 + 3xy + 2y^2 = k = k(4x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2) = 4kx^2 + 8kxy + 5ky^2 = 0,\]so $(4k - 2) x^2 + (8k - 3) xy + (5k - 2) y^2 = 0.$
If $y = 0,$ then $4x^2 = 1,$ so
\[2x^2 + 3xy + 2y^2 = \frac{1}{2}.\]Otherwise, we can divide both sides of $(4k - 2) x^2 + (8k - 3) xy + (5k - 2) y^2 = 0$ by $y^2,$ to get
\[(4k - 2) \left( \frac{x}{y} \right)^2 + (8k - 3) \frac{x}{y} + (5k - 2) = 0.\]This is a quadratic in $\frac{x}{y},$ so and its discriminant must be nonnegative:
\[(8k - 3)^2 - 4 (4k - 2)(5k - 2) \ge 0.\]This simplifies to $-16k^2 + 24k - 7 \ge 0,$ or $16k^2 - 24k + 7 \le 0.$  The roots of the quadratic $16k^2 - 24k + 7 = 0$ are $\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{2}}{4},$ so the solution to $16k^2 - 24k + 7 \le 0$ is
\[\frac{3 - \sqrt{2}}{4} \le k \le \frac{3 + \sqrt{2}}{4}.\]For any value of $k$ in this interval, we can take $x = ky,$ then substitute into $4x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2 = 1,$ and obtain solutions in $x$ and $y.$  Thus, $m = \frac{3 - \sqrt{2}}{4}$ and $M = \frac{3 + \sqrt{2}}{4},$ so $mM = \boxed{\frac{7}{16}}.$
The graph of $y = \frac{1}{2} f(x)$ is produced by taking the graph of $y = f(x)$ and compressing it vertically by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}.$  We then get the graph of $y = \frac{1}{2} f(x) + 3$ by shifting upward by three units
The correct graph is $\boxed{\text{C}}.$
Though it is possible to solve this problem using polynomial long division, it is quicker to use the Factor Theorem.
Let $f(x) = cx^3 + 19x^2 - 3cx + 35$
If $x+7$ is a factor of $f(x)$, the factor theorem tells us that $f(-7) = 0.$  Then
\[c(-7)^3 + 19(-7)^2 - 3c(-7) + 35 = 0,\]which simplifies to $-322c + 966 = 0.$  We can solve for $c$ to get $c = \boxed{3}$.
If $x$ is a solution, then $-x$ is a also a solution
Thus, we can pair all the solutions, and their sum is $\boxed{0}.$
Let $f(x) = 2^{|x|} + 3|x|.$  Since $f(0) = 0$ and $f(4) = 28,$ the equation $f(x) = 18$ has at least one solution in the interval $0 \le x \le 4.$  This ensures that the sum that the problem asks for is not an "empty" sum.
We can directly compute
\[\left(\frac34 + \frac34i\right)z = \left(\frac34 + \frac34i\right)(x + iy) = \frac{3(x-y)}4 + \frac{3(x+y)}4 \cdot i.\]This number is in $S$ if and only if $-1 \leq \frac{3(x-y)}4 \leq 1$ and at the same time $-1 \leq \frac{3(x+y)}4 \leq 1$
This simplifies to $|x-y|\leq\frac 43$ and $|x+y|\leq\frac 43$.
Let $T = \{ x + iy : |x-y|\leq\frac 43 \ \text{and} \ |x+y|\leq\frac 43 \}$, and let $[X]$ denote the area of the region $X$
Then, the probability we seek is $\frac {[S\cap T]}{[S]} = \frac{[S\cap T]}4$
All we need to do is to compute the area of the intersection of $S$ and $T$
It is easiest to do this graphically:
unitsize(2cm);
defaultpen(0.8);
path s = (-1,-1) -- (-1,1) -- (1,1) -- (1,-1) -- cycle;
path t = (4/3,0) -- (0,4/3) -- (-4/3,0) -- (0,-4/3) -- cycle;
path s_cap_t = (1/3,1) -- (1,1/3) -- (1,-1/3) -- (1/3,-1) -- (-1/3,-1) -- (-1,-1/3) -- (-1,1/3) -- (-1/3,1) -- cycle;
filldraw(s, lightred, black);
filldraw(t, lightgreen, black);
filldraw(s_cap_t, lightyellow, black);
draw( (-5/3,0) -- (5/3,0), dashed );
draw( (0,-5/3) -- (0,5/3), dashed );
[/asy]
Coordinate axes are dashed, $S$ is shown in red, $T$ in green and their intersection is yellow
The intersections of the boundary of $S$ and $T$ are obviously at $(\pm 1,\pm 1/3)$ and at $(\pm 1/3,\pm 1)$.
Hence, each of the four red triangles is an isosceles right triangle with legs of length $\frac 23$, and the area of a single red triangle is $\frac 12 \cdot \left( \frac 23 \right)^2 = \frac 29$
Then, the area of all four is $\frac 89$, and therefore the area of $S\cap T$ is $4 - \frac 89$
Thus, the probability we seek is $\frac{ [S\cap T]}4 = \frac{ 4 - \frac 89 }4 = 1 - \frac 29 = \boxed{\frac 79}$.
Recall that a parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus $F$ and the directrix
Completing the square on $x,$ we get
\[y = \frac{1}{12} (x - 3)^2 - \frac{1}{3}.\]To make the algebra a bit easier, we can find the directrix of the parabola $y = \frac{1}{12} x^2,$ shift the parabola right by 3 units to get $y = \frac{1}{12} (x - 3)^2$ (which does not change the directrix), and then shift it downward $\frac{1}{3}$ units to find the directrix of the parabola $y = \frac{1}{12} (x - 3)^2 - \frac{1}{3}.$
Since the parabola $y = \frac{1}{12} x^2$ is symmetric about the $y$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(0,f).$  Let $y = d$ be the equation of the directrix.

Let $\left( x, \frac{1}{12} x^2 \right)$ be a point on the parabola $y = \frac{1}{12} x^2.$  Then
\[PF^2 = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{12} x^2 - f \right)^2\]and $PQ^2 = \left( \frac{1}{12} x^2 - d \right)^2.$  Thus,
\[x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{12} x^2 - f \right)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{12} x^2 - d \right)^2.\]Expanding, we get
\[x^2 + \frac{1}{144} x^4 - \frac{f}{6} x^2 + f^2 = \frac{1}{144} x^4 - \frac{d}{6} x^2 + d^2.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
1 - \frac{f}{6} &= -\frac{d}{6}, \\
f^2 &= d^2.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $f - d = 6.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $-2d = 6,$ so $d = -3.$
Thus, the equation of the directrix of $y = \frac{1}{12} x^2$ is $y = -3,$ so the equation of the directrix of $y = \frac{1}{12} (x - 3)^2 - \frac{1}{3}$ is $\boxed{y = -\frac{10}{3}}.$
Since we can take the cube root of any real number (positive or negative), $z(x) = \sqrt[3]{x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{8 - x}$ is defined for all real numbers $x.$  Thus, the domain of $z(x)$ is $\boxed{(-\infty,\infty)}.$
We first unpack the statement $x < -4$ or $|x- 25 | \le 1.$ The inequality $|x-25| \le 1$ is equivalent to $-1 \le x-25 \le 1,$ which is in turn equivalent to $24 \le x \le 26.$ Therefore, we have either $x < -4$ or $24 \le x \le 26,$ so the solution set for $x$ is \[(-\infty, -4) \cup [24, 26].\]The sign of the expression $\frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{x-c}$ changes at $x = a,$ $x = b,$ and $x = c,$ which means that $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ must be the numbers $-4,$ $24,$ and $26,$ in some order
Furthermore, since $24$ and $26$ are endpoints of a closed interval (that is, they are included in the solution set), it must be the case that $a$ and $b$ are $24$ and $26$ in some order, because the inequality is true when $x=a$ or $x=b,$ but is not true when $x=c$ (since that would make the denominator zero)
Since $a < b,$ we have $a = 24$ and $b = 26,$ and then $c = -4.$
In conclusion, the given inequality must be \[\frac{(x-24)(x-26)}{x+4} \le 0.\]To check that the solution to this inequality is $(-\infty, -4) \cup [24, 26],$ we can build a sign table, where $f(x)$ is the expression on the left-hand side:  \begin{tabular}{c|ccc|c} &$x-24$ &$x-26$ &$x+4$ &$f(x)$ \\ \hline$x<-4$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$-4<x<24$ &$-$&$-$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$24<x<26$ &$+$&$-$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$x>26$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]\end{tabular}This shows that $f(x) < 0$ when $x \in (-\infty, -4) \cup (24, 26),$ and since $f(x) = 0$ for $x \in \{24, 26\},$ we indeed have the solution set \[x \in (-\infty, -4) \cup [24, 26].\]Thus, $a+2b+3c=24+2(26) + 3(-4) = \boxed{64}.$

\]Since $\deg d > \deg (4x+1)$ we cannot divide any further
So, $q(x) = 4x^2-1$ and $r(x)=4x+1$
$$q(1)+r(-1) = 4(1)^2+1+4(-1)-1=\boxed{0}.$$
The roots of the quadratic are $-3$ and 5, so
\[y = -x^2 + ax + b = -(x + 3)(x - 5) = -x^2 + 2x + 15 = -(x - 1)^2 + 16.\]Thus, the vertex is $\boxed{(1,16)}.$
Let the two numbers be $a$ and $b.$  Then $\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{3},$ so $ab = 3.$  Also,
\[\frac{2}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}} = \frac{2ab}{a + b} = \frac{3}{2},\]so $a + b = \frac{4}{3} ab = 4.$
Then by Vieta's formulas, $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic
\[x^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3),\]so the two numbers are $\boxed{1,3}.$
If $x \ge 0,$ then $f(|x|) = f(x).$  And if $x < 0,$ then $f(|x|) = f(-x).$  Thus, the graph of $y = |f(x)|$ is obtained by taking the part of the graph of $y = f(x)$ that is to the right of the $y$-axis, and making a copy by reflecting it across the $y$-axis
The correct graph is $\boxed{\text{A}}.$
Note that
\[\frac{1}{16}f(2x)=x^4+7x^3+13x^2+7x+1.\]Because the coefficients of this polynomial are symmetric, if $r$ is a root of $f(x)$ then $\frac{4}{r}$ is as well
Further, $f(-1)=-1$ and $f(-2)=16$ so $f(x)$ has two distinct roots on $(-2,0)$ and two more roots on $(-\infty,-2)$
Now, if $\sigma$ is a permutation of $\{1,2,3,4\}$:
\[|z_{\sigma(1)} z_{\sigma(2)} + z_{\sigma(3)} z_{\sigma(4)}| \le \frac{1}{2} (z_{\sigma(1)} z_{\sigma(2)} + z_{\sigma(3)} z_{\sigma(4)} + z_{\sigma(4)} z_{\sigma(3)} + z_{\sigma(2)}z_{\sigma(1)}).\]Let the roots be ordered $z_1 \le z_2 \le z_3 \le z_4$, then by rearrangement the last expression is at least:
\[\frac{1}{2}(z_1z_4+z_2z_3+z_3z_2+z_4z_1).\]Since the roots come in pairs $z_1z_4=z_2z_3=4$, our expression is minimized when $\sigma(1)=1,\sigma(2)=4,\sigma(3)=3,\sigma(4)=2$ and its minimum value is $\boxed{8}$.
For $1 \le a \le 7,$ we give a value of $x$ for which $x^4 + a^2$ is prime:
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
a & x & a^4 + x^2 \\ \hline
1 & 1 & 2 \\
2 & 1 & 5 \\
3 & 10 & 10009 \\
4 & 1 & 17 \\
5 & 2 & 41 \\
6 & 1 & 37 \\
7 & 20 & 160049
\end{array}
\]For $a = 8,$
\begin{align*}
x^4 + a^2 &= x^4 + 64 \\
&= x^4 + 16x^2 + 64 - 16x^2 \\
&= (x^2 + 8)^2 - (4x)^2 \\
&= (x^2 + 4x + 8)(x^2 - 4x + 8).
\end{align*}For any positive integer, both factors $x^2 + 4x + 8$ and $x^2 - 4x + 8$ are greater than 1, so $x^4 + 64$ is always composite
Thus, the smallest such $a$ is $\boxed{8}.$
If $x$ satisfies $x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0,$ then
\begin{align*}
x^2 &= 2x + 1, \\
x^3 &= x(2x + 1) = 2x^2 + x = 2(2x + 1) + x = 5x + 2, \\
x^4 &= x(5x + 2) = 5x^2 + 2x = 5(2x + 1) + 2x = 12x + 5.
\end{align*}Hence,
\begin{align*}
5 \alpha^4 + 12 \beta^3 &= 5(12 \alpha + 5) + 12 (5 \beta + 2) \\
&= 60 \alpha + 25 + 60 \beta + 24 \\
&= 60 (\alpha + \beta) + 49 \\
&= 60 \cdot 2 + 49 \\
&= \boxed{169}.
\end{align*}
Since the vertex is $(p,p),$ the parabola is of the form
\[y = a(x - p)^2 + p.\]Setting $x = 0,$ we get $y = ap^2 + p = -p,$ so $a = -\frac{2}{p}.$  Then
\[y = -\frac{2}{p} (x^2 - 2px + p^2) + p = -\frac{2}{p} x^2 + 4x - p,\]so $b = \boxed{4}.$
Note that
\begin{align*}
f(x) + f(1 - x) &= \frac{3}{9^x + 3} + \frac{3}{9^{1 - x} + 3} \\
&= \frac{3}{9^x + 3} + \frac{3 \cdot 9^x}{9 + 3 \cdot 9^x} \\
&= \frac{3}{9^x + 3} + \frac{9^x}{3 + 9^x} \\
&= \frac{3 + 9^x}{9^x + 3} \\
\end{align*}Thus, we can pair the 1000 terms in the sum into 500 pairs, such that the sum of the terms in each pair is 1
Therefore, the sum is equal to $\boxed{500}.$
If we graph $y = x^2 - (k - 3) x - k + 6,$ then we obtain an upward-facing parabola
Thus, the inequality
\[x^2 - (k - 3) x - k + 6 > 0\]holds as long as the discriminant of the quadratic is negative.
This gives us
\[(k - 3)^2 - 4(-k + 6) < 0.\]This simplifies to $k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0,$ which factors as $(k + 3)(k - 5) < 0.$  Thus, $k \in \boxed{(-3,5)}.$
Let $g : A \to A$ be defined by $g(x) := 1-1/x$; the key property is that \[
g(g(g(x))) = 1-\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{x}}} = x.
\]The given equation rewrites as $f(x) + f(g(x)) = \log|x|$
Substituting $x=g(y)$ and $x=g(g(z))$ gives the further equations $f(g(y)) + f(g) g(y)) = \log|g(x)|$ and $f(g) g(z)) + f(z) = \log|g(g(x))|.$ Setting $y$ and $z$ to $x$ and solving the system of three equations for $f(x)$ gives \[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left (\log|x| - \log|g(x)| + \log|g(g(x))| \right).
\]For $x=2007$, we have $g(x) = \frac{2006}{2007}$ and $g(g(x)) = \frac{-1}{2006}$, so that \[
f(2007) = \frac{\log|2007| - \log\left|\frac{2006}{2007}\right| + \log\left|\frac{-1}{2006}\right|}{2} = \boxed{\log\left(\frac{2007}{2006}\right)}.
Let $p(x)$ be the given polynomial
Notice that \[p(1) = 1 + (2a) + (2a-2) - (4a+3) - 2 = 0,\]so $1$ is a root of $p(x).$ Performing polynomial division, we then have \[p(x) = (x-1)(x^3+(2a+1)x^2+(4a-1)x+2).\]Notice that \[p(-2) = 1 \cdot (-8 + 4(2a+1) - 2(4a-1) + 2) = 0,\]so $-2$ is a root of $p(x)$ as well
Dividing the cubic term by $x+2,$ we then have \[p(x) = (x-1)(x+2)(x^2+(2a-1)x+1).\]Therefore, we want to find the probability that the roots of $x^2 + (2a-1)x + 1$ are all real
This occurs if and only if the discriminant is nonnegative: \[(2a-1)^2 - 4 \ge 0,\]or $(2a-1)^2 \ge 4.$ Thus, either $2a-1 \ge 2$ or $2a-1 \le -2.$ The first inequality is equivalent to $a \ge \tfrac{3}{2},$ and the second is equivalent to $a \le -\tfrac{1}{2}.$ This shows that all values of $a$ except those in the interval $\left(-\tfrac12, \tfrac32\right)$ satisfy the condition
This interval has length $2,$ and the given interval $[-20, 18],$ which contains it completely, has length $18 - (-20) = 38,$ so the probability is \[1 - \frac{2}{38} = \boxed{\frac{18}{19}}.\]
Let $O = (0,0),$ $A = (3,4),$ $B = (6,8),$ and $C = (5,13).$  Let $T$ be a point on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC,$ so that $\overline{OT}$ is tangent to the circumcircle
Note that $O,$ $A,$ and $B$ are collinear.
unitsize(0.4 cm);
pair A, B, C, O, T;
A = (3,4);
B = (6,8);
C = (5,13);
O = circumcenter(A,B,C);
T = intersectionpoints(Circle(O/2,abs(O)/2),circumcircle(A,B,C))[1];
draw(circumcircle(A,B,C));
draw((0,0)--(6,8));
draw((0,0)--T);
draw((-10,0)--(10,0));
draw((0,-2)--(0,18));
label("$O = (0,0)$", (0,0), SW);
dot("$A = (3,4)$", A, SE);
dot("$B = (6,8)$", B, E);
dot("$C = (5,13)$", C, NE);
dot("$T$", T, SW);
[/asy]
Then by power of a point, $OT^2 = OA \cdot OB = 5 \cdot 10 = 50,$ so $OT = \sqrt{50} = \boxed{5 \sqrt{2}}.$
The given product can be rewritten in the form $(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$, which is the factorization of $a^3-b^3$ for $a=2x^3$ and $b=5y^2$
Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as $a^3-b^3=(2x^3)^3-(5y^2)^3=\boxed{8x^9-125y^6}$.
Combining the terms on the right-hand side, we have \[\frac{x^2}{x+1} \ge \frac{5x+3}{4(x-1)}.\]Then, moving all the terms to the left-hand side and combining denominators again, we get \[\begin{aligned} \frac{x^2}{x+1} - \frac{5x+3}{4(x-1)} &\ge 0 \\ \frac{4x^2(x-1)-(x+1)(5x+3)}{(x+1)(x-1)} &\ge 0 \\ \frac{4x^3-9x^2-8x-3}{(x+1)(x-1)} &\ge 0
\end{aligned}\]We try to factor the numerator
Using the rational root theorem to test for rational roots, we see that $x=3$ is a root of $4x^3-9x^2-8x-3.$ Then, doing the polynomial division gives \[4x^3-9x^2-8x-3 = (x-3)(4x^2+3x+1),\]so we have \[\frac{(x-3)(4x^2+3x+1)}{(x+1)(x-1)} \ge 0.\]Since $4x^2+3x+1$ has a positive $x^2$ coefficient, and its discriminant is $3^2 - 4 \cdot 4= -7,$ which is negative, it follows that $4x^2 + 3x + 1 > 0$ for all $x.$ Thus, the above inequality is equivalent to \[f(x) = \frac{x-3}{(x+1)(x-1)} \ge 0.\]We make a sign table for $f(x)$: \begin{tabular}{c|ccc|c} &$x-3$ &$x+1$ &$x-1$ &$f(x)$ \\ \hline$x<-1$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$-1<x<1$ &$-$&$+$&$-$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$1<x<3$ &$-$&$+$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$x>3$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]\end{tabular}We see that $f(x) > 0$ when $-1 < x < 1$ or $x > 3.$ Since the inequality is nonstrict, we also include the values of $x$ such that $f(x) = 0,$ that is, only $x = 3.$ Therefore, the solution to the inequality is \[x \in \boxed{(-1, 1) \cup [3, \infty)}.\]
Moving all the terms to the left-hand side, we have \[\frac{1}{x+1} + \frac{3}{x+7} -\frac23 \ge 0.\]To solve this inequality, we find a common denominator: \[\frac{3(x+7) + 3 \cdot 3(x+1) - 2(x+1)(x+7)}{3(x+1)(x+7)} \ge 0,\]which simplifies to \[-\frac{2(x+4)(x-2)}{3(x+1)(x+7)} \ge 0.\]Therefore, we want the values of $x$ such that \[f(x) = \frac{(x+4)(x-2)}{(x+1)(x+7)} \le 0.\]To do this, we make the following sign table: \begin{tabular}{c|cccc|c} &$x+4$ &$x-2$ &$x+1$ &$x+7$ &$f(x)$ \\ \hline$x<-7$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$-7<x<-4$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$-4<x<-1$ &$+$&$-$&$-$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$-1<x<2$ &$+$&$-$&$+$&$+$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$x>2$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]\end{tabular}Because the inequality $f(x) \le 0$ is nonstrict, we must also include the values of $x$ such that $f(x) = 0,$ which are $x=-4$ and $x=2.$ Putting it all together, the solutions to the inequality are \[x \in \boxed{(-7, -4] \cup (-1, 2]}.\]
We have that
\begin{align*}
f(-x) &= \frac{1}{2^{-x} - 1} + \frac{1}{2} \\
&= \frac{2^x}{1 - 2^x} + \frac{1}{2} \\
&= \frac{1 - (1 - 2^x)}{1 - 2^x} + \frac{1}{2} \\
&= \frac{1}{1 - 2^x} - 1 + \frac{1}{2} \\
&= \frac{1}{1 - 2^x} - \frac{1}{2} \\
&= -\frac{1}{2^x - 1} - \frac{1}{2} \\
&= -f(x),
\end{align*}so $f(x)$ is an $\boxed{\text{odd}}$ function.
We have that $2a = 6,$ so $a = 3.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 4,$ so $c = 2.$  Hence, $b = \sqrt{a^2 - c^2} = \sqrt{5}.$
The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(2,1).$  Thus, the equation of the ellipse is
\[\frac{(x - 2)^2}{3^2} + \frac{(y - 1)^2}{(\sqrt{5})^2} = 1.\]Hence, $h + k + a + b = 2 + 1 + 3 + \sqrt{5} = \boxed{6 + \sqrt{5}}.$
By Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots is equal to 0, or $a+b+c=0$
Therefore, $\frac{a+b+c}{3}=0$
Since the centroid of any triangle is the average of its vertices, the centroid of this triangle is the origin.
Without loss of generality, let the right angle be at $b.$  Let $x = |b - c|$ and $y = |a - b|.$  The magnitudes of $a$, $b$, and $c$ are just $\frac{2}{3}$ of the medians because the origin, or the centroid in this case, cuts the median in a ratio of $2:1$.
Hence,
\[|a|^2=\frac{4}{9}\cdot \left( \left(\frac{x}{2} \right)^2+y^2 \right)=\frac{x^2}{9}+\frac{4y^2}{9}\]because $|a|$ is two thirds of the median from $a$
Similarly,
\[|c|^2=\frac{4}{9}\cdot \left(x^2 + \left( \frac{y}{2} \right)^2 \right)=\frac{4x^2}{9}+\frac{y^2}{9}.\]Furthermore,
\[|b|^2=\frac{4}{9}\cdot\frac{x^2+y^2}{4}=\frac{x^2}{9}+\frac{y^2}{9}.\]Hence,
\[|a|^2+|b|^2+|c|^2=\frac{6x^2+6y^2}{9}=\frac{2x^2+2y^2}{3}=250.\]Thus, $h^2=x^2+y^2=\frac{3}{2}\cdot 250=\boxed{375}.$
The graph of $y = f(x + 2)$ is produced by taking the graph of $y = f(x)$ and shifting two units to the left
The correct graph is $\boxed{\text{E}}.$
We have \[\begin{aligned} (a+bi)^3 - 107i &= (a^3 + 3a^2bi - 3ab^2 - b^3i) - 107i \\ &=(a^3 - 3ab^2) + (3a^2b-b^3-107)i
\end{aligned}\]If this is a real number, then we must have \[0 = 3a^2b-b^3-107\]or \[107 = b(3a^2-b^2).\]Since $107$ is prime, either $b=1$ or $b=107.$ If $b=1,$ then we have $107 = 3a^2-1,$ so $a^2 = 36$ and $a=6.$ If $b = 107,$ then we have $1 = 3a^2 - 107^2,$ so $a^2 = \frac{1 + 107^2}{3}.$ But $107^2 \equiv 2^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3},$ so the right-hand side is not an integer
Thus, $(a, b) = (6, 1)$ is the only possibility
Then the answer is \[a^3 - 3ab^2 = 6^3-3 \cdot 6 \cdot 1^2 = \boxed{198}.\]
We consider both inequalities separately.
The left inequality is equivalent to
\[\frac{x^2 - 14x + 11}{x^2 - 2x + 3} + 1 > 0,\]or
\[\frac{2x^2 - 16x + 14}{x^2 - 2x + 3} > 0.\]Then
\[\frac{x^2 - 8x + 7}{x^2 - 2x + 3} > 0.\]The numerator factors as
\[\frac{(x - 1)(x - 7)}{x^2 - 2x + 3} > 0.\]The denominator $x^2 - 2x + 3 = (x - 1)^2 + 2$ is always positive.
The quadratic $(x - 1)(x - 7)$ is positive precisely when $x < 1$ or $x > 7.$
The right inequality is equivalent to
\[1 - \frac{x^2 - 14x + 11}{x^2 - 2x + 3} > 0,\]or
\[\frac{12x - 8}{x^2 - 2x + 3} > 0.\]Then
\[\frac{3x - 2}{x^2 - 2x + 3} > 0.\]Since the denominator is always positive, this inequality holds if and only if $x > \frac{2}{3}.$
The solution is then
\[x \in \boxed{\left( \frac{2}{3}, 1 \right) \cup (7,\infty)}.\]
By the Binomial Theorem,
\[(x + y)^{100} = \binom{100}{0} x^{100} + \binom{100}{1} x^{99} y + \binom{100}{2} x^{98} y^2 + \dots + \binom{100}{100} y^{100}.\]Setting $x = 1$ and $y = -1,$ we get
\[\binom{100}{0} - \binom{100}{1} + \binom{100}{2} - \dots + \binom{100}{100} = \boxed{0}.\]
We can factor the denominator to get $$f(x) = \frac{x^2-x+c}{(x-4)(x+5)}.$$Hence, the graph of $f(x)$ has vertical asymptotes at $x=-5$ and $x=4$, unless there is a factor of $x-4$ or $x+5$ in the numerator that cancels out the corresponding factor in the denominator (in this case there will be a hole at that point rather than an asymptote)
So, we need to find $c$ such that $x^2 - x + c$ has a factor of $x-4$ or $x + 5,$ but not both.
That is to say, we need $c$ such that either $4$ or $-5$ is a root
If $x = 4$ is a root, we must have $(4)^2-4+c=0$ which gives us $c=-12.$ If $-5$ is a root, then we must have $(-5)^2 - (-5) + c = 0,$ or $c = - 30.$
Thus, the values that work are $c = \boxed{-12 \text{ or } -30}.$
We have that
\[3 + \frac{3 + k}{4} + \frac{3 + 2k}{4^2} + \frac{3 + 3k}{4^3} + \dotsb = 8.\]Multiplying this equation by 4, we get
\[12 + (3 + k) + \frac{3 + 2k}{4} + \frac{3 + 3k}{4^2} + \dotsb = 32.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[12 + k + \frac{k}{4} + \frac{k}{4^2} + \frac{k}{4^3} + \dotsb = 24.\]Then
\[12 + \frac{k}{1 - 1/4} = 24.\]Solving for $k,$ we find $k = \boxed{9}.$
We rewrite the given equation as \[5^{a_{n+1} - a_n} = 1 + \frac{1}{n +\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{3n+5}{3n+2}.\]Then, we observe a telescoping product: \[\begin{aligned} 5^{a_n - a_1} &= 5^{a_2 - a_1} \cdot 5^{a_3-a_2} \cdots 5^{a_n - a_{n-1}} \\ &= \frac{8}{5} \cdot \frac{11}{8} \cdots \frac{3n+2}{3n-1} \\ &= \frac{3n+2}{5}
\end{aligned}\]Since $a_1 = 1$, we have \[5^{a_n} = 3n+2\]for all $n \ge 1$
Thus, $a_k$ is an integer if and only if $3k+2$ is a power of $5$
The next power of $5$ which is of the form $3k+2$ is $5^3 = 125$, which is $3(41) + 2$
Thus $k = \boxed{41}$.
Let $\omega$ satisfy $x^2 + x + 1 = 0,$ so $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0.$  Then $(\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = \omega^3 - 1 = 0,$ so $\omega^3 = 1.$  Also,
\begin{align*}
\omega^{10} + \omega^5 + 1 &= \omega^9 \cdot \omega + \omega^3 \cdot \omega^2 + 1 \\
&= \omega + \omega^2 + 1 \\
\end{align*}Therefore, $x^2 + x + 1$ is a factor of $x^{10} + x^5 + 1.$
To bring out this factorization, we can write
\begin{align*}
x^{10} + x^5 + 1 &= x^{10} - x + x^5 - x^2 + x^2 + x + 1 \\
&= x(x^9 - 1) + x^2 (x^3 - 1) + x^2 + x + 1 \\
&= x(x^3 - 1)(x^6 + x^3 + 1) + x^2 (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) + x^2 + x + 1 \\
&= x(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)(x^6 + x^3 + 1) + x^2 (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) + x^2 + x + 1 \\
&= \boxed{(x^2 + x + 1)(x^8 - x^7 + x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x + 1)}.
\end{align*}
Since $y = x$ is an axis of symmetry, if point $(a,b)$ lies on the graph, then so does $(b,a).$  Thus, the equation of the graph can also be written as
\[x = \frac{py + q}{ry + s}.\]Substituting $y = \frac{px + q}{rx + s},$ we get
\[x = \frac{p \cdot \frac{px + q}{rx + s} + q}{r \cdot \frac{px + q}{rx + s} + s} = \frac{p(px + q) + q(rx + s)}{r(px + q) + s(rx + s)}.\]Cross-multiplying, we get
\[x[r(px + q) + s(rx + s)] = p(px + q) + q(rx + s).\]Expanding, we get
\[(pr + rs) x^2 + (s^2 - p^2) x - (pq + qs) = 0.\]We can take out a factor of $p + s$:
\[(p + s)(rx^2 + (s - p) x - q) = 0.\]This equation must holds for all $x.$  Since $r \neq 0,$ the quadratic $rx^2 + (s - p) x - q$ cannot be 0 for all $x,$ so we must have $p + s = 0.$  The correct statement is $\boxed{\text{(C)}}.$
\[S = \frac{2 + 6}{4^{100}} + \frac{2 + 2 \cdot 6}{4^{99}} + \frac{2 + 3 \cdot 6}{4^{98}} + \dots + \frac{2 + 98 \cdot 6}{4^3} + \frac{2 + 99 \cdot 6}{4^2} + \frac{2 + 100 \cdot 6}{4}.\]Then
\[4S = \frac{2 + 6}{4^{99}} + \frac{2 + 2 \cdot 6}{4^{98}} + \frac{2 + 3 \cdot 6}{4^{97}} + \dots + \frac{2 + 98 \cdot 6}{4^2} + \frac{2 + 99 \cdot 6}{4} + \frac{2 + 100 \cdot 6}{1}.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[3S = 602 - \frac{6}{4} - \frac{6}{4^2} - \dots - \frac{6}{4^{98}} - \frac{6}{4^{99}} - \frac{8}{4^{100}}.\]From the formula for a geometric series,
\begin{align*}
\frac{6}{4} + \frac{6}{4^2} + \dots + \frac{6}{4^{98}} + \frac{6}{4^{99}} &= \frac{6}{4^{99}} (1 + 4 + \dots + 4^{97} + 4^{98}) \\
&= \frac{6}{4^{99}} \cdot \frac{4^{99} - 1}{4 - 1} \\
&= 2 \cdot \frac{4^{99} - 1}{4^{99}} \\
&= 2 - \frac{2}{4^{99}}.
\end{align*}Therefore,
\[3S = 602 - 2 + \frac{2}{4^{99}} - \frac{8}{4^{100}} = 602 - 2 + \frac{2}{4^{99}} - \frac{2}{4^{99}} = 600,\]so $S = \boxed{200}.$
By Vieta's formulas, $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are the roots of
\[x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 = 0.\]We can write this as $x^2 (x - 1) + (x - 1) = 0,$ or $(x - 1)(x^2 + 1) = 0.$  The roots are $\boxed{1,i,-i}.$
Setting $y = 1$ in the first equation, we get
\[x \, \Diamond \, 1 = x (1 \, \Diamond \, 1) = x.\]Then from the second equation,
\[x \, \Diamond \, x = x \, \Diamond \, 1 = x.\]Then from the first equation,
\[(xy) \, \Diamond \, y=x(y \, \Diamond \, y) = xy.\]Therefore,
\[19 \, \Diamond \, 98 = \left( \frac{19}{98} \cdot 98 \right) \, \Diamond \, 98 = \frac{19}{98} \cdot 98 = \boxed{19}.\]
We have that
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{a_{n + 1}} + \frac{1}{b_{n + 1}} &= \frac{1}{a_n + b_n + \sqrt{a_n^2 + b_n^2}} + \frac{1}{a_n + b_n - \sqrt{a_n^2 + b_n^2}} \\
&= \frac{a_n + b_n - \sqrt{a_n^2 + b_n^2} + a_n + b_n + \sqrt{a_n^2 + b_n^2}}{(a_n + b_n)^2 - (a_n^2 + b_n^2)} \\
&= \frac{2a_n + 2b_n}{2a_n b_n} \\
&= \frac{1}{a_n} + \frac{1}{b_n}.
\end{align*}Thus, $\frac{1}{a_n} + \frac{1}{b_n}$ is a constant, which means
\[\frac{1}{a_{2012}} + \frac{1}{b_{2012}} = \frac{1}{a_0} + \frac{1}{b_0} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.\]
Since we have a coefficient of $\sqrt{2},$ we can guess that the positive root is of the form $a + b \sqrt{2},$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers
So, let $x = a + b \sqrt{2}.$  Substituting, we get
\[(a + b \sqrt{2})^3 - 3(a + b \sqrt{2})^2 - (a + b \sqrt{2}) - \sqrt{2} = 0.\]This expands as
\[(a^3 + 3a^2 b \sqrt{2} + 6ab^2 + 2b^3 \sqrt{2}) - 3(a^2 + 2ab \sqrt{2} + 2b^2) - (a + b \sqrt{2}) - \sqrt{2} = 0,\]so
\[(a^3 + 6ab^2 - 3a^2 - 6b^2 - a) + (3a^2 b + 2b^3 - 6ab - b - 1) \sqrt{2} = 0.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
a^3 + 6ab^2 - 3a^2 - 6b^2 - a &= 0, \\
3a^2 b + 2b^3 - 6ab - b - 1 &= 0.
\end{align*}From the first equation,
\[6ab^2 - 6b^2 = -a^3 + 3a^2 + a,\]so
\[6b^2 (a - 1) = -(a^3 - 3a^2 - a).\]Thus, $a - 1$ divides $a^3 - 3a^2 - a.$  Since $a - 1$ divides $(a - 1)(a - 3)(a + 1) = a^3 - 3a^2 - a + 3,$ $a - 1$ divides 3
This means $a - 1$ can be $-3,$ $-1,$ 1, or 3, so $a$ is $-2$, 0, 2, or 4.
If $a = -2,$ then $b^2 = -1,$ which has no solutions.
If $a = 0,$ then $b^2 = 0,$ so $b = 0,$ which does not work.
If $a = 2,$ then $b^2 = 1,$ so $b = -1$ or $b = 1.$  Only $a = 2$ and $b = 1$ satisfy the second equation.
If $a = 4,$ then $b^2 = -\frac{2}{3},$ which has no solutions.
Therefore, $a = 2$ and $b = 1$ works, so $x = \boxed{2 + \sqrt{2}}.$
Since a parabola can be tangent to a given line in at most one point, the parabola must be tangent to all three lines $y = -11x - 37,$ $y = x - 1,$ and $y = 9x + 3.$  Thus, if $a$ is the leading coefficient of $p(x),$ then
\begin{align*}
p(x) - (-11x - 37) &= a(x - x_1)^2, \\
p(x) - (x - 1) &= a(x - x_2)^2, \\
p(x) - (9x + 3) &= a(x - x_3)^2.
\end{align*}Subtracting the first two equations, we get
\begin{align*}
12x + 36 &= a(x - x_1)^2 - a(x - x_2)^2 \\
&= a(x - x_1 + x - x_2)(x_2 - x_1) \\
&= 2a(x_2 - x_1) x + a(x_1^2 - x_2^2).
\end{align*}Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
2a(x_2 - x_1) &= 12, \\
a(x_1^2 - x_2^2) &= 36.
\end{align*}Dividing these equations, we get $-\frac{1}{2} (x_1 + x_2) = 3,$ so $x_1 + x_2 = -6.$
Subtracting other pairs of equations gives us $x_1 + x_3 = -4$ and $x_2 + x_3 = -1.$  Then $2x_1 + 2x_2 + 2x_3 = -11,$ so
\[x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = \boxed{-\frac{11}{2}}.\]
Setting $x = -f(y),$ we get
\[f(0) = -f(y) + y,\]so $f(y) = y - f(0)$ for all real numbers $x.$  Then the given functional equation becomes
\[f(x + y - f(0)) = x + y,\]or $x + y - f(0) - f(0) = x + y.$  Then $f(0) = 0,$ so $f(x) = x$ for all real numbers $x.$  This function does satisfy the given functional equation, giving us $\boxed{1}$ solution.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality,
\[(a \cos \theta + b \sin \theta)^2 \le (a^2 + b^2)(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta) = a^2 + b^2,\]so $a \cos \theta + b \sin \theta \le \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.$
If $a = b = 0,$ then $a \cos \theta + b \sin \theta = 0$ for all $\theta.$  Otherwise, $a^2 + b^2 > 0,$ and we can find an angle $\theta$ such that
\[\cos \theta = \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \sin \theta = \frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}},\]which makes $a \cos \theta + b \sin \theta = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.$  Thus, the maximum value is $\boxed{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}.$
The long division is shown below.
\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{x^2} & -4x & +(8 - k) & \\
\cline{2-6}
x^2 - 2x + k & x^4 & -6x^3 & +16x^2 & -25x & +10 \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{x^2} & -2x^3 & + kx^2 \\
\cline{2-4}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{0} & -4x^3 & +(16 - k)x^2   \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} &- 4x^3 & +8x^2 & - 4kx \\
\cline{3-5}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 0 & +(8 - k)x^2 & +(4k - 25)x   \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & +(8 - k)x^2 & +(2k - 16)x & +k(8 - k) \\
\cline{4-6}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 0 & +(2k - 9)x  & +(k^2 - 8k + 10) \\
\end{array}
\]Thus, the remainder is $(2k - 9)x + (k^2 - 8k + 10).$  We want this to be $x + a,$ so $2k - 9 = 1$ and $k^2 - 8k + 10 = a.$  Solving, we find $(k,a) = \boxed{(5,-5)}.$
Let $x = \sqrt{a + b + c - d}.$  Then $x^2 = a + b + c - d,$ so $d = a + b + c - x^2,$ and we can write
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 1 = a + b + c - x^2 + x.\]Then
\[a^2 - a + b^2 - b + c^2 - c + x^2 - x + 1 = 0.\]Completing the square in $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $x,$ we get
\[\left( a - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( b - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( c - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( x - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = 0.\]Hence, $a = b = c = x = \frac{1}{2},$ so
\[d = a + b + c - x^2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{\frac{5}{4}}.\]
We can write $9^{105} = (10 - 1)^{105}.$  Then by the Binomial Theorem,
\[(10 - 1)^{105} = 10^{105} - \binom{105}{1} 10^{104} + \binom{105}{2} 10^{103} - \dots + \binom{105}{102} 10^3 - \binom{105}{103} 10^2 + \binom{105}{104} 10 - 1.\]All the terms up to $\binom{105}{102} 10^3$ are divisible by $10^3,$ so for the purpose of finding the last three digits, we can ignore them
We are left with
\begin{align*}
-\binom{105}{103} 10^2 + \binom{105}{104} 10 - 1 &= -\binom{105}{2} 10^2 + \binom{105}{1} 10 - 1 \\
&= -\frac{105 \cdot 104}{2} \cdot 10^2 + 105 \cdot 10 - 1 \\
&= -546000 + 1050 - 1 \\
&= -546000 + 1049.
\end{align*}Hence, the last three digits are $\boxed{049}.$
We factor the denominator: \[n^4+4 = (n^2+2)^2-(2n)^2 = (n^2-2n+2)(n^2+2n+2).\]Now,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{n^4+3n^2+10n+10}{n^4+4} & = & 1 + \frac{3n^2+10n+6}{n^4+4} \\
& = & 1 + \frac{4}{n^2-2n+2} - \frac{1}{n^2+2n+2} \\
\Longrightarrow \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{n^4+3n^2+10n+10}{2^n \cdot \left(n^4+4\right)} & = & \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} + \frac{4}{2^n\cdot(n^2-2n+2)} - \frac{1}{2^n\cdot(n^2+2n+2)} \\
& = & \frac{1}{2} + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^{n-2}\cdot\left((n-1)^2+1\right)} - \frac{1}{2^n\cdot\left((n+1)^2+1\right)}
\end{eqnarray*}The last series telescopes to $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{10}$; thus, our our desired answer is $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{10} = \boxed{\frac{11}{10}}$.
Setting $x = y = 0,$ we get
\[f(f(0)) = 2f(0).\]Let $c = f(0),$ so $f(c) = 2c.$
Setting $x = 0$ and $y = c,$ we get
\[f(0) = f(0) + f(f(c) - c).\]Then $f(c) = 0,$ so $c = 0.$
Setting $x = 0,$ we get
\[f(-y) = f(f(y))\]for all $y.$
Setting $y = f(x),$ we get
\[0 = f(x) + f(f(f(x)) - f(-x)) + x.\]Since $f(f(x)) = f(-x),$ this becomes $f(x) = -x$ for all $x.$  We can check that this function works.
Thus, $n = 1$ and $s = -3,$ so $n \times s = \boxed{-3}.$
As the quotient of two perfect squares, the left-hand side is always nonnegative when it is defined
The left-hand side is defined whenever $x \neq 3,$ so the solution set is $\boxed{ (-\infty, 3) \cup (3, \infty) }.$
Combining denominators and simplifying,\[\frac{F(3x)}{F(x+3)} = \frac{9(x^2+5x+6)-48x-54}{x^2+5x+6} = \frac{9x^2 - 3x}{x^2 + 5x + 6}= \frac{3x(3x-1)}{(x+3)(x+2)}\]It becomes obvious that $F(x) = ax(x-1)$, for some constant $a$, matches the definition of the polynomial
To prove that $F(x)$ must have this form, note that\[(x+3)(x+2)F(3x) = 3x(3x-1)F(x+3)\]
Since $3x$ and $3x-1$ divides the right side of the equation, $3x$ and $3x-1$ divides the left side of the equation
Thus $3x(3x-1)$ divides $F(3x)$, so $x(x-1)$ divides $F(x)$.
It is easy to see that $F(x)$ is a quadratic, thus $F(x)=ax(x-1)$ as desired.
By the given, $F(6) = a(6)(5) = 15 \Longrightarrow a = \frac 12$
Thus, $F(12) = \frac{1}{2}(12)(11) = \boxed{66}$.
By definition, ${n\choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$
The ratio of the first two terms give us that\begin{align*}\frac{1}{2} &= \frac{\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}}{\frac{n!}{(k+1)!(n-k-1)!}} = \frac{k+1}{n-k}\\ 2&=n-3k\end{align*}The ratio of the second and third terms give us that\begin{align*}\frac{2}{3} &= \frac{\frac{n!}{(k+1)!(n-k-1)!}}{\frac{n!}{(k+2)!(n-k-2)!}} = \frac{k+2}{n-k-1}\\ 8&=2n-5k\end{align*}This is a linear system of two equations with two unknowns, indicating that there is a unique solution
Solving by substitution or multiplying the top equation and subtracting, we find $k = 4, n = 14$
Thus, $n+k=\boxed{18}$.
Rewriting the complex numbers in polar notation form, $1+i = \sqrt{2}\,\text{cis}\,\frac{\pi}{4}$ and $1-i = \sqrt{2}\,\text{cis}\,-\frac{\pi}{4}$, where $\text{cis}\,\theta = \cos \theta + i\sin \theta$
By De Moivre's Theorem,\begin{align*} \left(\sqrt{2}\,\text{cis}\,\frac{\pi}{4}\right)^{17} - \left(\sqrt{2}\,\text{cis}\,-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)^{17} &= 2^{17/2}\,\left(\text{cis}\,\frac{17\pi}{4}\right) - 2^{17/2}\,\left(\text{cis}\,-\frac{17\pi}{4}\right) \\ &= 2^{17/2}\left[\text{cis}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \text{cis}\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right] \\ &= 2^{17/2}\left(2i\sin \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \\ &= 2^{17/2} \cdot 2 \cdot 2^{-1/2}i = 2^9i = \boxed{512}\,i \end{align*}
Note that the value in the $r$th row and the $c$th column is given by $\left(\frac{1}{(2p)^r}\right)\left(\frac{1}{p^c}\right)$
We wish to evaluate the summation over all $r,c$, and so the summation will be, using the formula for an infinite geometric series:\begin{align*}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\sum_{c=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{(2p)^r}\right)\left(\frac{1}{p^c}\right) &= \left(\sum_{r=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2p)^r}\right)\left(\sum_{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{p^c}\right)\\ &= \left(\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{2p}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{p}}\right)\\ &= \frac{2p^2}{(2p-1)(p-1)}\end{align*}Taking the denominator with $p=2008$ (indeed, the answer is independent of the value of $p$), we have $m+n \equiv 2008^2 + (2008-1)(2\cdot 2008 - 1) \equiv (-1)(-1) \equiv 1 \pmod{2008}$ (or consider FOILing)
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
Multiply both sides by $x-1$; the right hand side collapses by the reverse of the difference of squares.
\begin{align*}(x-1)(x^{2^{2008}-1}-1)g(x) &= (x-1)(x+1)(x^2+1)(x^4+1)\cdots (x^{2^{2007}}+1) - (x-1)\\ &= (x^2-1) (x^2+1)(x^4+1)\cdots (x^{2^{2007}}+1) - (x-1)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= \left(x^{2^{2008}}-1\right) - (x-1) = x^{2^{2008}} - x \end{align*}Substituting $x = 2$, we have\[\left(2^{2^{2008}-1}-1\right) \cdot g(2) = 2^{2^{2008}}-2 = 2\left(2^{2^{2008}-1}-1\right)\]Dividing both sides by $2^{2^{2008}-1}$, we find $g(2) = \boxed{2}$.
Consider the polynomial\[f(x)=(x-1)^{2004}=\sum_{n=0}^{2004}\binom{2004}{n}\cdot(-1)^n x^{2004-n}.\]
Let $\omega^3=1$ with $\omega\neq 1$
We have
\begin{align*} \frac{f(1)+f(\omega)+f(\omega^2)}{3} &= \frac{(1-1)^{2004}+(\omega-1)^{2004}+(\omega^2-1)^{2004}}{3} \\ &= \frac{1}{3}\sum_{n=0}^{2004}\binom{2004}{n}\cdot(-1)^n\cdot(1^{2004-n}+\omega^{2004-n}+(\omega^2)^{2004-n}) \\ &= \sum_{n=0}^{668}(-1)^n \binom{2004}{3n}
\end{align*}
where the last step follows because $1^k+\omega^k+\omega^{2k}$ is 0 when $k$ is not divisible by 3, and $3$ when $k$ is divisible by 3.
We now compute $\frac{(1-1)^{2004}+(\omega-1)^{2004}+(\omega^2-1)^{2004}}{3}$
WLOG, let $\omega = \frac{-1+\sqrt{3}i}{2}, \omega^2=\frac{-1-\sqrt{3}i}{2}$
Then $\omega-1=\frac{-3+\sqrt{3}i}{2} = \sqrt{3}\cdot \frac{-\sqrt{3}+i}{2}$, and $\omega^2-1=\sqrt{3}\cdot\frac{-\sqrt{3}-i}{2}$
These numbers are both of the form $\sqrt{3}\cdot\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a 12th root of unity, so both of these, when raised to the 2004-th power, become $3^{1002}$
Thus, our desired sum becomes $2\cdot3^{1001}$.
To find $2\cdot3^{1001} \pmod{1000}$, we notice that $3^{\phi{500}}\equiv 3^{200}\equiv 1 \pmod{500}$ so that $3^{1001}\equiv 3 \pmod{500}$
Then $2\cdot3^{1001}=2(500k+3)=1000k+6$
Thus, our answer is $\boxed{6}$.
Let $a=\sqrt[3]{x}, b = \sqrt[3]{20-x}$
Then $a+b = 2$ and $a^3 + b^3 = 20$
Factoring,\[a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)((a+b)^2-3ab) = 2(4-3ab)= 8-6ab=20 \Longrightarrow ab = -2\]
Solving $a+b=2, ab=-2$ gives us the quadratic $a^2 - 2a - 2 = 0$
The quadratic formula yields $a = \frac{2 - \sqrt{12}}{2} = 1 - \sqrt{3}$, and $x = a^3 = (1-\sqrt{3})^3 = 1 - 3\sqrt{3} + 9 - 3\sqrt{3} = 10 - \sqrt{108}$
Therefore, $p+q=\boxed{118}$.
\begin{align*} \frac {1}{p} + \frac {1}{q} + \frac {1}{r} + \frac {360}{pqr} & = 1 \\ pq + pr + qr + 360 & =  pqr \\ 360 & =  pqr - pq - pr - qr \\  & =  (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) - (p + q + r) + 1 \\  & =  (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) - 25 \\ 385 & =  (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \\ \end{align*}
From here, you can factor $385$ as $5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11$, giving corresponding values of $6, 8,$ and $12$
The answer is $6 \cdot 8 \cdot 12=\boxed{576}$.
We can calculate\[x^2 + \dfrac{1}{x^2} = \left(x + \dfrac{1}{x}\right)^2 - 2 = 3^2 -2 = 7.\]Similarly,\[x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} = \left(x + \dfrac{1}{x}\right) \left(x^2 + \dfrac{1}{x^2}\right) - \left(x + \dfrac{1}{x}\right) = 3 \cdot 7 - 3 = 18\]and\[x^4 + \dfrac{1}{x^4} = \left(x^2 + \dfrac{1}{x^2}\right)^2 - 2 = 7^2 - 2 = 47.\]Finally,\[x^7 + \dfrac{1}{x^7} = \left(x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3}\right) \left(x^4 + \dfrac{1}{x^4}\right) - \left(x + \dfrac{1}{x}\right) = 18 \cdot 47 - 3 = \boxed{843}.\]
Substituting $\frac{1}{x}$, we have
\[2f\left(\frac 1x\right) + f\left(x\right) = \frac{5}{x} + 4\]
This gives us two equations, which we can eliminate $f\left(\frac 1x\right)$ from (the first equation multiplied by two, subtracting the second):
\begin{align*} 3f(x) &= 10x + 4 - \frac 5x \\ 0 &= x^2 - \frac{3 \times 2004 - 4}{10}x + \frac 52\end{align*}
Clearly, the discriminant of the quadratic equation $\Delta > 0$, so both roots are real
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is the coefficient of the $x$ term, so our answer is $\left[\frac{3 \times 2004 - 4}{10}\right] = \boxed{601}$.
Taking $x = 2$ and $y = 2,$ we get
\[f(4) = f(2) f(2) = 9.\]Taking $x = 4$ and $y = 2,$ we get
\[f(6) = f(4) f(2) = \boxed{27}.\]
We let $e_1 = \zeta_1 + \zeta_2 + \zeta_3,\ e_2 = \zeta_1\zeta_2 + \zeta_2\zeta_3 + \zeta_3\zeta_1,\ e_3 = \zeta_1\zeta_2\zeta_3$ (the elementary symmetric sums)
Then, we can rewrite the above equations as\[\zeta_1+\zeta_2+\zeta_3=e_1 = 1\]\[\zeta_1^2+\zeta_2^2+\zeta_3^2= e_1^2 - 2e_2 = 3\]from where it follows that $e_2 = -1$
The third equation can be factored as\[7 =\zeta_1^3+\zeta_2^3+\zeta_3^3 = (\zeta_1+\zeta_2+\zeta_3)(\zeta_1^2+\zeta_2^2+\zeta_3^2-\zeta_1\zeta_2-\zeta_2\zeta_3 -\zeta_3\zeta_1)+3\zeta_1\zeta_2\zeta_3\\ = e_1^3 - 3e_1e_2 + 3e_3,\]from where it follows that $e_3 = 1$
Thus, applying Vieta's formulas backwards, $\zeta_1, \zeta_2,$ and $\zeta_3$ are the roots of the polynomial\[x^3 - x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \Longleftrightarrow x^3 = x^2 + x + 1\]Let $s_n = \zeta_1^n + \zeta_2^n + \zeta_3^n$ (the power sums)
Then from $(1)$, we have the recursion $s_{n+3} = s_{n+2} + s_{n+1} + s_n$
It follows that $s_4 = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11, s_5 = 21, s_6 = 39, s_7 = \boxed{71}$.
Let $a_n$ denote the number of $n$-letter words ending in two constants (CC), $b_n$ denote the number of $n$-letter words ending in a constant followed by a vowel (CV), and let $c_n$ denote the number of $n$-letter words ending in a vowel followed by a constant (VC - the only other combination, two vowels, is impossible due to the problem statement)
Then, note that:
We can only form a word of length $n+1$ with CC at the end by appending a constant ($M,P$) to the end of a word of length $n$ that ends in a constant
Thus, we have the recursion $a_{n+1} = 2(a_n + c_n)$, as there are two possible constants we can append.
We can only form a word of length $n+1$ with a CV by appending $O$ to the end of a word of length $n$ that ends with CC
This is because we cannot append a vowel to VC, otherwise we'd have two vowels within $2$ characters of each other
Thus, $b_{n+1} = a_n$.
We can only form a word of length $n+1$ with a VC by appending a constant to the end of a word of length $n$ that ends with CV
Thus, $c_{n+1} = 2b_n$.
Using those three recursive rules, and that $a_2 = 4, b_2 = 2, c_2=2$, we can make a table:\[\begin{array}{|r||r|r|r|} \hline &a_n&b_n&c_n \\ \hline 2 & 4 & 2 & 2 \\ 3 & 12 & 4 & 4 \\ 4 & 32 & 12 & 8 \\ 5 & 80 & 32 & 24 \\ 6 & 208 & 80 & 64 \\ 7 & 544 & 208 & 160 \\ 8 & 408 & 544 & 416 \\ 9 & 648 & 408 & 88 \\ 10 & 472 & 648 & 816 \\ \hline \end{array}\]For simplicity, we used $\mod 1000$
Thus, the answer is $a_{10} + b_{10} + c_{10} \equiv \boxed{936} \pmod{1000}$.
Notice that $\sqrt{n + \sqrt{n^2 - 1}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{2n + 2\sqrt{(n+1)(n-1)}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\sqrt{n+1}+\sqrt{n-1}\right)$
Thus, we have
\[\sum_{n = 1}^{9800} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n + \sqrt{n^2 - 1}}}\]\[= \sqrt{2}\sum_{n = 1}^{9800} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}+\sqrt{n-1}}\]\[= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_{n = 1}^{9800} \left(\sqrt{n+1}-\sqrt{n-1}\right)\]
This is a telescoping series; note that when we expand the summation, all of the intermediary terms cancel, leaving us with $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\sqrt{9801}+\sqrt{9800}-\sqrt{1}-\sqrt{0}\right) = 70 + 49\sqrt{2}$, and $p+q+r=\boxed{121}$.
$25^2+72^2=5^4+4\cdot 6^4$, and we can use the Sophie Germain Identity on that to get
\[25^2+72^2=(5^2+2\cdot 6^2+2\cdot 5\cdot 6)(5^2+2\cdot 6^2-2\cdot 5\cdot 6)=157\cdot 37.\]
$\boxed{157}$ is the largest prime factor.
$f(3) = \frac{1 + 3}{1 - 3\cdot 3} = -\frac{1}{2}$
Then $f_1(3) = f(-\frac12) = \frac{1 - \frac12}{1 + 3\cdot\frac12} = \frac15$, $\displaystyle f_2(3) = f(\frac15) = \frac{1 + \frac15}{1 - 3\cdot\frac15} = 3$ and $f_3(3) = f(3) = \frac{1 + 3}{1 - 3\cdot 3} = -\frac{1}{2}$.
It follows immediately that the function cycles and $f_n(3) = -\frac12$ if $n = 3k$, $f_n(3) = \frac15$ if $n = 3k + 1$ and $f_n(3) = 3$ if $n = 3k + 2$
Since $1993 = 3\cdot 664 + 1$, $f_{1993}(3) = \boxed{\frac{1}{5}}$.
The equation has quadratic form, so complete the square to solve for x.
\[x^4 - (4b^2 - 10b)x^2 + 25b^2 = 0\]\[x^4 - (4b^2 - 10b)x^2 + (2b^2 - 5b)^2 - 4b^4 + 20b^3 = 0\]\[(x^2 - (2b^2 - 5b))^2 = 4b^4 - 20b^3\]
In order for the equation to have real solutions,
\[16b^4 - 80b^3 \ge 0\]\[b^3(b - 5) \ge 0\]\[b \le 0 \text{ or } b \ge 5\]
Note that $2b^2 - 5b = b(2b-5)$ is greater than or equal to $0$ when $b \le 0$ or $b \ge 5$
Also, if $b = 0$, then expression leads to $x^4 = 0$ and only has one unique solution, so discard $b = 0$ as a solution
The rest of the values leads to $b^2$ equalling some positive value, so these values will lead to two distinct real solutions.
Therefore, in interval notation, $b \in [-17,0) \cup [5,17]$, so the probability that the equation has at least two distinct real solutions when $b$ is randomly picked from interval $[-17,17]$ is $\frac{29}{34}$
This means that $m+n = \boxed{63}$.
Let the three side lengths be $\tfrac{a}{r}$, $a$, and $ar$
Because the volume of the solid is $216\text{ cm}^3$,\[\frac{a}{r} \cdot a \cdot ar = 216\]\[a = 6\]The surface area of the solid is $288\text{ cm}^2$, so\[2(\frac{a^2}{r} + a^2r + a^2) = 288\]Note that the sum of the side lengths of the cube is $4(\tfrac{6}{r} + 6 + 6r)$ and that the equation above has a similar form.\[2(\frac{36}{r} + 36r + 36) = 288\]\[2(\frac{6}{r} + 6r + 6) = 48\]\[4(\frac{6}{r} + 6r + 6) = 96\]The sum of all the edges of the cube is $\boxed{96}$ centimeters.
Note that for a given integer $a$, where $1 \le a \le 2008$,\[x_a + a = \sum_{n=1}^{2008}x_n + 2009\]Add up the equations for all $a$ to get\[\sum_{n=1}^{2008}x_n + \frac{2009 \cdot 2008}{2} = 2008(\sum_{n=1}^{2008}x_n + 2009)\]We can substitue $S=\sum_{n=1}^{2008}x_n$ and simplify to make the equation look easier to solve.\[S + 2009 \cdot 1004 = 2008S + 2009 \cdot 2008\]\[-2007S = 2009 \cdot 1004\]\[S = \frac{2009 \cdot 1004}{-2007}\]Thus, $\left\lfloor|S|\right\rfloor = \boxed{1005}$.
Because of Vieta's Formulas, if we know the coefficient of the $x^{2007}$ and $x^{2006}$ term, we can find the sum of all the roots
The coefficient of the $x^{2007}$ term is easy to find -- it's $1$
Using the Binomial Theorem in $(x-1)^{2007}$, the coefficient of the $x^{2006}$ term is $-\tbinom{2007}{2006} + 2 = -2005$
Thus, by Vieta's Formulas, the sum of all $2007$ roots is $\tfrac{-(-2005)}{1} = \boxed{2005}$.
The sum can be split into two groups of numbers that we want to add: $\tfrac12 + \tfrac{3}{2^3} + \tfrac{5}{2^5} \cdots$ and $\tfrac{2}{3^2} + \tfrac{4}{3^4} + \tfrac{6}{3^6} \cdots$
Let $X$ be the sum of the first sequence, so we have\begin{align*} X &= \frac12 + \frac{3}{2^3} + \frac{5}{2^5} \cdots \\ \frac{X}{4} &= 0 + \frac{1}{2^3} + \frac{3}{2^5} \cdots \\ \frac{3}{4}X &= \frac12 + \frac{2}{2^3} + \frac{2}{2^5} \cdots \\ \frac{3}{4}X &= \frac12 + \frac{\tfrac14}{\tfrac34} \\ \frac{3}{4}X &= \frac56 \\ X &= \frac{10}{9} \end{align*}
Let $Y$ be the sum of the second sequence, so we have\begin{align*} Y &= \frac{2}{3^2} + \frac{4}{3^4} + \frac{6}{3^6} \cdots \\ \frac{1}{9}Y &= 0 + \frac{2}{3^4} + \frac{4}{3^6} \cdots \\ \frac{8}{9}Y &= \frac{2}{3^2} + \frac{2}{3^4} + \frac{2}{3^6} \cdots \\ \frac{8}{9}Y &= \frac{\frac29}{\frac89} \\ Y &= \frac14 \cdot \frac98 \\ &= \frac{9}{32} \end{align*}That means $\tfrac{a}{b} = \tfrac{10}{9} + \tfrac{9}{32} = \tfrac{401}{288},$ so $a+b = \boxed{689}.$
The cubic passes through the points $(2,1),$ $(7,19),$ $(15,11),$ and $(20,29).$  When these points are plotted, we find that they form the vertices of a parallelogram, whose center is $(11,15).$  We take advantage of this as follows.

Let $f(x) = p(x + 11) - 15.$  Then
\begin{align*}
f(-9) &= p(2) - 15 = -14, \\
f(-4) &= p(7) - 15 = 4, \\
f(4) &= p(15) - 15 = -4, \\
f(9) &= p(20) - 15 = 14.
\end{align*}Now, let $g(x) = -f(-x).$  Then
\begin{align*}
g(-9) &= -f(9) = -14, \\
g(-4) &= -f(4) = 4, \\
g(4) &= -f(-4) = -4, \\
g(9) &= -f(-9) = 14.
\end{align*}Both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are cubic polynomials, and they agree at four different values, so by the Identity Theorem, they are the same polynomial
In other words,
\[-f(-x) = f(x).\]Then
\[15 - p(11 - x) = p(x + 11) - 15,\]so
\[p(11 - x) + p(x + 11) = 30\]for all $x.$
\[S = p(1) + p(2) + p(3) + \dots + p(21).\]Then
\[S = p(21) + p(20) + p(19) + \dots + p(1),\]so
\[2S = [p(1) + p(21)] + [p(2) + p(20)] + [p(3) + p(19)] + \dots + [p(21) + p(1)].\]Since $p(11 - x) + p(x + 11) = 30,$ each of these summands is equal to 30
Therefore,
\[2S = 21 \cdot 30 = 630,\]and $S = 630/2 = \boxed{315}.$
First, observe that the difference between consecutive terms within a grouping will always equal $3.$ Second, since all terms in a group with $n$ terms are congruent to $n$ modulo $3$ and all terms in a group with $n+1$ terms are congruent to $n+1$ modulo $3,$ the difference between the first term of the group with $n+1$ terms and the last term of the group with $n$ terms is $1.$ This means that the difference between the last terms of a grouping $(1,5,12,22 \cdots)$ have the same second difference, so the series of numbers can be modeled by a quadratic function.
Let $n$ be the number of terms in a group, and let $f(n)$ be the last term in a group with $n$ terms
We can write a system of equations to find a quadratic function.\begin{align*} a+b+c &= 1 \\ 4a+2b+c &= 5 \\ 9a+3b+c &= 12 \end{align*}Solving the system yields $a=\tfrac32, b=-\tfrac12, c=0,$ making the function $f(n) = \tfrac32 x^2 - \tfrac12 x = \tfrac{x(3x-1)}{2}.$
Note that the last term of the group with $n$ terms is term $\tfrac{n(n+1)}{2}$ in the sequence
The largest $n$ such that $\tfrac{n(n+1)}{2} \le 2008$ is $62,$ and $f(62) = \tfrac{62 \cdot 185}{2} = 5735.$ Since $\tfrac{62 \cdot 63}{2} = 1953,$ the $1953^\text{th}$ term of the sequence is $5735.$ This means the $1954^\text{th}$ term is $5736,$ and with some basic algebra (or skip counting), the $2008^\text{th}$ term is $\boxed{5898}.$
With summation notation, $S = \sum_{i=1}^{2007} \sqrt{1 + \tfrac{1}{i^2} + \tfrac{1}{(i+1)^2}}$
By using a common denominator and simplifying, we have
\begin{align*} S &= \sum_{i=1}^{2007} \sqrt{ \frac{i^2 (i^2 + 2i + 1) + i^2 + 2i + 1 + i^2}{i^2 (i+1)^2} } \\ &= \sum_{i=1}^{2007} \sqrt{ \frac{i^4 + 2i^3 + 3i^2 + 2i + 1}{i^2 (i+1)^2} } \\ &= \sum_{i=1}^{2007} \sqrt{ \frac{(i^2 + i + 1)^2}{i^2 (i+1)^2} } \\ &= \sum_{i=1}^{2007} \frac{i^2 + i + 1}{i^2 + i} \\ &= \sum_{i=1}^{2007} (1 + \frac{1}{i(i+1)}) \\ &= \sum_{i=1}^{2007} (1 + \frac{1}{i} - \frac{1}{i+1}) \end{align*}
Notice that part of the terms telescope, making calculation simpler
Calculation results in $S = 2007 + 1 - \tfrac{1}{2008}$
Thus, $S^2 = (2008 - \tfrac{1}{2008})^2 = 4032064 - 2 + (\tfrac{1}{2008})^2$
Since $0 < (\tfrac{1}{2008})^2 < 1$, we conclude that $\lfloor S^2\rfloor = \boxed{4032062}$.
By Vieta's Formulas, $r_1 + r_2 = s$
That means $r_1^2 + r_2^2 = s^2 - 2p = s$ and $r_1^3 + r_1^3 = (r_1 + r_2)^3 - 3r_1^2r_2 - 3r_1r_2^2 = s^3 - 3ps$.
Note that $s = s^2 - 2p$, so $p = \frac{s^2 - s}{2}$
We also know that $s = s^3 - 3ps$, so substituting for $p$ results in
\begin{align*} s &= s^3 - 3s \cdot \frac{s^2 - s}{2} \\ s &= s^3 - \tfrac32 s^3 + \tfrac32 s^2 \\ 0 &= -\tfrac12 s^3 + \tfrac32 s^2 - s \\ 0 &= s^3 - 3s^2 + 2s \\ &= s(s-2)(s-1) \end{align*}
Thus, $s = 0,1,2$
If $s = 1$ or $s = 0$, then $p = 0$
However, both cases result in one root being zero, so $\dfrac1{r_1^{2008}}+\dfrac1{r_2^{2008}}$ is undefined
If $s = 2$, then $p = 1$, making both roots equal to $1$
Since $1^n = 1$ for $1 \le n \le 2007$, this result satisfies all conditions
Thus, $\dfrac1{r_1^{2008}}+\dfrac1{r_2^{2008}} = 1+1 = \boxed{2}$.
By Vieta's Formulas, given that $r_1, r_2, \cdots r_n$ are roots of the polynomial, we know that $\sum_{i=1}^n r_i = -a_{n-1}$ and $r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 \cdots r_{n-1}r_n = a_{n-2}$.
From the equation $\sum_{i=1}^n r_i = -a_{n-1}$, squaring both sides and substituting results in\begin{align*} \sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2 + 2(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 \cdots r_{n-1}r_n) &= (a_{n-1})^2 \\ \sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2 + 2a_{n-2} &= (-a_{n-2})^2 \\ \sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2 &= (a_{n-2})^2 - 2a_{n-2} \end{align*}To find the lower bound of $\sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2$, we need to find the lower bound of $(a_{n-2})^2 - 2a_{n-2}$
The minimum of the quadratic is $-1$, so the absolute value of the lower bound of the sum of the squares is $\boxed{1}$.
$x^4+x^3+2x^2+x+1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 + x + 1)$
We apply the polynomial generalization of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
Indeed,
$p(x) = (x^{2008} + x^{2007} + x^{2006}) + \cdots + (x^4 + x^3 + x^2) + x + 1 \equiv x+1 \pmod{x^2 + x + 1}$
since $x^{n+2} + x_{n+1} + x^{n} = x^{n-2}(x^2 + x + 1) \equiv 0 \pmod{x^2 + x + 1}$
$p(x) = (x^{2008} + x^{2006}) + (x^{2007} + x^{2005}) + \cdots + (x^4 + x^2) + (x^3 + x) + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{x^2 + 1}$
using similar reasoning
Hence $p(x) \equiv x+1 \pmod{x^2 + x + 1}, p(x) \equiv 1 \pmod{x^2 + 1}$, and by CRT we have $p(x) \equiv -x^2 \pmod{x^4+x^3+2x^2+x+1}$.
Then $|r(2008)| \equiv 2008^2 \equiv \boxed{64} \pmod{1000}$.
Notice that $\sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$, so\begin{align*} \sum_{i=n+1}^{2n} i^2 &= \sum_{i=1}^{2n} i^2 - \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 \\ &= \frac{2n(2n+1)(4n+1)}{6} - \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \\ &= \frac{16n^3 + 12n^2 + 2n}{6} - \frac{2n^3 + 3n^2 + n}{6} \\ &= \frac{14n^3 + 9n^2 + n}{6} \\ &= \frac{n(2n+1)(7n+1)}{6} \end{align*}Thus, $\left( \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 \right)\left(\sum_{i=n+1}^{2n} i^2 \right) = \frac{n^2 (2n+1)^2 (n+1)(7n+1)}{36}$
In order for the expression to be a perfect square, $(n+1)(7n+1)$ must be a perfect square.
By using the Euclidean Algorithm, $\gcd(n+1,7n+1) = \gcd(n+1,6)$
Thus, the GCD of $n+1$ and $7n+1$ must be factors of 6
Now, split the factors as different casework
Note that the quadratic residues of 7 are 0, 1, 2, and 4.
If $\gcd(n+1,7n+1) = 6$, then $n \equiv 5 \pmod{6}$
Let $n = 6a+5$, so $(n+1)(7n+1) = (6a+6)(42a+36) = 36(a+1)(7a+6)$
Since 6 is divided out of $n+1$ and $7n+1$, $a+1$ and $7a+6$ are relatively prime, so $a+1$ and $7a+6$ must be perfect squares
However, since 6 is not a quadratic residue of 7, the GCD of $n+1$ and $7n+1$ can not be 6.
If $\gcd(n+1,7n+1) = 3$, then $n \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$
Let $n = 3a+2$, so $(n+1)(7n+1) = (3a+3)(21a+15) = 9(a+1)(7a+5)$
Since 3 is divided out of $n+1$ and $7n+1$, $a+1$ and $7a+5$ are relatively prime, so $a+1$ and $7a+5$ must be perfect squares
However, since 5 is not a quadratic residue of 7, the GCD of $n+1$ and $7n+1$ can not be 3.
If $\gcd(n+1,7n+1) = 2$, then $n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$
Let $n = 2a+1$, so $(n+1)(7n+1) = (2a+2)(14a+8) = 4(a+1)(7a+4)$
Since 2 is divided out of $n+1$ and $7n+1$, $a+1$ and $7a+4$ are relatively prime, so $a+1$ and $7a+4$ must be perfect squares
We also know that $n+1$ and $7n+1$ do not share a factor of 3, so $n \equiv 1,3 \pmod{6}$
That means $n \le 2007$, so $a \le 1003$
After trying values of $a$ that are one less than a perfect square, we find that the largest value that makes $(n+1)(7n+1)$ a perfect square is $a = 960$
That means $n = 1921$.
If $\gcd(n+1,7n+1) = 1$, then $n+1 \equiv 1,5 \pmod{6}$ (to avoid common factors that are factors of 6), so $n \equiv 0,4 \pmod{6}$
After trying values of $n$ that are one less than a perfect square, we find that the largest value that makes $(n+1)(7n+1)$ a perfect square is $n = 120$ (we could also stop searching once $n$ gets below 1921).
From the casework, the largest natural number $n$ that makes $(1^2+2^2+3^2+\cdots + n^2)\left[(n+1)^2+(n+2)^2+(n+3)^2+\cdots + (2n)^2\right]$ is a perfect square is $\boxed{1921}$.
Let the roots of the quadratic be $r$ and $s$
By Vieta's Formulas, $r+s = -b$ and $rs$ = $2008b$.
We know that one of the possible values of $b$ is 0 because $x^2$ has integer roots
However, adding or removing 0 does not affect the value of $S$, so we can divide both sides by $-b$
Doing so results in\begin{align*} \frac{rs}{r+s} &= -2008 \\ rs &= -2008r - 2008s \\ rs + 2008r + 2008s &= 0 \\ (r+2008)(s+2008) &= 2008^2
\end{align*}WLOG, let $|a| \le 2008$ be a factor of $2008^2$, so $r+2008 = a$ and $s+2008 = \tfrac{2008^2}{a}$
Thus,\[-r-s = b = -a - \tfrac{2008^2}{a} + 4016.\]Since $a$ can be positive or negative, the positive values cancel with the negative values
The prime factorization of $2008^2$ is $2^6 \cdot 251^2$, so there are $\frac{21+2}{2} = 11$ positive factors that are less than $2008$
Thus, there are a total of $22$ values of $a$, so the absolute value of the sum of all values of $b$ equals $4016 \cdot 22 = \boxed{88352}$.
Note that when multiplying quadratics, terms add up similar to the equations of a system, so let\begin{align*} p(x) &= (x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d) \\ &= x^4 + (a+b)x^3 + (ab+c+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + cd \\ &= x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96 \end{align*}Factoring $p(x)$ with the Rational Root Theorem results in $(x+4)(x+4)(x+1)(x+6)$
By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, we know that $x+4, x+4, x+1, x+6$ are all the linear factors of the polynomial, so the quadratic factors can only be multiplied from these linear factors.
There are only two possible distinct groupings (not counting rearrangements) -- $(x^2 + 8x + 16)(x^2 + 7x + 6)$ and $(x^2 + 5x + 4)(x^2 + 10x + 24)$
In the first case, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 405$, and in the second case, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 717$
The largest of the two options is $\boxed{717}$.
Note that $c = \tfrac{1000}{a}$ and $d = \tfrac{1000}{b}$
Substituting $c$ and $d$ results in $\frac{1000000}{a^2} + \frac{1000000}{b^2} = \frac{1000000(a^2 + b^2)}{a^2 b^2} = 2008$
Since $a^2 + b^2 = 2008$, $a^2 b^2 = 1000000$, so $ab = 1000$
Thus, $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 4008$, so $a+b = \sqrt{4008} = 2\sqrt{1002}$.
Note that if we solve for $a$ and $b$ and substitute, we can use the same steps to show that $c+d = 2\sqrt{1002}$
Thus, $S = 4\sqrt{1002} \approx 126.62$, so $\lfloor S\rfloor = \boxed{126}$.
Using the definition of base numbers, $100111011_6 = 6^8 + 6^5 + 6^4 + 6^3 + 6 + 1$
Let $x = 6$, so the number equals $x^8 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1$.
By using the Rational Root Theorem, $x+1$ is a factor of $x^8 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1$, so the polynomial factors into $(x+1)(x^7 - x^6 + x^5 + x^3 + 1)$.
The first three terms share a common factor of $x^5$, and the last two terms is a sum of cubes, so the expression can be grouped and factored as $(x+1)(x^5 (x^2 - x + 1) + (x+1)(x^2 - x + 1) = (x+1)(x^2 - x + 1)(x^5 + x + 1)$.
To factor the quintic polynomial, add and subtract $x^2$ to get $x^5 - x^2 + x^2 + x + 1$
Factoring out $x^2$ in the first two terms results in $x^2 (x^3 - 1) + x^2 + x + 1 = x^2 (x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) + x^2 + x + 1$, and factoring by grouping results in $(x^2 + x + 1)(x^3 - x^2 + 1)$.
Thus, the polynomial can be factored into $(x+1)(x^2 - x + 1)(x^2 + x + 1)(x^3 - x^2 + 1)$, and substituting $x = 6$ results in $7 \cdot 31 \cdot 43 \cdot 181$
A prime test shows that $\boxed{181}$ is the largest prime factor of $100111011_6$ in decimal form.
We can write the equation of the hyperbola as
\[\frac{x^2}{144/25} - \frac{y^2}{81/25} = 1,\]so for the hyperbola, $a = \frac{12}{5}$ and $b = \frac{9}{5}.$  Then
\[c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{\frac{144}{25} + \frac{81}{25}} = 3.\]Thus, the foci are at $(\pm 3,0).$
Then for the ellipse, $a^2 = 16,$ so
\[b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 16 - 9 = \boxed{7}.\]
We have \[\left|\frac12 - \frac38i\right| = \left|\frac{1}{8}\left(4 - 3i\right)\right| = \frac18|4-3i| = \frac18\sqrt{4^2 +(-3)^2} = \boxed{\frac58}.\]
We can rewrite the third equation as \[f(x, x+y) = \frac{x+y}{y} \cdot f(x, y),\]or, making the substitution $t = x+y,$ \[f(x, t) = \frac{t}{t-x} \cdot f(x, t-x)\]whenever $x < t.$ In particular, if $r \neq 0$ is the remainder when $t$ is divided by $x,$ then repeatedly applying this relation, we have \[\begin{aligned} f(x, t) &= \frac{t}{t-x} \cdot f(x, t-x) \\ &= \frac{t}{t-x} \cdot \frac{t-x}{t-2x} \cdot f(x, t-2x) \\ &= \dotsb \\ &= \frac{t}{t-x} \cdot \frac{t-x}{t-2x} \cdots \frac{r+x}{r} \cdot f(x, r) \\ &= \frac{t}{r} \cdot f(x, r) \end{aligned}\]since the product telescopes
Then we may compute $f(14, 52)$ as follows, swapping the two arguments of $f$ as necessary using the second equation: \[\begin{aligned} f(14, 52) &= \frac{52}{10} \cdot f(14, 10) \\ &= \frac{52}{10} \cdot \frac{14}{4} \cdot f(10, 4) \\ &= \frac{52}{10} \cdot \frac{14}{4} \cdot \frac{10}{2} \cdot f(4, 2)\\ &= \frac{52}{10} \cdot \frac{14}{4} \cdot \frac{10}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{2} \cdot f(2, 2) \\ &= \frac{52}{\cancel{10}} \cdot \frac{14}{\cancel{4}} \cdot \frac{\cancel{10}}{2} \cdot \frac{\cancel{4}}{2} \cdot 2 \\ &= \boxed{364}
\end{aligned}\]
Setting $x = -2,$ we get
\[3 f \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) - f(-2) = 4.\]Setting $x = -\frac{1}{2},$ we get
\[3f(-2) - 4 f \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{4}.\]Solving these equations as a system in $f(-2)$ and $f \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right),$ we find $f(-2) = \boxed{\frac{67}{20}}$ and $f \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{49}{20}.$
The squared terms suggests the quadratic mean
Since we have no reciprocals or products, we can start with the QM-AM inequality on the numbers $a+b$, $b-c$, and $c-a$, which gives us
$$\sqrt{\frac{(a+b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2}{3}}\ge\frac{(a+b)+(b-c)+(c-a)}{3}=\frac{2b}{3}.$$Squaring both sides gives
$$\frac{(a+b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2}{3}\ge\frac{4b^2}{9}.$$Dividing both sides by $b^2$ and multiplting both sides by $3$ gives us
$$\frac{(a+b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2}{b^2}\ge\frac{4}{3}.$$Equality is achieved if $a+b=b-c=c-a$
From $a+b=b-c$ we get that $a=-c$
Then $a+b=c-a$ gives us $b=3c$
Hence if we pick $c=1$, $a=-1$, and $b=3$, we have $$\frac{(a+b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2}{b^2}=\frac{(-1+3)^2+(3-1)^2+(1+1)^2}{3^2}=\frac{12}{9} = \boxed{\frac{4}{3}}.$$
Consider the function $g(x) = x^2 - 360x + 400$, then obviously $f(x) = g(x^2)$.
The roots of $g$ are: \begin{align*}
x_{1,2}
= \frac{ 360 \pm \sqrt{ 360^2 - 4\cdot 400 } }2
= 180 \pm 80 \sqrt 5
\end{align*}We can then write $g(x) = (x - 180 - 80\sqrt 5)(x - 180 + 80\sqrt 5)$, and thus $f(x) = (x^2 - 180 - 80\sqrt 5)(x^2 - 180 + 80\sqrt 5)$.
We would now like to factor the right hand side further, using the formula $(x^2 - y^2) = (x-y)(x+y)$
To do this, we need to express both constants as squares of some other constants
Luckily, we have a pretty good idea what they look like.
We are looking for rational $a$ and $b$ such that $(a+b\sqrt 5)^2 = 180 + 80\sqrt 5$
Expanding the left hand side and comparing coefficients, we get $ab=40$ and $a^2 + 5b^2 = 180$
We can easily guess (or compute) the solution $a=10$, $b=4$.
Hence $180 + 80\sqrt 5 = (10 + 4\sqrt 5)^2$, and we can also easily verify that $180 - 80\sqrt 5 = (10 - 4\sqrt 5)^2$.
We now know the complete factorization of $f(x)$: \begin{align*}
f(x) = (x - 10 - 4\sqrt 5)(x + 10 + 4\sqrt 5)(x - 10 + 4\sqrt 5)(x + 10 - 4\sqrt 5)
\end{align*}As the final step, we can now combine the factors in a different way, in order to get rid of the square roots.
We have $(x - 10 - 4\sqrt 5)(x - 10 + 4\sqrt 5) = (x-10)^2 - (4\sqrt 5)^2 = x^2 - 20x + 20$, and $(x + 10 - 4\sqrt 5)(x + 10 + 4\sqrt 5) = x^2 + 20x + 20$.
Hence we obtain the factorization $f(x) = (x^2 - 20x + 20)(x^2 + 20x + 20)$.
For $x\geq 20$, both terms are positive and larger than one, hence $f(x)$ is not prime
For $1<x<19$, the second factor is positive and the first one is negative, hence $f(x)$ is not prime
The remaining cases are $x=1$ and $x=19$
In both cases, $f(x)$ is indeed a prime, and their sum is $f(1) + f(19) = 41 + 761 = \boxed{802}$.
Because the given quadratic has leading coefficient $1$, both factors must be of the form $x-c$ (or $-x+c$)
Therefore, such a factorization exists if and only if $x^2 + ax + b$ has two integer roots
Letting $r$ and $s$ denote these roots, we have, by Vieta's formulas, \[\begin{aligned} r+s &= -a, \\ rs &= b
\end{aligned}\]Since $r+s = -a$ is negative but $rs = b$ is nonnegative, it follows that both $r$ and $s$ must be negative or zero
Now, for each $a$, there are $a+1$ possible pairs $(r, s)$, which are $(0, -a)$, $(-1, -a+1)$, $\ldots$, $(-a, 0)$
However, since the order of $r$ and $s$ does not matter, we only get $\lceil \tfrac{a+1}{2} \rceil$ distinct polynomials $x^2+ax+b$ for each possible value of $a$
It follows that the number of these polynomials is \[\sum_{a=1}^{100} \left\lceil \frac{a+1}{2} \right\rceil = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + \dots + 50 + 50 + 51 = \boxed{2600}\]since if we pair up the terms in this sum end-to-end, each pair has a sum of $52 = 2 \cdot 26$.
Recall that a parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus $F$ and the directrix.
Since the parabola $x = -\frac{1}{12} y^2$ is symmetric about the $x$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(f,0).$  Let $x = d$ be the equation of the directrix.
unitsize(1.5 cm);

Let $\left( -\frac{1}{12} y^2, y \right)$ be a point on the parabola $x = -\frac{1}{12} y^2.$  Then
\[PF^2 = \left( -\frac{1}{12} y^2 - f \right)^2 + y^2\]and $PQ^2 = \left( -\frac{1}{12} y^2 - d \right)^2.$  Thus,
\[\left( -\frac{1}{12} y^2 - f \right)^2 + y^2 = \left( -\frac{1}{12} y^2 - d \right)^2.\]Expanding, we get
\[\frac{1}{144} y^4 + \frac{f}{6} y^2 + f^2 + y^2 = \frac{1}{144} y^4 + \frac{d}{6} y^2 + d^2.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
\frac{f}{6} + 1 &= \frac{d}{6}, \\
f^2 &= d^2.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $d - f = 6.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $-2f = 6,$ so $f = -3.$
Thus, the focus $\boxed{(-3,0)}.$
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution.
The radical conjugate of this number is $10 + \sqrt{2018},$ so when we add them, the radical parts cancel, giving $10 + 10 = \boxed{20}.$
Squaring $x - \frac{1}{x} = i \sqrt{2},$ we get
\[x^2 - 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = -2.\]Hence, $x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 0,$ so $x^4 + 1 = 0,$ or $x^4 = -1.$
\[x^{2187} = (x^4)^{546} \cdot x^3 = x^3,\]so
\begin{align*}
x^{2187} - \frac{1}{x^{2187}} &= x^3 - \frac{1}{x^3} \\
&= \left( x - \frac{1}{x} \right) \left( x^2 + 1 + \frac{1}{x^2} \right) \\
&= \boxed{i \sqrt{2}}.
\end{align*}
Let $P = \left( \frac{a^2}{2}, a \right)$ be a point on the parabola
First, we find the equation of the tangent to the parabola at $P.$
unitsize(0.5 cm);
real y;
pair P = (8,4);
path parab = ((-5)^2/2,-5);
for (y = -5; y <= 5; y = y + 0.01) {
parab = parab--(y^2/2,y);
draw(parab,red);
draw((P + (-4,-4/4))--(P + (4,4/4)),dashed);
draw((-2,0)--(15,0));
draw((0,-5)--(0,5));
dot("$P$", P, S);
[/asy]
Since the tangent passes through $\left( \frac{a^2}{2}, a \right),$ the equation of the tangent is of the form
\[y - a = m \left( x - \frac{a^2}{2} \right) = mx - \frac{a^2 m}{2}.\]Substituting $x = \frac{y^2}{2},$ we get
\[y - a = \frac{my^2}{2} - \frac{a^2 m}{2}.\]This simplifies to $my^2 - 2y + 2a - a^2 m = 0.$  Since this is the equation of a tangent, the quadratic should have a double root of $y = a,$ which means its discriminant is 0, which gives us
\[4 - 4m(2a - a^2 m) = 0.\]Then $4a^2 m^2 - 8am + 4 = 4(am - 1)^2 = 0,$ so $m = \frac{1}{a}.$
Now, consider the point $P$ that is closest to $(6,12).$
unitsize(0.5 cm);
real y;
pair P = (8,4);
path parab = ((-2)^2/2,-2);
for (y = -2; y <= 5; y = y + 0.01) {
parab = parab--(y^2/2,y);
draw(parab,red);
draw((-2,0)--(15,0));
draw((0,-2)--(0,15));
draw(P--(6,12));
draw((P + (-4,-4/4))--(P + (4,4/4)),dashed);
dot("$(6,12)$", (6,12), N);
dot("$P$", P, S);
[/asy]
Geometrically, the line connecting $P$ and $(6,12)$ is perpendicular to the tangent
In terms of slopes, this gives us
\[\frac{a - 12}{\frac{a^2}{2} - 6} \cdot \frac{1}{a} = -1.\]This simplifies to $a^3 - 10a - 24 = 0,$ which factors as $(a - 4)(a^2 + 4a + 6) = 0.$  The quadratic factor has no real roots, so $a = 4.$  Therefore, $P = (8,4),$ and the shortest distance is $\sqrt{(8 - 6)^2 + (4 - 12)^2} = \boxed{2 \sqrt{17}}.$
Setting $n = 0,$ we get
\[f(m) + f(-1) = f(m) f(0) + 2.\]If $f(0) \neq 1,$ then $f(m)$ is equal to some constant, say $c.$  Then
\[2c = c^2 + 2,\]which has no integer solutions
Therefore, $f(0) = 1,$ and then $f(-1) = 2.$
Setting $n = 1,$ we get
\[f(m + 1) + f(m - 1) = f(1) f(m) + 2.\]Let $a = f(1)$; then
\[f(m + 1) = af(m) - f(m - 1) + 2.\]Since $f(0) = 1$ and $f(1) = a,$
\begin{align*}
f(2) &= af(1) - f(0) + 2 = a^2 + 1, \\
f(3) &= af(2) - f(1) + 2 = a^3 + 2, \\
f(4) &= af(3) - f(2) + 2 = a^4 - a^2 + 2a + 1, \\
f(5) &= af(4) - f(3) + 2 = a^5 - 2a^3 + 2a^2 + a.
\end{align*}Setting $m = n = 2,$ we get
\[f(4) + f(3) = f(2)^2 + 2.\]Then $(a^4 - a^2 + 2a + 1) + (a^3 + 2) = (a^2 + 1)^2 + 2,$ which simplifies to
\[a^3 - 3a^2 + 2a = 0.\]This factors as $a(a - 1)(a - 2) = 0.$  Hence, $a \in \{0, 1, 2\}.$
Setting $m = 2$ and $n = 3,$ we get
\[f(5) + f(5) = f(2) f(3) + 2.\]Then $2(a^5 - 2a^3 + 2a^2 + a) = (a^2 + 1)(a^3 + 2) + 2.$  Checking $a = 0,$ $a = 1,$ and $a = 2,$ we find that the only value that works is $a = 2.$
Hence,
\[f(m + 1) = 2f(m) - f(m - 1) + 2.\]The first few values are
\begin{align*}
f(2) &= 2f(1) - f(0) + 2 = 5, \\
f(3) &= 2f(2) - f(1) + 2 = 10, \\
f(4) &= 2f(3) - f(2) + 2 = 17,
\end{align*}and so on
By a straight-forward induction argument,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1\]for all integers $n.$
We can check that this function works
Therefore, $n = 1$ and $s = 5,$ so $n \times s = \boxed{5}.$
We can factor $x^4+64$ as a difference of squares:
\begin{align*}
x^4+64 &= (x^2)^2 - (8i)^2 \\
&= (x^2-8i)(x^2+8i).
\end{align*}Thus, the solutions are the square roots of $8i$ and $-8i$.
The square roots of $i$ are $\pm\left(\frac{\sqrt 2}2+\frac{\sqrt 2}2i\right)$
Thus, the square roots of $8i$ are $\pm\sqrt 8\left(\frac{\sqrt 2}2+\frac{\sqrt 2}2i\right) = \pm(2+2i)$, and the square roots of $-8i$ are $\pm\sqrt{-8}\left(\frac{\sqrt 2}2+\frac{\sqrt 2}2i\right) = \pm(2i-2)$.
Therefore, the solutions of the original equation are $x=\boxed{2+2i,\,-2-2i,\,-2+2i,\,2-2i}$.
Calculate the magnitudes
$$|t+2i\sqrt{3}| |6-4i| = \sqrt{t^2+12} \cdot \sqrt{36+16} = \sqrt{t^2+12} \cdot \sqrt{52} = \sqrt{t^2+12} \cdot 2\sqrt{13}$$Set this equal to $26$
$$\sqrt{t^2+12} \cdot 2\sqrt{13} = 26$$Solve for $t$
$$\sqrt{t^2+12} \cdot \sqrt{13} = 13$$$$\sqrt{t^2+12} = \sqrt{13}$$We need the positive value, so $t = \boxed{1}$.
Let \[f(t) = x_1(t+1)^2 + x_2(t+2)^2 + \cdots + x_7(t+7)^2.\]Then the three given equations say $f(0) = 1$, $f(1) = 12$, and $f(2) = 123$, and we want to find $f(3)$.
Since $f(t)$ is a quadratic, we may let $f(t) = At^2 + Bt + C$, where $A, B, C$ are constant
Then we have the equations \[\begin{aligned} C &= 1, \\ A+B+C &= 12, \\ 4A+2B+C &= 123
\end{aligned} \]Substituting $C=1$ into the second and third equations gives $A+B=11$ and $4A+2B=122.$ Then $2A+B=61,$ so $A = (2A+B)-(A+B) = 61-11=50.$ Then $B=11-A=-39,$ and so \[f(3) = 9A+3B+C=9(50)+3(-39)+1= \boxed{334}.\]
Since there is a hole at $x = 5,$ both the numerator and denominator must have a factor of $x - 5.$  Since there is a vertical asymptote at $x = -2,$ we can assume that $q(x) = (x - 5)(x + 2).$
Since the graph passes through $(1,0),$ $p(x) = k(x - 5)(x - 1)$ for some constant $k,$ so
\[\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \frac{k(x - 5)(x - 1)}{(x - 5)(x + 2)} = \frac{k(x - 1)}{x + 2}\]for $x \neq 5.$
Since the vertical asymptote is $y = 2,$ $k = 2,$ and
\[\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \frac{2(x - 1)}{x + 2}\]for $x \neq 5.$  Hence,
\[\frac{p(3)}{q(3)} = \frac{2(2)}{5} = \boxed{\frac{4}{5}}.\]
Since $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are consecutive positive integers, we can replace them with $x-1$, $x$ , $x+1$, and $x+2$
Substituting these into the equation, we have \begin{align*}
(x-1)^3+x^3+(x+1)^3&=(x+2)^3 \implies \\
(x^3-3x^2+3x-1)+x^3+(x^3+3x^2+3x+1)&=x^3+6x+12x^2+12 \implies \\
2x^3-6x^2-6x-8 &= 0 \implies \\
x^3-3x^2-3x-4 &= 0.
\end{align*} By the rational root theorem, the only possible rational solutions of the equation are $\pm1$, $\pm2$, and $\pm4$
Since the question suggests that there are positive integer solutions, we try dividing $x^3-3x^2-3x-4$ by $(x-1)$, $(x-2)$ and $(x-4)$ using synthetic division
We find that $x^3-3x^2-3x-4=(x-4)(x^2+x+1)$
The quadratic factor does not factor further since its discriminant is $1^2-4\cdot1\cdot1=-3$
Therefore, $x=4$ is the only integer solution of the equation, which implies that $z=\boxed{6}$.
By the Rational Root Theorem, the only possible rational roots are of the form $\pm \frac{a}{b},$ where $a$ divides 15 and $b$ divides 9
Thus, the possible rational roots are
\[\pm 1, \ \pm 3, \ \pm 5, \ \pm 15, \ \pm \frac{1}{3}, \ \pm \frac{5}{3}, \ \pm \frac{1}{9}, \ \pm \frac{5}{9}.\]Thus, there are $\boxed{16}$ possible rational roots.
\[f(a,b,c,d) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 - (ab + \lambda bc + cd).\]For fixed values of $b,$ $c,$ and $d,$ $f(a,b,c,d)$ is minimized when $a = \frac{b}{2}.$  Similarly, for fixed values of $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $f(a,b,c,d)$ is minimized when $d = \frac{c}{2}.$  Thus, it suffices to look at the case where $a = \frac{b}{2}$ and $d = \frac{c}{2},$ in which case the given inequality becomes
\[\frac{5b^2}{4} + \frac{5c^2}{4} \ge \frac{b^2}{2} + \lambda bc + \frac{c^2}{2},\]or $5b^2 + 5c^2 \ge 2b^2 + 4 \lambda bc + 2c^2.$  This reduces to
\[3b^2 + 3c^2 \ge 4 \lambda bc.\]Taking $b = c = 1,$ we find $6 \ge 4 \lambda,$ so $\lambda \le \frac{3}{2}.$
On the other hand, if $\lambda = \frac{3}{2},$ then the inequality above becomes
\[3b^2 + 3c^2 \ge 6bc,\]which holds due to AM-GM
Therefore, the largest such $\lambda$ is $\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}.$
By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is the negation of the constant term divided by the leading ($x^3$) coefficient
Therefore, the answer is \[\frac{-27}{3} = \boxed{-9}.\](Don't forget to divide by the leading coefficient of the polynomial!)
Let $r$ and $s$ be the two common roots
Then $r$ and $s$ are the roots of
\[(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - (x^3 + bx^2 + 14 + 8) = (a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2.\]Note that $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of
\begin{align*}
&4(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - 3(x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8) \\
&= x^3 + (4a - 3b) x^2 + 2x \\
&= x[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2].
\end{align*}Since the constant coefficient of $x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6$ is nonzero, both $r$ and $s$ are non-zero
Therefore, $r$ and $s$ are the roots of
\[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2.\]Hence, both $r$ and $s$ are the roots of $-x^2 + (3b - 4a) x - 2.$  But $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of $(a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2,$ so the coefficients must match
This gives us $a - b = -1$ and $3b - 4a = -3.$  Solving, we find $(a,b) = \boxed{(6,7)}.$
For these values, the given cubics become
\begin{align*}
x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 &= (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3), \\
x^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8 &= (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 4).
\end{align*}
Let $r = |a| = |b| = |c|.$  We can re-arrange $az^2 + bz + c = 0$ as
\[az^2 = -bz - c.\]By the Triangle Inequality,
\[|az^2| = |-bz - c| \le |bz| + |c|,\]so $|a||z|^2 \le |b||z| + |c|,$ or $r|z|^2 \le r|z| + r.$  Then
\[|z|^2 \le |z| + 1,\]so $|z|^2 - |z| - 1 \le 0.$  This factors as
\[\left( |z| - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) \left( |z| - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) \le 0,\]so $|z| \le \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.$
The numbers $a = 1,$ $b = -1,$ $c = -1,$ and $z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ satisfy the given conditions, so the largest possible value of $|z|$ is $\boxed{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}.$
Let the equation of the circle be $(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2.$  From $xy = 1,$ $y = \frac{1}{x}.$  Substituting, we get
\[(x - a)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{x} - b \right)^2 = r^2.\]Then
\[x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} - \frac{2b}{x} + b^2 = r^2,\]so
\[x^4 - 2ax^3 + (a^2 + b^2 - r^2) x^2 - 2bx + 1 = 0.\]By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is 1
Three of the roots are 2, $-5,$ and $\frac{1}{3},$ so the fourth root is $-\frac{3}{10}.$  Therefore, the fourth point is $\boxed{\left( -\frac{3}{10}, -\frac{10}{3} \right)}.$
The given inequality is equivalent to
\[\frac{1}{2x + 3} + 2 > 0,\]or
\[\frac{4x + 7}{2x + 3} > 0.\]If $x < -\frac{7}{4},$ then $4x + 7 < 0$ and $2x + 3 < 0,$ so the inequality is satisfied.
If $-\frac{7}{4} < x < -\frac{3}{2},$ then $4x + 7 > 0$ and $2x + 3 < 0,$ so the inequality is not satisfied.
If $x > -\frac{3}{2},$ then $4x + 7 > 0$ and $2x + 3 > 0,$ so the inequality is satisfied
Thus, the solution is
\[x \in \boxed{\left( -\infty, -\frac{7}{4} \right) \cup \left( -\frac{3}{2}, \infty \right)}.\]
From the factorization
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc),\]we know that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc.$
Since $a + b + c = 0,$ $c = -a - b,$ so
\begin{align*}
a^5 + b^5 + c^5 &= a^5 + b^5 - (a + b)^5 \\
&= -5a^4 b - 10a^3 b^2 - 10a^2 b^3 - 5ab^4 \\
&= -5ab(a^3 + 2a^2 b + 2ab^2 + b^3) \\
&= -5ab[(a^3 + b^3) + (2a^2 b + 2ab^2)] \\
&= -5ab[(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) + 2ab(a + b)] \\
&= -5ab(a + b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) \\
&= 5abc(a^2 + ab + b^2),
\end{align*}so
\[3abc = 5abc(a^2 + ab + b^2).\]Since $a,$ $b,$ $c$ are all nonzero, we can write
\[a^2 + ab + b^2 = \frac{3}{5}.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 &= a^2 + b^2 + (a + b)^2 \\
&= a^2 + b^2 + a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\
&= 2a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2 \\
&= 2(a^2 + ab + b^2) = \boxed{\frac{6}{5}}.
\end{align*}
Solving for $y$ in $5x + 8y = 10,$ we find $y = \frac{10 - 5x}{8}.$  Substituting into $x^2 + y^2 = 1,$ we get
\[x^2 + \left( \frac{10 - 5x}{8} \right)^2 = 1.\]This simplifies to $89x^2 - 100x + 36 = 0.$  The discriminant of this quadratic is $100^2 - 4 \cdot 89 \cdot 36 = -2816.$  Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots
Therefore, the line and circle intersect at $\boxed{0}$ points.
Since every root of $g(x)$ is a root of $f(x)$ (and these roots are distinct), $g(x)$ is a factor of $f(x).$  Furthermore, $g(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree 3, and $f(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree 4, so
\[x^4 + x^3 + bx^2 + 100x + c = (x^3 + ax^2 + x + 10)(x - r)\]for some real number $r.$  Expanding, we get
\[x^4 + x^3 + bx^2 + 100x + c = x^4 + (a - r) x^3 + (1 - ar) x^2 + (10 - r) x - 10r.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
a - r &= 1, \\
1 - ar &= b, \\
10 - r &= 100, \\
-10r &= c.
\end{align*}From the equation $10 - r = 100,$ $r = -90.$  Then $a = r + 1 = -89,$ so
\[f(x) = (x^3 - 89x^2 + x + 10)(x + 90),\]and $f(1) = (1 - 89 + 1 + 10)(1 + 90) = \boxed{-7007}.$
Let the roots of the cubic be $r$, $s$, and $t$
We are given that $\log_2 r + \log_2 s + \log_2 t = 4$
Using a property of logarithms, we can rewrite the equation as $\log_2(rst)=4$, or $rst=2^4=16$
Notice that this is just the product of the roots of the given polynomial
The product of the roots is also equal to $-\frac{a}{9}$
Thus, we have $-\frac{a}{9}=16$ and $a=\boxed{-144}$.
The given conditions are symmetric in $a,$ $b,$ and $c,$ so without loss of generality, we can assume that $a \le b \le c.$  Then $10 = a + b + c \le 3c,$ so $c \ge \frac{10}{3}.$  By AM-GM,
\[(a + b)^2 \ge 4ab.\]Then
\[(10 - c)^2 \ge 4(25 - ac - bc) = 100 - 4(a + b)c = 100 - 4(10 - c)c.\]This reduces to $3c^2 - 20c = c(3c - 20) \ge 0,$ so $c \le \frac{20}{3}.$
\[m = \min\{ab,ac,bc\} = ab = 25 - c(a + b) = 25 - c(10 - c) = (c - 5)^2.\]Since $\frac{10}{3} \le c \le \frac{20}{3},$ $m = ab \le \frac{25}{9}.$
Equality occurs when $a = b = \frac{5}{3}$ and $c = \frac{20}{3},$ so the maximum value of $m$ is $\boxed{\frac{25}{9}}.$
Since the polynomial has rational coefficients, it must also have $1-\sqrt{2}$ and $1-\sqrt{3}$ as roots
Then, the polynomial must be divisible by the two polynomials \[(x-(1+\sqrt2))(x-(1-\sqrt2)) = x^2-2x-1\]and \[(x-(1+\sqrt3))(x-(1-\sqrt3))=x^2-2x-2.\]It follows that the polynomial we seek is given by \[(x^2-2x-1)(x^2-2x-2) = \boxed{x^4-4x^3+x^2+6x+2}.\]
Dividing by $400,$ we get \[\frac{x^2}{20^2} + \frac{y^2}{10^2} = 1.\]Thus, the length of the major and minor axes are $2 \cdot 20 = 40$ and $2 \cdot 10 = 20,$ respectively
Then the distance between the foci of the ellipse is $\sqrt{40^2 - 20^2} = \boxed{20\sqrt3}.$
Let $a=11$, $b=13$, and $c=17$
Using these variables the expression becomes
$$  \frac{a^2 \left( \frac{1}{b} - \frac{1}{c} \right)
+ b^2 \left( \frac{1}{c} - \frac{1}{a} \right) + c^2 \left( \frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{b} \right)}{
a \left( \frac{1}{b} - \frac{1}{c} \right)
+ b \left( \frac{1}{c} - \frac{1}{a} \right) + c \left( \frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{b} \right)} \, .$$By grouping all the terms with the same reciprocal together we get
$$  \frac{\frac{1}{a}(c^2-b^2) + \frac{1}{b}(a^2-c^2) + \frac{1}{c}(b^2-a^2)}{\frac{1}{a}(c-b) + \frac{1}{b}(a-c) + \frac{1}{c}(b-a)} \, .$$Using the difference of squares, we can rewrite the numerator of the expression as
$$\frac{1}{a}(c+b)(c-b) + \frac{1}{b}(a+c)(a-c) + \frac{1}{c}(b+a)(b-a).$$Let $S = a + b + c$
Then the numerator is
$$\begin{aligned} &\frac{1}{a}(S-a)(c-b) + \frac{1}{b}(S-b)(a-b) + \frac{1}{c}(S-c)(b-a) \\
&=\frac{1}{a}(c-b)S - (c-b) + \frac{1}{b}(a-b)S - (a-c) + \frac{1}{c}(b-a)S-(b-a) \\
&= \left[ \frac{1}{a}(c-b)+ \frac{1}{b}(a-b) + \frac{1}{c}(b-a) \right]S
\end{aligned}$$But this is just the denominator of our fraction times $S$
So our original expression simplifies to $S$ which is $a+b+c = 11+13+17=\boxed{41}$.
We have that
\[f(f(-x)) = f(-f(x)) = -f(f(x)),\]so $f(f(x))$ is an $\boxed{\text{odd}}$ function.
The polynomial $x^4 + 1 = 0$ shows that $n$ can be 0
The polynomial $x(x^3 + 2)$ shows that $n$ can be 1.
The polynomial $x^2 (x^2 + 1)$ shows that $n$ can be 2.
The polynomial $x^4$ shows that $n$ can be 4.
Suppose the polynomial has three integer roots
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $-b,$ which is an integer
Therefore, the fourth root is also an integer, so it is impossible to have exactly three integer roots.
Thus, the possible values of $n$ are $\boxed{0, 1, 2, 4}.$
If $x = 2$ or $x = 4,$ then the fraction is undefined
Otherwise, we can cancel the factors of $(x - 2)(x - 4)(x - 2),$ to get
\[(x - 1)(x - 3)(x - 3)(x - 1) = 1.\]Then $(x - 1)^2 (x - 3)^2 - 1 = 0,$ so $[(x - 1)(x - 3) + 1][(x - 1)(x - 3) - 1] = 0.$
If $(x - 1)(x - 3) + 1 = 0,$ then $x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2 = 0.$  We have already ruled out $x = 2.$
If $(x - 1)(x - 3) - 1 = 0,$ then $x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,
\[x = 2 \pm \sqrt{2}.\]Thus, the solutions are $\boxed{2 + \sqrt{2}, 2 - \sqrt{2}}.$
Let $a = 2x,$ $b = y,$ and $c = 2z.$  Then $x = \frac{a}{2},$ $y = b,$ and $z = \frac{c}{2},$ so
\begin{align*}
\frac{4z}{2x + y} + \frac{4x}{y + 2z} + \frac{y}{x + z} &= \frac{2c}{a + b} + \frac{2a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{\frac{a}{2} + \frac{c}{2}} \\
&= \frac{2c}{a + b} + \frac{2a}{b + c} + \frac{2b}{a + c} \\
&= 2 \left (\frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{a + c} + \frac{c}{a + b} \right).
\end{align*}Let
\[S = \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{a + c} + \frac{c}{a + b}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
S + 3 &= \frac{a}{b + c} + 1 + \frac{b}{a + c} + 1 + \frac{c}{a + b} + 1 \\
&= \frac{a + b + c}{b + c} + \frac{a + b + c}{a + c} + \frac{a + b + c}{a + b} \\
&= (a + b + c) \left (\frac{1}{b + c} + \frac{1}{a + c} + \frac{1}{a + b} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} (2a + 2b + 2c) \left (\frac{1}{b + c} + \frac{1}{a + c} + \frac{1}{a + b} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} [(b + c) + (a + c) + (a + b)] \left (\frac{1}{b + c} + \frac{1}{a + c} + \frac{1}{a + b} \right).
\end{align*}By Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[[(b + c) + (a + c) + (a + b)] \left (\frac{1}{b + c} + \frac{1}{a + c} + \frac{1}{a + b} \right) \ge (1 + 1 + 1)^2 = 9,\]so
\[S \ge \frac{9}{2} - 3 = \frac{3}{2},\]and
\[\frac{4z}{2x + y} + \frac{4x}{y + 2z} + \frac{y}{x + z} \ge 2S = 3.\]Equality occurs when $a = b = c,$ or $2x = y = 2z,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{3}.$
Because $f(x)$ has real coefficients and $2i$ and $2+i$ are zeros, so are their conjugates $-2i$ and $2-i$
Therefore
\begin{align*}
f(x)=(x+2i)(x-2i)(x-(2+i))(x-(2-i))&=(x^2+4)(x^2-4x+5)\\
&=x^4-4x^3+9x^2-16x+20.
\end{align*}Hence $a+b+c+d=-4+9-16+20=\boxed{9}$.
In general,
\[\frac{x^2}{1 - x} = \frac{x^2 - x + x}{1 - x} = \frac{x(x - 1) + x}{1 - x} = \frac{x}{1 - x} - x,\]so
\begin{align*}
\frac{x_1^2}{1 - x_1} + \frac{x_2^2}{1 - x_2} + \dots + \frac{x_{100}^2}{1 - x_{100}} &= \frac{x_1}{1 - x_1} + \frac{x_2}{1 - x_2} + \dots + \frac{x_{100}}{1 - x_{100}} - (x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_{100}) \\
&= 1 - 1 \\
&= \boxed{0}.
\end{align*}
Rewriting the right-hand side under a common denominator, we have \[\frac{1}{x^2+1} > \frac{30+17x}{10x}.\]Then we can write \[\frac{1}{x^2+1} - \frac{30+17x}{10x} > 0,\]or \[\frac{-17x^3-30x^2-7x-30}{10x(x^2+1)} > 0.\]Multiplying both sides by $-10$ and flipping the inequality sign, we get \[\frac{17x^3+30x^2+7x+30}{x(x^2+1)} < 0.\]Looking for rational roots of the numerator, we see that $x=-2$ makes the numerator zero, so $x+2$ is a factor, by the factor theorem
Doing the polynomial division, we have \[17x^3 + 30x^2 + 7x + 30 = (x+2)(17x^2-4x+15),\]so \[\frac{(x+2)(17x^2-4x+15)}{x(x^2+1)} < 0.\]Since $x^2+1$ is positive for all real numbers $x$, it does not affect the sign on the left side
Similarly, since $y=17x^2-4x+15$ is the graph of a parabola that opens upward, and its disciminant is $4^2 - 4 \cdot 17 \cdot 15,$ which is negative, we see that $17x^2-4x+15 > 0$ for all $x.$ Therefore, the given inequality is equivalent to \[\frac{x+2}{x} < 0.\]Letting $f(x) = \frac{x+2}{x},$ we construct a sign table: \begin{tabular}{c|cc|c} &$x+2$ &$x$ &$f(x)$ \\ \hline$x<-2$ &$-$&$-$&$+$\\ [.1cm]$-2<x<0$ &$+$&$-$&$-$\\ [.1cm]$x>0$ &$+$&$+$&$+$\\ [.1cm]\end{tabular}Therefore, $f(x) < 0$ when $x \in \boxed{(-2, 0)}.$
Let $z = a + bi,$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers
Since $|z| = 2,$ $a^2 + b^2 = 4.$  Then
\begin{align*}
z + \frac{1}{z} &= a + bi + \frac{1}{a + bi} \\
&= a + bi + \frac{1}{a + bi} \\
&= a + bi + \frac{a - bi}{a^2 + b^2} \\
&= a + bi + \frac{a - bi}{4} \\
&= \frac{5}{4} a + \frac{3}{4} bi.
\end{align*}Let $x + yi = z + \frac{1}{z},$ so $x = \frac{5}{4} a$ and $y = \frac{3}{4} b.$  Then
\[\frac{x^2}{(5/4)^2} + \frac{y^2}{(3/4)^2} = a^2 + b^2 = 4,\]so
\[\frac{x^2}{(5/2)^2} + \frac{y^2}{(3/2)^2} = 1.\]Thus, $z + \frac{1}{z}$ traces an ellipse
The answer is $\boxed{\text{(C)}}.$
We notice that $x^3 - \frac{1}{x^3}$ is a difference of cubes
We can therefore factor it and rearrange the terms to get:  \begin{align*}
x^3 - \frac{1}{x^3} & = \left(x - \frac{1}{x}\right)\cdot\left(x^2 + x\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) + \frac{1}{x^2}\right) \\
& = \left(x - \frac{1}{x}\right)\cdot\left(\left(x^2 - 2x\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) + \frac{1}{x^2}\right) + 3x\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right) \\
& = \left(x - \frac{1}{x}\right)\cdot\left(\left(x - \frac{1}{x}\right)^2+3\right).
\end{align*}Since $x - \frac{1}{x} = 4$, we have that $x^3 - \frac{1}{x^3}=4\cdot(4^2+3) = 4 \cdot 19 = \boxed{76}.$
Here is a sequence of consecutive integers that add up to $2014$:
$$-2013, -2012, \dots , -1, 0, 1, \dots , 2012, 2013, 2014.$$So $-2013$ is yummy.
Assume there is a yummy integer less than $-2013$
Then there is a sequence of consecutive integers (including at least one less than $-2013$) that add up to $2014$
Let $A$ be the least integer in the sequence, so $A < -2013$.
Because the sum of the sequence is nonnegative, it includes the numbers $A, \dots, -1, 0, 1, \dots , -A$
Because the sum of the sequence is positive, besides the numbers above, it includes $-A + 1$
But $-A + 1 > 2013 + 1 = 2014.$
So the sum of the sequence exceeds $2014$, which is a contradiction
Hence there is no yummy integer less than $-2013$.
Therefore the least yummy integer is $\boxed{-2013}$.
By the change-of-base formula,
\[\log_{\sqrt{5}} (x^3 - 2) = \frac{\log_5 (x^3 - 2)}{\log_5 \sqrt{5}} = \frac{\log_5 (x^3 - 2)}{1/2} = 2 \log_5 (x^3 - 2),\]and
\[\log_{\frac{1}{5}} (x - 2) = \frac{\log_5 (x - 2)}{\log_5 \frac{1}{5}} = -\log_5 (x - 2),\]so the given equation becomes
\[2 \log_5 (x^3 - 2) = 4.\]Then $\log_5 (x^3 - 2) = 2,$ so $x^3 - 2 = 5^2 = 25.$  Then $x^3 = 27,$ so $x = \boxed{3}.$
Setting $x = y = 0,$ we get
\[f(0) = f(0)^2,\]so $f(0) = 0$ or $f(0) = 1.$  The constant functions $f(x) = 0$ and $f(x) = 1$ show that both $\boxed{0,1}$ are possible values of $f(x).$
From Vieta's relations, we have $p+q+r = 9$, $pq+qr+pr = 8$ and $pqr = -2$
So \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{p^2} + \frac{1}{q^2} + \frac{1}{r^2} = \frac{(pq + qr + rp)^2 - 2 (p + q + r)(pqr)}{(pqr)^2} = \frac{8^2 - 2 \cdot 9 \cdot (-2)}{(-2)^2} = \boxed{25}.
\end{align*}
Let $n$ be the degree of $p(x).$  Then the degree of $p(p(x))$ is $n^2,$ and the degree of $xp(x)$ is $n + 1.$
If $n \ge 2,$ then the degree of $xp(x) + x^2$ is $n + 1,$ which is strictly less than $n^2.$  Also, $p(x)$ clearly cannot be a constant polynomial, so the degree of $p(x)$ is $n = 1.$
Let $p(x) = ax + b.$  Then
\[p(p(x)) = p(ax + b) = a(ax + b) + b = a^2 x + ab + b,\]and
\[xp(x) + x^2 = x(ax + b) + x^2 = (a + 1) x^2 + bx.\]Equating coefficients, we get $a + 1 = 0,$ $a^2 = b,$ and $ab + b = 0.$  Then $a = -1$ and $b = 1,$ so $p(x) = \boxed{-x + 1}.$
We plot the lines $y = 2x + 2,$ $y = \frac{1}{2} x + 1,$ and $y = -\frac{3}{4} x + 7.$

The intersection of lines $y = 2x + 2$ and $y = \frac{1}{2} x + 1$ is $\left( -\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3} \right),$ and the intersection of lines $y = \frac{1}{2} x + 1$ and $y = -\frac{3}{4} x + 7$ is $\left( \frac{24}{5}, \frac{17}{5} \right).$
We can show that $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $\left( -\infty, \frac{24}{5} \right],$ and decreasing on the interval $\left[ \frac{24}{5}, \infty \right).$  Thus, the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $f \left( \frac{24}{5} \right) = \boxed{\frac{17}{5}}.$
Subtracting $c$ from the first equation and $c^2$ from the second, we get \[\begin{aligned} a+b &= 2-c, \\ a^2+b^2 &= 12-c^2
\end{aligned}\]By Cauchy-Schwarz, \[(1+1)(a^2+b^2)  = 2(a^2+b^2) \ge (a+b)^2.\]Substituting for $a+b$ and $a^2+b^2$ gives \[2(12-c^2) \ge (2-c)^2,\]which rearranges to \[3c^2 - 4c - 20 \le 0.\]This factors as \[(3c-10)(c+2) \le 0,\]so the maximum possible value of $c$ is $\tfrac{10}3$ (which occurs when $a = b = -\frac{2}{3}$) and the minimum possible value of $c$ is $-2$ (which occurs when $a = b = 2$)
Thus, the answer is $\tfrac{10}3 - (-2) = \boxed{\tfrac{16}3}.$
Let $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$ denote the two factors on the right-hand side, so that $P(x) = Q(x) \cdot R(x).$ By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of $Q(x)$ is $\tfrac{26}{2} = 13,$ and the sum of the roots of $R(x)$ is $\tfrac{80}{5} = 16$ (counting with multiplicity)
Therefore, the sum of the eight roots of $P(x)$ is $13 + 16 = 29.$
Each of the numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ must be one of those roots, so the remaining three roots, which must also come from the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\},$ must sum to $29 - (1+2+3+4+5) = 14.$ The only way this is possible is if the remaining three roots are $4, 5, 5.$ Therefore, the roots of $P(x)$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5$ (with multiplicity)
Since the leading coefficient of $P(x)$ is $2 \cdot 5 = 10,$ this means that \[P(x) = 10(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)^2(x-5)^3.\]Therefore, $P(6) = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 1^3 = \boxed{2400}.$
We compute the first few terms:
\[a_1 = 1, \quad a_2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad a_3 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad a_4 = \frac{3}{4}, \quad a_5 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad a_6 = \frac{1}{3}, \quad a_7 = \frac{2}{3}, \quad a_8 = \frac{1}{2}.\]The sequence appears to be converging to $\frac{1}{2}.$  In fact, every third term appears to be $\frac{1}{2}.$  So we can define a new sequence $(b_n)$ where $b_n = 2a_n - 1.$  Then $a_n = \frac{b_n + 1}{2}.$  Substituting, we get
\[\frac{b_n + 1}{2} = \frac{1 - \frac{1 + b_{n - 1}}{2}}{2 \cdot \frac{1 + b_{n - 2}}{2}}.\]This simplifies to
\[b_n = -\frac{b_{n - 1} + b_{n - 2}}{b_{n - 2} + 1}.\]Note that $b_1 = 1,$ $b_2 = 0,$ and $b_3 = -\frac{1}{2}.$
Suppose $b_n = 0.$  Then
\begin{align*}
b_{n + 1} &= -\frac{b_n + b_{n - 1}}{b_{n - 1} + 1} = -\frac{b_{n - 1}}{b_{n - 1} + 1}, \\
b_{n + 2} &= -\frac{b_{n + 1} + b_n}{b_n + 1} = -b_{n + 1} = \frac{b_{n - 1}}{b_{n - 1} + 1}, \\
b_{n + 3} &= -\frac{b_{n + 2} + b_{n + 1}}{b_{n + 1} + 1} = 0, \\
b_{n + 4} &= -\frac{b_{n + 2}}{b_{n + 2} + 1} = \frac{b_{n + 1}}{1 - b_{n + 1}}.
\end{align*}This tells us if $b_n = 0,$ then $b_{n + 3} = 0.$  Hence, $b_{3m - 1} = 0$ for all $m \ge 1.$
Furthermore, if $b_{n + 1} = -\frac{1}{k},$ then
\[b_{n + 4} = \frac{b_{n + 1}}{1 - b_{n + 1}} = \frac{-1/k}{1 + 1/k} = -\frac{1}{k + 1}.\]Hence, $b_6 = -\frac{1}{3},$ $b_9 = -\frac{1}{4},$ $b_{12} = -\frac{1}{5},$ and so on
In general,
\[b_{3m} = -\frac{1}{m + 1}.\]Then
\[a_{3m} = \frac{b_{3m} + 1}{2} = \frac{-1/(m + 1) + 1}{2} = \frac{m}{2(m + 1)}.\]In particular,
\[a_{120} = \frac{40}{2(40 + 1)} = \boxed{\frac{20}{41}}.\]
By the Binomial Theorem,
\[(1 + ix)^{2009} = 1 + \binom{2009}{1} ix - \binom{2009}{2} x^2 - \binom{2009}{3} ix^3 + \binom{2009}{4} x^4 + \dotsb.\]Also,
\[(1 - ix)^{2009} = 1 - \binom{2009}{1} ix - \binom{2009}{2} x^2 + \binom{2009}{3} ix^3 + \binom{2009}{4} x^4 + \dotsb.\]Adding the two, all the imaginary terms cancel, and we are left with the real terms:
\[(1 + ix)^{2009} + (1 - ix)^{2009} = 2 \left[ 1 - \binom{2009}{2} x^2 + \binom{2009}{4} x^4 + \dotsb \right].\]Then we can find the sum of the real terms by dividing by 2 and setting $x = 1$:
\[\frac{(1 + i)^{2009} + (1 - i)^{2009}}{2}.\]We can write
\begin{align*}
(1 + i)^{2009} &= (1 + i) (1 + i)^{2008} \\
&= (1 + i) ((1 + i)^2)^{1004} \\
&= (1 + i) (1 + 2i - 1)^{1004} \\
&= 2^{1004} (1 + i).
\end{align*}Similarly, $(1 - i)^{2009} = 2^{1004} (1 - i),$ so
\[\frac{(1 + i)^{2009} + (1 - i)^{2009}}{2} = \frac{2^{1004} (1 + i) + 2^{1004} (1 - i)}{2} = 2^{1004}.\]Therefore, $\log_2 S = \boxed{1004}.$
We have $|3-2i|\cdot |3+2i| = |(3-2i)(3+2i)| = |9 + 4| = \boxed{13}$.
We try to solve the two equations $x^2+4y^2=4$ and $x^2-m(y+2)^2=1$ simultaneously
To eliminate $x,$ we can subtract the second equation from the first equation, giving \[4y^2 + m(y+2)^2 = 3,\]or \[(m+4)y^2 + (4m) y +  (4m-3) = 0.\]For the ellipse and hyperbola to be tangent, this equation must have exactly one solution for $y,$ so its discriminant must be zero: \[(4m)^2 - 4(m+4)(4m-3) = 0,\]which simplifies to \[48 - 52m = 0.\]Thus, $m = \boxed{\frac{12}{13}}.$[asy]

The center of the hyperbola is $(3, 17).$ We also know that the distance from the center to each focus is $\sqrt{5^2+12^2}=13.$ Because the $x^2$ term has positive coefficient, the foci lie along the horizontal axis, so the two foci have coordinates $(3+13,17) = (16,17)$ and $(3-13,17) = (-10,17).$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{(16,17)}.$
Because the coefficients of the polynomial are rational, the radical conjugate $-1+4\sqrt2$ must also be a root of the polynomial
By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of this polynomial is $-31,$ and the product of these two roots is $(-1-4\sqrt2)(-1+4\sqrt2) = -31,$ so the remaining root must be $\frac{-31}{-31} = 1.$ Then by Vieta's formulas again, we have \[a = -[1 + (-1-4\sqrt2) + (-1+4\sqrt2)] = \boxed{1}.\]
Setting $x = 30$ and $y = \frac{4}{3},$ we get
\[f(40) = \frac{f(30)}{4/3} = \frac{20}{4/3} = \boxed{15}.\]
Rewriting the original equation: \begin{align*}
x^3-10x^2+25x&>0\\
\Rightarrow \quad x(x^2-10x+25)&>0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad x(x-5)^2&>0
\end{align*}If $x < 0,$ then $x(x - 5)^2 < 0,$ and if $x = 0,$ then $x(x - 5)^2 = 0.$
If $0 < x < 5,$ then $x(x - 5)^2 > 0.$  If $x = 5,$ then $x(x - 5)^2 = 0.$  If $x > 5,$ then $x(x - 5)^2 > 0.$  Therefore, the solution is
\[x \in \boxed{(0,5) \cup (5,\infty)}.\]
We can rewrite $AAA_4$ and $33_b$ to get \begin{align*}
16A+4A+A&=3b+3\quad\Rightarrow\\
21A&=3b+3.
\end{align*}The smallest possible value for $A$ is 1, which gives us $21=3b+3$ and $b=6$
So the smallest sum $A+b=\boxed{7}$
While there are other values for $A$ and $b$ that work, increasing $A$ will increase $b$, resulting in a larger sum.
For the product to be a perfect square, all the exponents need to be even
So we don't need to worry about factors that already have even exponents
We also don't need to worry about $9^9$ because $9$ is already a perfect square
The remaining factors are $3^35^57^7$.
To get even exponents in the product, we need at least one more $3$, at least one more $5$, and at least one more $7$
That would bring us up to $3^45^67^8$, and everything would be good
And indeed, $3\cdot5\cdot7=\boxed{105}$.
We have \begin{align*}
66666_{16} &= 6\cdot 16^4 + 6\cdot 16^3 + 6\cdot 16^2 + 6\cdot 16 + 6 \\
&= 6\cdot (16^4+16^3+16^2+16+1) \\
&= 6\cdot (2^{16}+2^{12}+2^8+2^4+1) \\
&= (2^2+2)\cdot (2^{16}+2^{12}+2^8+2^4+1) \\
&= 2^{18}+2^{17}+2^{14}+2^{13}+2^{10}+2^9+2^6+2^5+2^2+2.
\end{align*}Actually, this is more detail than necessary; what is important is that $2^{18} \le 66666_{16} < 2^{19}$, which tells us that the base-2 expression of this number has $\boxed{19}$ digits or bits (with place values $2^{18},2^{17},2^{16},\ldots,2^2,2^1,2^0$).
We use long division to find that the decimal representation of $\frac{3}{13}$ is $0.\overline{230769},$ which has a repeating block of 6 digits
So the repetend is $\boxed{230769}.$
$31_8=3\cdot8^1+1\cdot8^0=\boxed{25}$.
The last digit of a square must be either $1$, $4$, $5$, $6$, or $9$
Therefore, we only need to consider these squares
Only one square begins and ends with $1: 121$
Similarly, one square begins and ends with $4: 484$
No square begins and ends with $5$
One square begins and ends with $6: 676$
No square begins and ends with $9$
Therefore, there are $\boxed{3}$ squares which are $3$-digit palindromes.
The largest perfect square less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and the largest perfect cube less than 399 is $7^3=343$
Any perfect fourth power is already a square, so we may skip to the largest fifth power less than $399$, which is $3^5=243$, Again, a sixth power is a square (and a cube), so we look to the largest seventh power less than $399$, which is $2^7 = 128.$ Eighth, ninth and tenth powers may be skipped again because they would already have been included as perfect squares or cubes, and there is no eleventh power less than $399$ other than $1$
Thus the largest perfect power less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and $a+b=19+2=\boxed{21}$.
Since $a\equiv b^{-1}\pmod n$, \[ab\equiv b^{-1}b\equiv \boxed{1}\pmod n.\]
The numbers $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd or both even
However, they are also both prime, so they must both be odd
Therefore, one of $A$ and $B$ is odd and the other even
Because $A$ is a prime between $A-B$ and $A+B,$ $A$ must be the odd prime
Therefore, $B=2,$ the only even prime
So $A-2,$ $A,$ and $A+2$ are consecutive odd primes and thus must be $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ The sum of the four primes $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7$ is the prime number $17,$ so the correct answer is $\boxed{\text{(E)},}$ prime.
The sum of the digits of $\frac{1}{5^{{}^n}}$ that are to the right of the decimal point is the sum of the digits of the integer $\frac{10^n}{5^{{}^n}} = 2^n$, since multiplying by $10^n$ simply shifts all the digits $n$ places to the left
As a result, we start computing powers of 2, looking for an integer which has digits summing to a number greater than 10
\begin{align*}
2^1 &= 2 \\
2^2 &= 4 \\
2^3 &= 8 \\
2^4 &= 16 \\
2^5 &= 32 \\
2^6 &= 64 \\
2^7 &= 128
\end{align*}The sum of the digits in 128 is 11
The smallest positive integer $n$ such that the sum of the digits of $\frac{1}{5^{{}^n}}$ that are to the right of the decimal point is greater than 10 is $n = \boxed{7}$.
From the second fact, we know that $Z=K^3.$ $Z$ is a perfect square if $K^3$ is a perfect square, so $Z$ is the sixth power of some integer
Since $500<Z<1000,$ the only value of $Z$ that works is $Z=3^6=729.$ Thus, $K=\sqrt[3]{729}=\boxed{9}.$
A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$
The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$
The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$
Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$
This is satisfied only by $n=\boxed{5}$.
An integer that is congruent to $15 \pmod{22}$ is of the form $22n+15$.
Therefore, we make the equation $22n+15<10000$, and find the largest possible $n$
\begin{align*}
22n+15&<10000 \\
22n&<9985 \\
n&<\frac{9985}{22} \approx 453.85
\end{align*}The largest possible integer $n$ is $453$
We plug it in for $n$ to get $22 \cdot 453 +15 =\boxed{9981}$.
First, we convert the following numbers to base 10:  $$1357_{9}= 7\cdot9^{0}+5\cdot9^{1}+3\cdot9^{2}+1\cdot9^{3} = 7+45+243+729 = 1024_{10},$$$$100_{4} = 0\cdot4^{0}+0\cdot4^{1}+1\cdot4^{2} = 16_{10},$$$$2460_{8} = 0\cdot8^{0}+6\cdot8^{1}+4\cdot8^{2}+2\cdot8^{3} = 48+256+1024 = 1328_{10},\quad\text{and}$$$$5678_{9} = 8\cdot9^{0}+7\cdot9^{1}+6\cdot9^{2}+5\cdot9^{3} = 8+63+486+3645 = 4202_{10}.$$So the original expression equals $\frac{1024}{16}-1328+4202 = \boxed{2938}.$
Note that $235935623_{74}=3+2(74)+6(74)^2+5(74)^3+3(74)^4+9(74)^5+5(74)^6$ $+3(74)^7+2(74)^8$
But $74 \equiv -1 \mod{15}$, so this is just $3-2+6-5+3-9+5-3+2=0 \mod{15}$, so $a=\boxed{0}$.
An even number has a units digit of 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, so the smallest digit not in that list of possible units digits is $\boxed{1}$.
To have a digit sum of 19, we need at least a 3-digit prime, since the maximum digit sum for 2-digit numbers is $9 + 9 = 18$
The smallest such prime will have first digit 1, so a possible candidate is 199, the only number with hundreds digit 1 and digit sum 19
We just need to check that this number is a prime
We note that since $\sqrt{199}$ is between 14 and 15, we only have to check divisibility by integers through 14
Actually, we don't have to check every such integer: it's enough to check divisibility by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13
(If it's not divisible by 2, it's not divisible by 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14; similarly, if it's not divisible by 3, it's not divisible by 6, 9, or 12.) 199 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2
Its digit sum is 19, which is not divisible by 3, so 199 isn't divisible by 3
199 doesn't end in 5 or 0, so it's not divisible by 5
199 has alternating digit sum $1 - 9 + 9 =1$, which isn't divisible by 11, so it's not divisible by 11
We can check that 199 isn't divisible by 7 or 13 just by division, after which we can conclude that $\boxed{199}$ is the prime we're looking for.
Starting with the the rightmost column would be the easiest (we'll call it the first, the second rightmost column the second, and so on)
Let's consider the possible values for $E$ first.
Since the values must be non-zero, we'll start with $1$
If $E$ is $1$, then $S$ would be $2$ and nothing would carry over
However, since $H+H$ must equal $E$ if nothing carries over and $H$ must be an integer, $E$ can not equal $1$.
If $E$ equals $2$, then $S$ must equal $4$
$H$ would then equal $1$
This satisfies our original equation as shown: $$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &4&1&2_5\\ &+&1&2_5\\ \cline{2-4} &4&2&4_5\\ \end{array}$$Thus, $S+H+E=4+1+2=7$
In base $5$, the sum is then $\boxed{12_5}$.
Note: The other possible values for $E$ can also be checked
If $E$ equaled $3$, the residue $S$ would then equal $1$ and $1$ would be carried over
Since nothing carries over into the third column, $1+H+H$ would then have to equal $3$
However, $H$ can not equal $1$ because the digits must be distinct.
If $E$ equaled $4$, the residue $S$ would then equal $3$ and $1$ would be carried over
$1+H+H$ would then have to equal $4$, but $H$ can not be a decimal
Therefore, the above solution is the only possible one.
Since there are 7 days in a week, Lucy's 1st day, 8th day, 15th day, 22nd day, etc
were on Wednesday
When $1000$ is divided by $7$, the remainder is $6$
Therefore, the 1002nd day was a Wednesday (since 1002 is one more than a multiple of 7)
So the 1000th day, was two days earlier on a $\boxed{\text{Monday}}$.
The prime numbers less than $10$ are $2,3,5,7$, so the sum is $2+3+5+7=\boxed{17}$.
Looking at the $d$'s place, we see that $A_d + A_d = 16_d = d + 6$ or $A_d + A_d + 1 = 16_d = d + 6$ (if there is carry-over)
Re-arranging and solving for $A_d$, we find that $A_d = \frac{d + 6}2$ or $A_d = \frac{d + 5}2$
In either case, since $d > 6$, it follows that $A_d > 2$
Thus, when we add the units digits $B_d + A_d$, there must be carry-over, so $A_d = \frac{d + 5}2$
It follows that $$B_d + A_d = d + 2 \Longrightarrow B_d = d+2 - \frac{d + 5}2 = \frac d2 - \frac 12.$$Thus, $A_d - B_d = \frac{d + 5}2 - \frac{d-1}{2} = \boxed{3}_d$.
If $x$ members march in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=72=2^3\cdot3^2$
Given that $5\le x\le20$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^3=8$, $2^2\cdot3=12$, $2\cdot3=6$, $2\cdot3^2=18$ and $3^2=9$, for a total of $ \boxed{5}$ row-lengths.
From the middle column, we see that $A_6+4_6=13_6$, so $A+4=1\cdot6+3=9$ and $A=5$
Since the rightmost column tells us that $B_6+1_6=A_6$, $B=5-1=4$
Therefore, $A+B=5+4=\boxed{9}$.
Let $c$ and $f$ be the number of 3 cent stamps and 4 cent stamps that Bryan can use, respectively
We have $3c+4f=33$
To minimize $c+f$, we must minimize the number of 3 cent stamps used
Since $f$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $c$ is $c=3$, in which case $4f=33-3c=33-3\times3=24\Rightarrow f=6$
The least value is therefore $c+f=3+6=\boxed{9}$ stamps.
If there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$, those two multiples must be $x$ and $2x$
Therefore, $2x$ must be less than $100$, while $3x$ the next largest multiple of $x$, must be at least $100$ (or else there would be $3$, not $2$ multiples in the two-digit range).
It may take some trial and error to find the smallest and largest possible values of $x$ under these conditions
The smallest is $x=34$, because $3x=102$, the smallest three-digit multiple of $3$
If we tried anything smaller than $34$, $x$, $2x$, and $3x$ would all have two digits, and that doesn't satisfy the condition.
The largest possible value of $x$ is $49$, because if $x$ were $50$, $2x$ would equal $100$, and only one multiple of $x$ would have two digits
Every value of $x$ from $34$ to $49$ works.
Now, we must count the number of integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive
This is a surprisingly tricky process: you might think there should be $49-34$, or $15$ possible values of $x$, but that's not actually right!  Suppose we subtract $33$ from each number
Then we are counting the numbers from $1$ to $16,$ and so there are $\boxed{16}$ integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive.
We have that $22_b = 2b + 2$ and $514_b = 5b^2 + b + 4$
Hence, $(2b + 2)^2 = 5b^2 + b + 4$, which simplifies to $b^2 - 7b = 0$
This equation factors as $b(b - 7) = 0$, so $b = \boxed{7}$.
Note that, modulo 6, $35 \equiv -1$ and $16 \equiv 4$
Therefore, $35^{1723} - 16^{1723} \equiv (-1)^{1723} - 4^{1723} \equiv -1 - 4^{1723}$
Note that $4^2 \equiv 4$ modulo 6, so $-1 - 4^{1723} \equiv -1 - 4 \equiv -5 \equiv \boxed{1}$ modulo 6.
The given information can be expressed by writing $x\equiv 9^{-1}\pmod{25}$
Thus we wish to compute $11+9^{-1}\pmod{25}$.
Modulo $25$, we can write $11$ as $11\cdot (9\cdot 9^{-1}) \equiv (11\cdot 9)\cdot 9^{-1} \equiv 99\cdot 9^{-1}$
Thus \begin{align*}
11 + 9^{-1} &\equiv 99\cdot 9^{-1} + 1\cdot 9^{-1} \\
&\equiv 100\cdot 9^{-1} \\
&\equiv 0\cdot 9^{-1} \\
&\equiv 0\pmod{25},
\end{align*}so the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$ is $\boxed{0}$.
Notice that the trick we used here is analogous to using a common denominator to add fractions.
First, we factor $5!$ into primes: \begin{align*} 5! &= 5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1\\ &= 2^{3}\cdot3\cdot5
\end{align*} Then, we factor $\frac{8!}{3!}.$ \begin{align*} \frac{8!}{3!} &= 8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4\\ &= 2^{6}\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7
\end{align*} We can find the greatest common factor by taking the lowest exponent of each common prime factor
We get $2^{3}\cdot3\cdot5 = \boxed{120}.$
We know that $4^{4}>123_{10}>4^{3}$
So, we can tell that $123_{10}$ in base four will have four digits
$4^{3}=64$, which can go into 123 only one time at most, leaving $123-1\cdot64 = 59$ for the next three digits
$4^{2}=16$ goes into 59 three times at most, leaving us with $59-3\cdot16 = 11$
Then, $4^{1}=4$ goes into 11 two times at most, leaving $11-2\cdot4 = 3$ for the ones digit
All together, the base four equivalent of $123_{10}$ is $\boxed{1323_{4}}$.
$175=5^2\cdot7^1$
To arrange the divisors of 175, we can (conveniently) start with the divisor 7
Since $\gcd(5,7)=1$, the two divisors that are adjacent to 7 must be multiples of 7, which means they have to be $5^1\cdot7=35$ and $5^2\cdot7=175$
Thus, the sum of the two integers adjacent to 7 is $35+175=\boxed{210}$.
If $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, then $n-1$ is divisible by all of those integers
In other words, $n-1$ is a multiple of the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
Prime factorizing 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we find that their least common multiple is $2^2\cdot 3\cdot 5=60$
Thus the possible values for an integer $n$ which is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 61, 121, 181, 241, 301 and so on
Checking them one at a time, we find that the least of these integers which is divisible by 7 is $\boxed{301}$.
We convert to base 10 to obtain  \[43210_{6}=4\cdot6^4+3\cdot6^3+2\cdot6^2+1\cdot6^1+0\cdot6^0=5910.\]\[3210_{7}=3\cdot7^3+2\cdot7^2+1\cdot7^1+0\cdot7^0=1134.\]Therefore, $5910-1134=\boxed{4776}$.
Carry out the multiplication as you would with base $10$
There is no need to carry during the multiplication with base $2$.
$$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&&&1&0&1&0&1_2\\ &&&&&\times&1&0&1_2\\ \cline{2-9} &&&_1&1^{\text{ }}&0^1&1^{\text{ }}&0^{\text{ }}&1^{\text{ }}_2\\ &+&1^{\text{ }}&0^{\text{ }}&1&0_{\text{ }}&1&0&0_2\\ \cline{2-9} &&1&1&0&1&0&0&1_2\\ \end{array}$$Add it up for a final answer of $\boxed{1101001_2}$.
If the $24$th is a Saturday, the $17$th was also a Saturday, as were the $10$th and the $3$rd
So the $2$nd was a Friday and the $1$st was a $\boxed{\text{Thursday}}$.
There are $60$ seconds in a minute
When $6666$ is divided by $60$, you get $111$ with a remainder of $6$ seconds
Therefore, $6666$ seconds is $111$ minutes and $6$ seconds
There are $60$ minutes in an hour
When you divide $111$ by $60$, you get $1$ with a remainder of $51$
Thus, $6666$ seconds is equivalent to $1$ hour $51$ minutes and $6$ seconds
Therefore, the time in $6666$ seconds is $\boxed{4\!:\!51\!:\!06 \text{ p.m.}}$
We start subtract the rightmost digits, keeping in mind that we are in base $8$.
Since $5$ is less than $7$, we must borrow $1$ from the $2$, which then becomes $1$
Since $15_8-7_8=6_8$, we have $6$ in the rightmost digit
Since the $1$ left over is less than $3$, we must borrow $1$ from the $3$, which becomes a $2$
$11_8-3_8=6_8$, so we have $6$ in the second rightmost digit
Since $2-2=0$, the third rightmost digit is 0
In the usual notation, this process looks like $$ \begin{array}{c@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \cancelto{2}{3}& \cancelto{1}{2} & 5_8\\ & & - & 2 & 3 & 7_8\\ \cline{2-6} & & & & 6& 6_8\\ \end{array}$$Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{66_8}$.
We see that the given number is equal to $1 \cdot n^3 + 1 = n^3 + 1$
Using the sum of cubes factorization, it follows that $n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$
Since $1$ is a digit in the base, then $n > 1$, and $n+1 > 1$ and $n^2 - n + 1 > n - n + 1 = 1$, so $n^3 + 1$ is the product of two integers greater than $1$
Thus, $1001_n$ is prime for $\boxed{0}$ values of $n$.
Setting up the subtraction and borrowing as shown: $$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&&&\\ &\cancelto{0}{1}&\cancelto{6}{0}&\cancelto{6}{0}&{\cancelto{7}{0}}_{7}\\ &-&6&6&6_7\\ \cline{2-5} &&&&1_7.\\ \end{array}$$So the difference is $\boxed{1_7}$.
We know that $18=9\cdot2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2
In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9
Thus, $7+1+2+n$, or $10+n$, must be divisible by 9
Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $n=18-10=\boxed{8}$.
If $2n$ is a perfect square, then $n$ must be divisible by 2
Now if $3n$ is a perfect cube and $n$ is divisible by 2, then $n$ must be divisible by $3^2=9$ and by $2^3=8$
Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube is $9\times8=\boxed{72}$.
Since $247, 39,$ and $143$ are all divisible by $13$, the residues for $247+ 5 \cdot 39 + 7 \cdot 143$ is just $0$.
Therefore, $247+5 \cdot 39 + 7 \cdot 143 +4 \cdot 15 \equiv 4 \cdot 15 \equiv 60 \equiv \boxed{8} \pmod{13}$.
We write $2dd5_6$ in base 10 to get $2dd5_6=2\cdot 6^3+d\cdot 6^2 +d\cdot 6 + 5= 437 + 42d$
We can subtract $39\cdot 11$ from this quantity without changing whether it is divisible by 11
This subtraction yields $437 + 42d-429 = 8 + 42d$
We can subtract $33d$ from this quantity, again not changing whether it is divisible by 11, leaving $8+9d$
Now we try the possible values $d=0,1,2,3,4,5$ for a base-6 digit, and we find that only $d=\boxed{4}$ results in a number which is divisible by 11.
The prime factorization of $225$ is $225 = 15^2 = 3^2 \times 5^2$
Since $2$ does not divide into $225$, we treat $2$ as having a $0$ exponent; the next two primes are $3$ and $5$
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{220}.$
$10101_3 = 1 \cdot 3^4 + 0 \cdot 3^3 + 1 \cdot 3^2 + 0 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 81 + 9 + 1 = \boxed{91}$.
Calculate the remainders when $1^2$, $2^2$, ..., $10^2$ are divided by 11 and sum them to find that the remainder when $1^2+2^2+\cdots+10^2$ is divided by 11 is the same as that of $1+4+9+5+3+3+5+9+4+1=44$, which is $\boxed{0}$.
Observing that neither $957$ nor $1537$ can be divided by $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ or $7,$ we turn to the Euclidean algorithm
We get \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}(957,1537) &= \text{gcd}(957, 1537 - 957) \\
&= \text{gcd}(957,580) \\
&= \text{gcd}(580, 957 -580) \\
&= \text{gcd}(580,377) \\
&= \text{gcd}(377,580-377) \\
&= \text{gcd}(377,203) \\
&= \text{gcd}(203,174) \\
&= \text{gcd}(174,203-174) \\
&= \text{gcd}(174,29) \\
&= \boxed{29}.
\end{align*}Remark: Note that we could have computed $\text{gcd}(957,580)$ more quickly by observing that  \[
\text{957 is divisible by neither 2 nor 5}\]\[ \implies \text{gcd}(957,580)=\text{gcd}(957,58).
\]The greatest common divisor of 957 and 58 can be calculated using the Euclidean algorithm in one step: long division gives $957 \div 58 = 16\text{ remainder }29$.
In any base, $11 = 10+1$, so we can think of $11^4$ as $(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)$
Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10)
Put another way, when we multiply out $11\times 11\times 11\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.
However, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$
So the answer is $b=\boxed{6}$.
The largest Mersenne Prime less than 200 is $2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = \boxed{127}$
The next possible Mersenne Prime, $2^{11} - 1 = 2047$, is much too large (and is not prime).
Recall that the number of whole number divisors of a positive integer can be determined by prime factorizing the integer, adding 1 to each of the exponents, and multiplying the results
If a positive integer has 10 factors, then the set of exponents in the prime factorization is $\{1,4\}$ or $\{9\}$
For each set of exponents, the smallest positive integer whose prime factorization has the given set of exponents is achieved by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes 2, 3, 5, etc
The smallest positive integer with an exponent of 9 in the prime factorization is $2^9=512$
The smallest positive integer whose prime factorization has exponents 1 and 4 is $2^4\cdot 3^1=48$
Since $48<512$, $\boxed{48}$ is the smallest positive integer with 10 positive integer divisors.
Let $m = 121^2 + 233^2 + 345^2$ and $n = 120^2 + 232^2 + 346^2$
By the Euclidean Algorithm, and using the difference of squares factorization, \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,(m,n) &= \text{gcd}\,(m-n,n) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(n,121^2 - 120^2 + 233^2 - 232^2 + 345^2 - 346^2)\\
&= \text{gcd}\,(n,(121-120)(121+120) \\
&\qquad\qquad\qquad + (233-232)(233+232)\\
&\qquad\qquad\qquad - (346-345)(346+345)) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(n,241 + 465 - 691) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(n,15)
\end{align*}We notice that $120^2$ has a units digit of $0$, $232^2$ has a units digit of $4$, and $346^2$ has a units digit of $6$, so that $n$ has the units digit of $0+4+6$, namely $0$
It follows that $n$ is divisible by $5$
However, $n$ is not divisible by $3$: any perfect square not divisible by $3$ leaves a remainder of $1$ upon division by $3$, as $(3k \pm 1)^2 = 3(3k^2 + 2k) + 1$
Since $120$ is divisible by $3$ while $232$ and $346$ are not, it follows that $n$ leaves a remainder of $0 + 1 + 1 = 2$ upon division by $3$
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{5}$.
Let $23a$ be the multiple we seek
Thus $$23a\equiv 4\pmod{89}.$$ Multiplying both sides of this equation by $4$, then reducing modulo $89$, gives: \begin{align*}
92a &\equiv 16 \pmod{89} \\
3a &\equiv 16 \pmod{89}
\end{align*} Multiplying both sides by $30$, then reducing again, gives: \begin{align*}
90a &\equiv 480 \pmod{89} \\
a &\equiv 480-445 = 35 \pmod{89}
\end{align*} All of these steps are reversible, so $35$ is the unique solution $\pmod{89}$ to the original congruence
The smallest positive solution is $a=35$, giving $23a=\boxed{805}$
(Indeed, we can check that $805 = 9\cdot 89 + 4$.)
We can simplify the congruence as follows (all of the following congruences are equivalent):
\begin{align*}
34x+6&\equiv 2\pmod {20}\\
14x+6&\equiv 2\pmod {20}\\
14x&\equiv 16\pmod {20}\\
7x&\equiv 8\pmod {10}\\
21x&\equiv 8\cdot 3\pmod {10}\\
x&\equiv 24\pmod{10}\\
x&\equiv 4\pmod{10}\\
x&\equiv \boxed{-6}\pmod{10}.
\end{align*}
Note that $60$ is divisible by $3$, but $20$ is not divisible by $3$
Therefore, if $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[\nu,20]=60$, then $\nu$ must be divisible by 3 and we may write $\nu=3n$ (where $n$ is a positive integer).
Thus we have $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[3n,20]=60$, and since the $3n$ contributes the factor of $3$ to $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[3n,20]$, it follows that $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n,20]=\frac{60}{3}=20$
This is true if and only if $n$ is a divisor of $20$
Therefore, the possible values of $\nu$ are $3$ times the positive divisors of $20$: $$\nu = 3,6,12,15,30,\,\text{or}\,60.$$The sum of these values is $\boxed{126}$.
The largest power of 2 that divides $199$ is $2^7$, which equals 128
Since $(1\cdot 2^7)=128<199<(2\cdot 2^7)=256$, the digit in the $2^7$ place is $1$
We know that $199-128=71$, and that $71$ can be expressed as $64+4+2+1$, or $(1\cdot 2^6)+(1\cdot 2^2)+(1\cdot 2^1)+(1\cdot 2^0)$
This means that $199_{10}=11000111_2$
Therefore, $x=3$ and $y=5$; and $y-x=5-3=\boxed{2}$.
Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\ldots$
The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01
Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4)
Since $2005\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \boxed{0}$.
We let our integer be $n$
the first sentence tells us that  \[n\equiv 7\pmod {15}.\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \begin{align*}
n&\equiv7\equiv1\pmod3\\
n&\equiv7\equiv2\pmod5.
\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\boxed{3}$.
If $n$ is the number of people in the incoming class, then $n$ yields a remainder of $14$ when divided by $21$
Since both 21 and 14 are divisible by 7, this means that $n$ is divisible by $7$
Define $k=n/7$, and note that $7k \equiv 14\pmod{21}$
Dividing by 7, we get $k\equiv 2\pmod{3}$
Multiplying by 7 again, we get $n\equiv 14\pmod{3}$, which implies $n\equiv 2\pmod{3}$
So we are looking for a solution to the following system of linear congruences: \begin{align*}
n&\equiv 0 \pmod{7}, \\
n&\equiv 2 \pmod{3},\\
n&\equiv 22 \pmod{23}
\end{align*} First, we look for a solution to the last two congruences
Checking numbers that are one less than a multiple of 23, we find that 68 satisfies $n\equiv 2\pmod{3}$
By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $n$ which satisfy both of the last two congruences are precisely those that differ from 68 by a multiple of $3\cdot 23=69$
Checking $68+69$, $68+2\cdot 69$, etc
we find that $68 + 5\cdot 69 = \boxed{413}$ is the least positive solution to the last two congruences which is also divisible by 7
Note that, by the Chinese remainder theorem again, the solutions of the above system of three congruences are precisely the positive integers that differ from 413 by a multiple of $7\cdot3\cdot23=483,$ so 413 is indeed the only solution between 0 and 500.
We carry out the multiplication as we carry out multiplication in base $10$
Fortunately, we do not have to worry about carrying over, since we are only multiplying by digits of $0$ or $1$
Thus:  $$ \begin{array}{@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& & & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1_2 \\
& & & \times & 1 & 0 & 1_2 \\
\cline{4-7} & & & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1_2 \\
& & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0_2 \\
+ & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0_2 \\ \cline{1-7}
& 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1_2 \\
\end{array}$$When summing, we need to carry-over for the second digit from the left
Thus, the sum is equal to $\boxed{110111}_2$.
Divisibility by $33$ requires that a number be divisible by both $11$ and $3$
If a five-digit number is divisible by $11$, the difference between the sum of the units, hundreds and ten-thousands digits and the sum of the tens and thousands digits must be divisible by $11$
Thus $(7 + 9 + 3) - (n + 3) = 16 - n$ must be divisible by $11$
The only digit which can replace $n$ for the number to be divisible by $11$, then, is $n = 5$
Furthermore, if a number is $7 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 3 = 27$, so the number is divisible by $3$
Hence, $n = \boxed{5}$.
The one-digit prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7
A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3
So we want to count the number of ways we can pick three or fewer of these digits that add up to a multiple of 3 and form a number with them
We will use modular arithmetic
Of our allowable digits, $3 \equiv 0$, $7 \equiv 1$, $2\equiv 2 \pmod{3}$, and $5 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$
The ways to add up 3 or fewer numbers to get 0 modulo 3 are shown:
0 + 0 + 0
1 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 2
0 + 1 + 2
We will count the number of 3-primable integers each case produces:
There is 1 number, 3.
There is 1 number, 33.
One of the digits is 7, and the other digit is either 2 or 5
So there are 2 choices for this digit, and once the digit is chosen, there are 2 ways to arrange the digits of the 3-primable number (for example, if we choose the digit 2, then we could either have 72 or 27)
So there are $(2)(2) = 4$ numbers in this case.
There is 1 number, 333.
There is 1 number, 777.
Each of the three digits is either 2 or 5
This gives $2^3 = 8$ numbers.
One of the digits is 3, one of the digits is 7, and the other digit is either 2 or 5
Once we choose either 2 or 5, there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the digits of the 3-primable number
So there are $2(6) = 12$ numbers in this case.
So in total, our answer is $1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 12 = \boxed{28}$.
If $n$ has $3$ divisors, since it is divisible by both $1$ and $n$, the only possibility for a third unique divisor is $\sqrt{n}$, which must be prime
Therefore, $n$ is the square of a prime number
As a result, $n^2$ is the fourth power of a prime
Let $n^2 = p^4$ for the prime $p$
There are $\boxed{5}$ divisors of $p^4$, namely $p^0$, $p^1$, $p^2$, $p^3$, and $p^4$.
$ 2002 = 2^1 \cdot 7^1 \cdot 11^1 \cdot 13^1 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad t(2002) = (1 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = \boxed{16}
Using long division, we find that $\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\overline{153846}$.
After the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block
We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit
The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$
Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\boxed{3}$.
Any number in $S$ has a leftmost (eights) digit that is equal to $1$
The remaining three digits can either be $0$ or $1$, so there are a total of $2^3 = 8$ elements in $S$
Notice that element $x$ in $S$ can be paired with another element $10111_2-x$, which is the base $2$ number whose right-most three digits are the opposite of those of $x$
Thus, the sum of the elements in $S$ is equal to $4 \times 10111_2 = 100_2 \times 10111_2 = \boxed{1011100}_2$.
Using long division, we find that $10,\!000$ divided by 15 yields a quotient of 666 with a remainder of 10
Thus $10,\!005$ is a multiple of 15, and $\boxed{10,\!010}$ is the least five-digit integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15)
For confirmation, note that $10,\!010-15=9,\!995$ is the next-highest integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15).
We begin by converting $403_{10}$ into base-7
Since $7^3=343$ is the largest power of 7 that is less than 403, and it can go into the given number once, the coefficient of the $7^3$ term will be 1
From here, we are left with a remainder of $403-343=60$
The largest power of 7 less than this number is $7^2=49$, and the largest multiple of 49 that is less than 60 is $1\cdot49=49$ itself
This leaves us with $60-49=11$, which we can express as $1\cdot7^1+4\cdot7^0$
So, we find that $403_{10}=1\cdot7^3+1\cdot7^2+1\cdot{7^1}+4\cdot7^0=1114_7$, which only has $\boxed{1}$ even digit.
Note that $173 \equiv 23\pmod{50}$ and $927\equiv 27\pmod{50}$
Therefore, \begin{align*}
173\cdot 927 &\equiv 23\cdot 27 \\
&= 621 \\
&\equiv \boxed{21}\quad\pmod{50}.
\end{align*}
First we note that the four integers are $1,3,5,7$
Then we expand to get \[(abc+abd+acd+bcd)(abcd)^{-1}=a^{-1}+b^{-1}+c^{-1}+d^{-1}.\]Finally, we see that (amazingly) each of the four numbers is its own inverse modulo $8$
Thus,  \[1^{-1}+3^{-1}+5^{-1}+7^{-1}\equiv 1+3+5+7\equiv 16\equiv \boxed{0} \pmod 8.\]
In $f(x)$, all terms will have a multiple of $x$ except for the constant term, which is the multiple of the four constants $4,1,6$, and $9$.
Recall (from the Euclidean algorithm) that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $a-kb$ where $k,a,$ and $b$ are any integers
Therefore, finding the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is the same as finding the greatest common divisor of $x$ and the constant term of $f(x)$
Therefore, we want to find \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,((3x+4)(7x+1)(13x+6)(2x+9),x) &=\text{gcd}\,(4 \cdot 1 \cdot 6 \cdot 9, x)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(216,x)
\end{align*}Since $15336$ is a multiple of $216$, the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is $\boxed{216}$.
To make a number as large as possible, we want as many digits as possible, so we want the digits to be as small as possible
To have the most number of digits, we use 4 twos and 1 three to make $4 \cdot 2 +3 =11$
We want to arrange them in decreasing order because we want the digits to the left to be as large as possible
Therefore, we have the number $\boxed{32222}$.
If two numbers give the same remainder when divided by 5, they are said to be equivalent, modulo 5
From $n^2$ to $n^3$, we have multiplied by $n$
Since $n^2$ is equivalent to 4 (modulo 5), and $n^3$ is equivalent to 2 (modulo 5), we are looking for an integer $n$ for which $4\cdot n$ is equivalent to 2, modulo 5
Notice that if $n$ is greater than 4, then we can replace it with its remainder when divided by 5 without changing whether it satisfies the condition
Therefore, we may assume that $0\leq n <5$
Trying 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, we find that only $\boxed{3}$ times 4 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.
For $n = 1,$ $f(1) = 1,$ so
\[f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1.\]Thus, $n = 1$ does not satisfy $f(f(n)) = n + 2.$  Henceforth, assume that $n \ge 2$.
Since $1$ and $n$ always divide $n$, we have that $f(n) \ge n+1$, so $f(f(n)) \ge n+2$
Therefore, in order for $n$ to be superdeficient, $f(n) = n+1$ and $f(n+1) = n+2$
However, if $f(k) = k+1$, then $k$ must be prime
Therefore, we are searching for consecutive prime integers
However, one of those primes must necessarily be even, and the only even prime is $2$
Note that $f(2) = 3$ and $f(3) = 4$, so there is exactly $\boxed{1}$ superdeficient number: $2$.
Since $11065,11067,11069,\ldots,11077$ are $7$ consecutive odd integers, they include exactly one integer from each of the residue classes $1,3,5,7,9,11,13\pmod{14}$ (not necessarily in that order)
Therefore, their sum is congruent $\pmod{14}$ to $1+3+5+7+9+11+13=49$
The remainder of this sum $\pmod{14}$ is $\boxed{7}$.
In the rightmost column there is no carrying, so our base must be greater than 5
However, in the next column we see that $6_{b}+3_{b}=11_{b}$
This tells us that $b$ divides into 9 once, with a remainder 1
Therefore, $b=\boxed{8}$.
We would like to find $3124_{5}+3122_{5}+124_{5}$.
$3124_{5} = 4\cdot5^{0}+2\cdot5^{1}+1\cdot5^{2}+3\cdot5^{3} = 4+10+25+375 = 414$
$3122_{5} = 2\cdot5^{0}+2\cdot5^{1}+1\cdot5^{2}+3\cdot5^{3} = 2+10+25+375 = 412$
$124_{5} = 4\cdot5^{0}+2\cdot5^{1}+1\cdot5^{2} = 4+10+25 = 39$
Summing all of these together yields $414+412+39= \boxed{865}$ dollars.
Since $4 \cdot 9 = 36 \equiv 1 \pmod{35}$, $4^{-1} \equiv \boxed{9} \pmod{35}$.
We notice that in the units column, it's impossible for $\triangle+2=1_6$
So, it must be the case that $\triangle+2=11_6=7$
That would mean $\triangle=7-2=\boxed{5}$
We can check that our answer works by plugging our value for triangle into the original problem: $$ \begin{array}{c@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 3 & 2 & 1 & 5_6\\ & & & 5 & 4 & 0_6\\ &+ & & & 5 & 2_6\\ \cline{2-6} & & 4 & 2 & 5 & 1_6.\\ \end{array} $$The addition problem still works, so our answer is correct.
First, we note that $55$, $165$, and $260$ all have a common factor of $5$: \begin{align*}
55 &= 5\cdot 11\\
165 &= 5\cdot 33\\
260 &= 5\cdot 52
\end{align*}An integer $n$ satisfies $55n\equiv 165\pmod{260}$ if and only if it satisfies $11n\equiv 33\pmod{52}$
(Make sure you see why!)
Now it is clear that $n=3$ is a solution
Moreover, since $11$ and $52$ are relatively prime, the solution is unique $\pmod{52}$
If you don't already know why this is the case, consider that we are looking for $n$ such that $11n-33=11(n-3)$ is divisible by $52$; this is true if and only if $n-3$ is divisible by $52$.
Hence all solutions are of the form $3+52k$, where $k$ is an integer
One such solution which is easy to compute is $3+52(20) = 1043$
The next-largest solution is $1043-52 = 991$, so the largest three-digit solution is $\boxed{991}$.
The expression $2n-1$ is odd for every integer $n$, and conversely every odd integer takes the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$
Therefore, there is one solution $n$ for each (not necessarily positive) odd divisor of 20
The positive odd divisors of 20 are 1 and 5, so we solve $2n-1=-5$, $2n-1=-1$, $2n-1=1$, and $2n-1=5$ to find the solutions $n=-2$, $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=3$
These values for $n$ sum to $\boxed{2}$.
We know that both $72$ and $108$ are multiples of $n$, so $108-72=36$ is also a multiple of $n$
That is, $n$ is a divisor of $36$.
Note that $24$ is not divisible by $3^2$, but $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[24,n]=72$ is divisible by $3^2$
This implies that $n$ is a multiple of $3^2$.
Similarly, $27$ is not divisible by $2^2$, but $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$ is divisible by $2^2$
This implies that $n$ is a multiple of $2^2$.
The only divisor of $36$ that is a multiple of $3^2$ and $2^2$ is $36$ itself
Thus, $n=\boxed{36}$.
Dividing 811 by 24 gives a quotient of 33, so the greatest multiple of 24 less than $-811$ is $24\cdot -34=-816$
Thus $-811$ is $-811-(-816)=5$ more than a multiple of $24$
Since $0\leq 5 < 24$, the residue of $-811$ is $\boxed{5}$ (mod 24).
We know that 24,516 is divisible by 1
Since 24,516 is even, it is also divisible by 2
The sum of the digits of 24,516 is $2+4+5+1+6=18$
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, so 24,516 is divisible by 3
For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must be divisible by 4
Because 16 is divisible by 4, so is 24,516
24,516 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in a 5 or 0
It is divisible by 6 because it was divisible by 2 and 3
In order to see if a number is divisible by 7, it is necessary to double the last digit and subtract that value from the original number without the units digit
(In this case, the original number without the units digit is 2451.) If the resulting number is divisible by 7, then so is the original number
When 12 is subtracted from 2451, we get $2451-12=2439$
Since it is still not clear whether this number is divisible by 7, we repeat the process: $243-18=225$ and $22-10=12$
We can now see that 24,516 is not divisible by 7
In order for a number to be divisible by 8, its last three digits must be divisible by 8
Since 516 is not divisible by 8, neither is 24,516
Because the sum of the digits in 24,516 is divisible by 9, 24,516 is divisible by 9
We conclude that 24,516 is divisible by $\boxed{6}$ of the integers from 1 to 9.
Both $m$ and $n$ can be written in the form $11k+5$
For $m$, we have that $11k+5 \ge 100$, so $k \ge \frac{95}{11}$, so since $k$ must be an integer, we have that $k = 9$, so $m = 11(9) + 5 = 104$
For $n$, we have that $11l+5 \ge 1000$, so $l \ge \frac{995}{11}$, so since $l$ must be an integer, we have that $l = 91$, so $n = 11(91) + 5 = 1006$
Therefore, $n-m = 1006 - 104 = \boxed{902}$.
Any factor of $8000=2^6\cdot5^3$ is in the form $2^a\cdot5^b$ for $0\le a\le6$ and $0\le b\le3$
To count the number of perfect square factors, we must count the factors of $2^6\cdot5^3$ that have $a=0$, $2$, $4$ or $6$ and $b=0$ or $2$
This gives $4\cdot2=\boxed{8}$ perfect square factors.
We begin by computing the remainder of some small powers of $7$
As $7^0 = 1, 7^1 = 7,$ and $7^2 = 49$, then $7^3 = 49 \cdot 7 = 343$ leaves a remainder of $43$ after division by $100$, and $7^4$ leaves the remainder that $43 \cdot 7 = 301$ does after division by $100$, namely $1$
The sequence of powers thus repeat modulo $100$ again
In particular, the remainder that the powers of $7$ leave after division by $100$ is periodic with period $4$
Then, $7^{2010} = 7^{4 \cdot 502 + 2}$ leaves the same remainder as $7^2$ does after division by $100$, which is $\boxed{49}$.
Since $15 \mid 15n$, and $15$ is square-free, we must have $15^2 \mid 15n$, so $15 \mid n$
Say $n=15a$
Then $15^2 a = 15n$ is a square, and conversely, if $a$ is a square, then $15^2 a$ is a square
Thus we are counting the number of positive squares $a$ such that $15a \le 1000$ or $a \le \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.6$
The largest such square is $64=8^2$, so the possible values of $a$ are $b^2$ for $b=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$, giving $\boxed{8}$ possible values of $a$ (and hence 8 possible values for $n$).
We are asked to find the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and subtract 5678 from it
The only palindrome in the 5600s is 5665, which is not greater than 5678
The only palindrome in the 5700s is 5775, which is greater than 5678
Therefore, 5775 is the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and $x=5775-5678=\boxed{97}$.
Let $N$ be the desired two-digit number
$N$ is divisible by 2 and by 11, and $(2,11)=1$, so $N$ is divisible by 22
Thus, $N\in\{22, 44, 66, 88\}$
Only 88 is such that the product of its digits is a perfect cube ($8\cdot8=64=4^3$), so $N=\boxed{88}$.
Converting the two expressions to base $10$, it follows that the given positive integer is equal to $9A + B$ and is also equal to $7B + A$
Setting these two expressions equal, we have that $$9A+B = 7B+A \Longrightarrow 8A = 6B \Longrightarrow 4A = 3B.$$ Thus, $B$ is divisible by $4$
Since $B$ is a digit in base $7$, it follows that $B$ is either equal to $0$ or $4$
However, we can discard the case $B = 0$, since its base $7$ representation is no longer a two-digit number
Thus, $B = 4$ and $A = 3$
In base $10$, the number is $9 \cdot 3 + 4 = 7 \cdot 4 + 3 = \boxed{31}.$
If $x$ students sit in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=288=2^5\cdot3^2$
Given that $x\ge15$ and $y\ge10$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^4=16$, $2^3\cdot3=24$, and $2\cdot3^2=18$
Their sum is $16+24+18=\boxed{58}$.
Note that $n+1$ and $n$ will never share any common factors except for $1$, because they are consecutive integers
Therefore, $n/(n+1)$ is already simplified, for all positive integers $n$.
Since $1 \le n \le 100$, it follows that $2 \le n+1 \le 101$
Recall that a simplified fraction has a repeating decimal representation if and only if its denominator is divisible by a prime other than 2 and 5
The numbers between 2 and 101 which are divisible only by 2 and 5 comprise the set $\{2, 4, 5, 8, \allowbreak 10, 16, 20, 25, \allowbreak 32, 40, 50, 64, \allowbreak 80, 100\}$
Therefore, there are $14$ terminating decimals and $100 - 14 = \boxed{86}$ repeating decimals.
We have $1492 = 1500-8 \equiv -8\pmod{500}$ and $1999 = 2000-1\equiv -1\pmod{500}$.
Therefore, $1492\cdot 1999\equiv (-8)\cdot(-1) \equiv 8 \pmod{500}$
The remainder is $\boxed{8}$.
Since $105 = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to find the remainders when $x$ is divided by $3$, $5$, and $7$
As $3+x$ leaves a remainder of $4$ when divided by $27 = 3^3$, it follows that $3+x \equiv 4 \pmod{3}$, and thus that $x\equiv 1 \pmod{3}$
Similarly, \begin{align*}
x &\equiv 9 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \\
x &\equiv 25 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.
\end{align*}As $4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, it follows from the Chinese Remainder Theorem that $x \equiv \boxed{4} \pmod{105}$.
Let the integer be $abcd$
We know that \begin{align*}
a+b+c+d&=14,\\
b+c&=9,\\
a-d&=1.
\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $a+d=5$
Adding this to the third equation, we get $$2a=6\Rightarrow a=3$$ Substituting this into the third equation, we get $d=2$.
Now, the fact that the integer is divisible by $11$ means that $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$
Substituting in the values for $a$ and $d$, this means that $1-b+c$ is divisible by $11$
If this quantity was a positive or negative multiple of $11$, either $b$ or $c$ would need to be greater than $9$, so we must have $1-b+c=0$
With the second equation above, we now have \begin{align*}
c-b&=-1,\\
c+b&=9.
\end{align*} Adding these equations, we get $2c=8$, or $c=4$
Substituting this back in, we get $b=5$
Thus the integer is $\boxed{3542}$.
Notice that when we divide (99)(101) by 9, we get $\frac{99\cdot101}{9}=11\cdot101$
The quotient is an integer and there is no remainder, so (99)(101) is a multiple of 9 and the remainder is $\boxed{0}$.
We notice that $99\cdot101=99\cdot100+99=9999$
We can easily see that 9999 is divisible by 9, as the division results in 1111 with a remainder of 0
Alternatively, a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9
In this case, the sum of the digits in 36, a multiple of 9, so 9999 is a also a multiple of 9
That means the remainder when it is divided by 9 is $\boxed{0}$.
By the Euclidean algorithm, \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,(9n-2,7n+3) &= \text{gcd}\,(9n-2-(7n+3),7n+3) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(2n-5,7n+3) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(2n-5,7n+3-3(2n-5)) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(2n-5,n+18) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(2n-5-2(n+18),n+18) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(-41,n+18).
\end{align*}Since $41$ is prime, it follows that $9n-2$ and $7n+3$ have a common factor greater than 1 only if $n+18$ is divisible by 41
The smallest such positive integer value of $n$ is $41-18=\boxed{23}$
Note that $9n-2 = 205 = 5 \times 41$ and $7n+3 = 164 = 4 \times 41$.
Suppose that $d$ divides $8!$ and that $d>7!$
Taking the reciprocal of both sides of $d>7!$ and multiplying by $8!$, we find $\frac{8!}{d}<\frac{8!}{7!}=8$
There are 7 positive integers less than 8, and $d$ can be chosen so that $\frac{8!}{d}$ takes on any of these values, since $\frac{8!}{d}$ ranges over all the divisors of 8! as $d$ ranges over the divisors of $8!$
Therefore, $\boxed{7}$ divisors of 8! are greater than $7!$.
First, we find the repeating decimal expansion of 5/14: $$ \frac{5}{14} = \frac{5}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{14} = \frac{25}{70} = \frac{25}{7} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = (3.\overline{571428})(0.1) = 0.3\overline{571428}
$$The $1314^{\text{th}}$ digit after the decimal point is the $1313^{\text{th}}$ digit in the 6-digit repeating block 5-7-1-4-2-8
Since $1313 \div 6$ leaves a remainder of 5, our answer is the $5^{\text{th}}$ digit in the 6-digit block, which is $\boxed{2}$.
We want an integer $n$ such that $8 < \sqrt[3]{n} < 8.1$
Cubing each part of the inequality gives $8^3 < n < 8.1^3$, or $512 < n < 531.441$
We know $n$ is a multiple of 18, so we try to find a multiple of 18 in this range (we can do this by letting $n = 18k$, and trying out different integer values of $k$)
We find that $18 \cdot 29 = 522$ is the only multiple of 18 in this range
So $\boxed{522}$ is the answer.
Note that $9^{1995} \equiv 2^{1995} \pmod{7}$
Also, note that $2^3 = 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$
Therefore, \[2^{1995} = 2^{3 \cdot 665} = (2^3)^{665} \equiv \boxed{1} \pmod{7}.\]
Positive integers which are congruent to $2\pmod{5}$ belong to the set $$\{2+5(0), 2+5(1), 2+5(2), ..., \}.$$To find the largest element of this set which is less than or equal to 50, we look for the largest possible integer $n$ such that $$2+5(n-1) \le 50.$$Solving this inequality, we find $n \le 53/5$, so the maximum integer solution is $n=\lfloor 53/5 \rfloor = 10$
Since there are 50 total tiles, the probability that the tile is marked with a number congruent to $2 \pmod{5}$ is $\dfrac{10 \; \text{blue tiles} }{50 \; \text{total tiles}} = \boxed{ \frac{1}{5} } .$
Note firstly that $18 = 2 \cdot 3^2$, so $n$ must be divisible by both $2$ and $3$
Furthermore, $640 = 2^7 \cdot 5$, so $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$ and $5$, since the smallest power of 2 that, when cubed, is no smaller than $2^7$ is $2^3$
Therefore, $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$, $3$, and $5$
Note that $2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 120$ is the smallest possible integer that satisfies all of these conditions, so we have $n = \boxed{120}$.
The first three positive composite numbers are 4, 6, and 8
The units digit of their product, $4\cdot6\cdot8=192$, is $\boxed{2}$.
For every divisor $d$ of $12$, then $12/d$ is also a divisor of $12$
Their product is $d \cdot (12/d) = 12$
It follows that every divisor can be paired with another divisor of $12$ such that their product is $12 = 2^2 \cdot 3$
There are $(2+1)(1+1) = 6$ divisors of $12$: $1,2,3,4,6,12$
Thus, the product of the divisors is given by $12^{6/2} = 12^3 = \boxed{1728}$.
First, observe that the units digit of $22^n$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^n$ for all positive integers $n$
Also, observe that the ones digits of $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \ldots$ are 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, ...
Since $22(11^{11})$ is even but not divisible by 4, it leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4
Therefore, the units digit of $22^{22(11)^{11}}$ is the second digit in the repeating block 2, 4, 8, 6, which is $\boxed{4}$.
If $n$ is divisible by both 2 and 5, then we can write $n$ in the form $10^a \cdot 2^b$ or $10^a \cdot 5^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers
Since $10^a$ simply contributes trailing zeros, we can continue dividing by 10 until $n$ is a power of two or a power of 5
We generate a list of powers of 2
\begin{align*}
2^1 &= 2 \\
2^2 &= 4 \\
2^3 &= 8 \\
2^4 &= 16 \\
2^5 &= 32 \\
2^6 &= 64 \\
2^7 &= 128 \\
2^8 &= 256 \\
2^9 &= 512 \\
2^{10} &= 1024 \\
2^{11} &= 2048 \\
2^{12} &= 4096
\end{align*}Therefore, we can conclude that $n \le 4096$
Looking at the powers of 5, we note that the first five powers of five do not contain the digit 9, and since $5^6 = 15625$, the smallest integer that works is $n = \boxed{4096}$.
We begin by computing the residue of the smallest three digit number modulo 9
We have \[100\equiv1\pmod9.\] Therefore 100 is not 9-heavy
Counting up from 100 we notice that the first 9-heavy three-digit number is $\boxed{105}$, since it has a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.
The prime factors of $\gcd(a,b)$ are precisely the prime factors which are common to $a$ and $b$ (i.e., the primes that divide both)
The prime factors of $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ are the primes which divide at least one of $a$ and $b$.
Thus, there are $7$ primes which divide both $a$ and $b$, and $28-7=21$ more primes which divide exactly one of $a$ and $b$
Since $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, we know that fewer than half of these $21$ primes divide $a$; at most, $10$ of these primes divide $a$
So, $a$ has at most $7+10=\boxed{17}$ distinct prime factors.
Let us first determine the number of cubes that are less than $2010$
We have $10^3 = 1000$, $11^3 = 1331$, and $12^3 = 1728$, but $13^3 = 2197$
So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$
As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$
There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1
Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$
There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010
Therefore, there are $12+3+1 = \boxed{16}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$.
Let $a$ be the least number of cookies Mohan could have
From the given information, we know that \begin{align*}
a&\equiv 3\pmod 4\\
a&\equiv 2\pmod 5\\
a&\equiv 4\pmod 7
\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $m$ such that $a=3+4m$
Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \[3+4m\equiv 2\pmod 5\implies m\equiv 1\pmod 5.\] So there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $m=1+5n$
Substituting $a=3+4m$ into $(3)$ yields \[3+4m\equiv 4\pmod 7\implies m\equiv 2\pmod 7.\] Substituting $m=1+5n$ into this gives \[1+5n\equiv 2\pmod 7\implies n\equiv 3\pmod 7.\] The least $n$ such that $n\equiv 3\pmod 7$ is $n=3$
Since \[a=3+4m=3+4(1+5n)=7+20n,\]we have\[n\ge 3\implies a=7+20n\ge 67.\] Since $67$ satisfies the three congruences, $a=\boxed{67}$.
In the rightmost column there is no carrying, so our base must be greater than 11
In the next column, we see that $9_{a}+6_{a}=13_{a}$
This tells us that $a$ goes into 15 once, leaving a remainder of 3
Therefore, $a=\boxed{12}$.
Noticing that $190\equiv0\pmod{19}$ and $-200+190=-10$, we can say that  \[-200\equiv n\pmod{19}\]if and only if  \[-10\equiv n\pmod{19}.\]This is not in the range $0\leq n<19$, but adding 19 again gives \[9\equiv n\pmod{19}.\]The answer is $n=\boxed{9}$.
If the two people received one fewer coin, then the number of gold coins you would have would be a multiple of 11
However, there are two extra coins there, so the number of gold coins you have can be written in the form $11k+2$
We have that $11k+2 < 100$, so $k < \frac{98}{11}$
Since $k$ is the number of gold coins each person is receiving, $k$ must be an integer, so we have that $k = 8$
Therefore, the largest number of gold coins you could have is $11(8) + 2 = \boxed{90}$.
To find the least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, we ignore 1 and prime factorize the rest to obtain $2, 3, 2^2, 5, 2\cdot 3, 7, 2^3$, and $3^2$
Taking the maximum exponent for each prime, we find that the least common multiple is $2^3\cdot 3^2\cdot 5\cdot 7 = \boxed{2520}$.
Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14
Since $15\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7
So the residue of the sum is  $$
182\cdot 12 - 15\cdot 7 + 3 \equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \equiv -4 \equiv \boxed{10} \pmod{14}.
We can look at the terms of the Lucas sequence modulo 8
\begin{align*}
L_1 &\equiv 1\pmod{8}, \\
L_2 &\equiv 3\pmod{8}, \\
L_3 &\equiv 4\pmod{8}, \\
L_4 &\equiv 7\pmod{8}, \\
L_5 &\equiv 3\pmod{8}, \\
L_6 &\equiv 2\pmod{8}, \\
L_7 &\equiv 5\pmod{8}, \\
L_8 &\equiv 7\pmod{8}, \\
L_9 &\equiv 4\pmod{8}, \\
L_{10} &\equiv 3\pmod{8}, \\
L_{11} &\equiv 7\pmod{8}, \\
L_{12} &\equiv 2\pmod{8}, \\
L_{13} &\equiv 1\pmod{8}, \\
L_{14} &\equiv 3\pmod{8}, \\
L_{15} &\equiv 4\pmod{8}, \\
L_{16} &\equiv 7\pmod{8}.
\end{align*}Since $L_{13}=1$ and $L_{14}=3$, the sequence begins repeating at the 13th term, so it repeats every 12 terms
Since the remainder is 4 when we divide 100 by 12, we know $L_{100}\equiv L_4\pmod 8$
Therefore the remainder when $L_{100}$ is divided by 8 is $\boxed{7}$.
We use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find that the arithmetic mean of the positive two-digit multiples of 7 is $\frac{14+21+...+98}{13}=\frac{1}{13}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot13\cdot(14+98)=\boxed{56}$.
We start with 1800, a multiple of 900, and add 200 to get 2000
So 2000 has a remainder of 200 when divided by 900
The next year with a remainder of 200 when divided by 900 is $2000+900=2900$
The year after that is $2900+900=3800$
Adding another 900 would result in a year greater than 4096.
Now we add 600 to 1800 and get 2400, which has a remainder of 600 when divided by 900
The next year with a remainder of 600 is $2400+900=3300$
Adding another 900 would result in a year greater than 4096.
So the years with remainders of 200 or 600 are 2000, 2900, 3800, 2400, and 3300
All of them end in double zeroes, so they are all leap years
We have a total of $\boxed{5}$ leap years.
We can create inequalities
A leap year is equal to either $900a+200$ or $900b+600$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers
We solve for how many possible values of $a$ and $b$ we have
$$1996<900a+200<4096\qquad\Rightarrow 1796<900a<3896$$ So the value of $a$ can be 2, 3, or 4, giving us 3 different leap years
$$1996<900a+600<4096\qquad\Rightarrow 1396<900b<3496$$ So the value of $b$ can be 2 or 3, giving us 2 different leap years
In total we have $\boxed{5}$ leap years.
We will end up with leap years when we add 200 or 600 to a multiple of 900
With 1800, we can add 200 or 600 to get two leap years
With 2700, we can add 200 or 600 to get two leap years
With 3600, we only get one leap year since $3600+600=4200$ is after 4096
We get a total of $\boxed{5}$ leap years.
We will search for palindromic primes in the 100s
Since the hundreds digit is 1, the ones digit must also be 1
We can only vary the tens digit
Setting the tens digit equal to 1, we look at the number 111
This number is not prime (divisible by 3)
Setting the tens digit equal to 2, we look at the number 121
This number is not prime (divisible by 11)
Setting the tens digit equal to 3, we look at the number 131
This number is prime, so the second-smallest palindromic prime is $\boxed{131}$.
If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total
This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row
This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30
We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30
As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33
33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\boxed{33}$ students.
We can split $0.5\overline{10}$ into $0.5+0.\overline{01}$.
First we convert $0.\overline{01}$ to a fraction by setting $0.\overline{01}=x$
Multiplying both sides by 100, we get $100x =1.\overline{01}$
We subtract those two equations to get: \begin{align*}
100 \cdot x - x &= 1.\overline{01}-0.\overline{01} \quad \implies \\
99 \cdot x &=1 \quad \implies \\
x&= \frac{1}{99}.
\end{align*}We add 1/99 to $0.5=1/2$ to get $0.5\overline{01}=\frac12+\frac{1}{99}=\boxed{\frac{101}{198}}$.
We must first find how many positive integers less than 200 are multiples of both 18 and 24
$18=2\cdot3^2$ and $24=2^3\cdot3$, so the LCM of 18 and 24 is $2^3\cdot3^2=72$
Therefore, an integer is a multiple of both 18 and 24 if and only if it is a multiple of 72.
Dividing 200 by 72 gives quotient 2 (and remainder 56), so there are 2 multiples of 72 less than 200.
Dividing 200 by 18 gives quotient 11 (and remainder 2), so there are 11 multiples of 18 less than 200.
Dividing 200 by 24 gives quotient 8 (and remainder 8), so there are 8 multiples of 24 less than 200.
Therefore, Billy and Bobbi together can pick $11\cdot8=88$ different two-number combinations, and 2 of these involve them choosing the same number (the two multiples of 72 are the possible duplicate numbers)
Thus, the probability that they selected the same number is $2/88=\boxed{\frac{1}{44}}$.
Let's find the prime factorization of $150,280$:
\begin{align*}
150{,}280 &= 2^3\cdot18{,}785 \\
&= 2^3\cdot5\cdot3757 \\
&= 2^3\cdot5\cdot13\cdot289 \\
&= 2^3\cdot5\cdot13\cdot17^2.
\end{align*}Thus the sum of the different prime factors of 150,280 is $2+5+13+17=\boxed{37}$.
The circumference of the larger circle, $C_1$, is $2\cdot5\pi=10\pi$
The circumference of the smaller circle, $C_2$, is $2\cdot2\pi=4\pi$
The bug on $C_1$ crawls the circumference in $\frac{10\pi}{3\pi}=\frac{10}{3}$ minutes, while the bug on $C_2$ crawls the circumference in $\frac{4\pi}{2.5\pi}=\frac{8}{5}$ minutes
The two bugs will meet at point P in some $t$ minutes, when $t\div\frac{10}{3}=\frac{3t}{10}$ and $t\div\frac{8}{5}=\frac{5t}{8}$ are both integers
We have $\text{GCD}(3,10)=\text{GCD}(5,8)=1$, so we have to find the LCM of $10=2\cdot5$ and $8=2^3$
The LCM is $2^3\cdot5=40$, so the bugs will next meet in $t=\boxed{40}$ minutes.
Note that $656_7=6\cdot7^2+5\cdot7^1+6\cdot7^0=335_{10}$
Therefore, $a=3$, $b=5$, and $\frac{a\cdot b}{15}=\frac{3\cdot5}{15}=\boxed{1}$.
We start by taking the first step in the Euclidean algorithm: subtract the initial two terms
Notice that
\begin{align*}a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)(n! + n) \\ &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)! - n(n+1) \\ &= -n^2 + 1 = -(n-1)(n+1).
\end{align*}It follows that by the Euclidean Algorithm, \begin{align*}\text{gcd}\,(a_n, a_{n+1}) &= \text{gcd}\,(a_n, a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n)\\ &= \text{gcd}\,(a_n, (n-1)(n+1)),\end{align*}since the minus sign is irrelevant for calculating the gcd.
We know that $n-1$ divides $n!$, so that $n-1$ is relatively prime to $a_n = n! + n$:
$$\text{gcd}\,(n-1,n!+n) = \text{gcd}\,(n-1,n) = 1.$$Thus, we can ignore the factor of $n-1$ completely, and say that
$$\text{gcd}\,(a_n,a_{n+1}) = \text{gcd}\,(n! + n, n+1).$$Now, we have several cases, depending on whether $n+1$ is prime or composite
We also have a few edge cases to consider
The basic idea is that when $n+1$ is composite and greater than $4$, $n+1$ is a factor of $n!$, whereas when $n+1$ is prime, we can apply Wilson's Theorem.
$\textit{Case 0:}$ For $n = 0$, we find that $a_0 = 1, a_1 = 2$, with greatest common divisor $1$.
$\textit{Case composite:}$
$\qquad \textit{Subcase 1:}$ If $n+1$ is composite and can be written as the product of two distinct integers greater than $1$ (say $n+1 = a \times b$, $a > b > 1$), then $n+1$ divides
$$n! = 1 \times \cdots \times b \times \cdots \times a \times \cdots \times n.$$By the same argument as before, since $n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, then $n! + n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, yielding a greatest common divisor of $1$.
$\qquad \textit{Subcase 2:}$ If $n+1 = p^2$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n = (p^2 - 1)! + p^2-1$
If $2p < p^2 - 1$, then $p$ and $2p$ are both factors that appear in the expansion of $n!$, so $n+1$ divides $n!$ and the previous argument applies
For $p = 2$, we can quickly check that $3! + 3 = 9$ is relatively prime with $4$.
$\textit{Case prime:}$ If $n + 1 = p$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n \equiv (p-1)! + (p-1) \equiv -2 \pmod{p}$ by Wilson's Theorem
Thus, $n! + n$ is relatively prime with $n+1$ unless $n = 1$, for which we obtain $a_1 = 2, a_2 = 4$, with greatest common divisor 2.
So, the largest the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n$ can be is $\boxed{2}$, which is achieved when we take $n=1$.
The prime factorization of a positive integer factor of 2160 is of the form $2^a\cdot3^b\cdot 5^c$ where $0\leq a\leq 4$, $0\leq b\leq 3$, and $0\leq c\leq 1$
A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even
Therefore, we are free to choose $a$ from the set $\{0,2,4\}$ and $b$ from the set $\{0,2\}$
In total, we have $3\times 2=\boxed{6}$ choices for the exponents in the prime factorization of a perfect square factor of 2160.
We begin by listing all the factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36
We can now start listing products of factors from least to greatest and find the first item in the second list that is not in the first; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8..
8 is not a factor of 36, but is the product of 2 and 4
We can check that there are no smaller products of factors that do not divide 36: 5 and 7 are the only possibilities, and obviously neither of them can be products of factors of 36
$\boxed{8}$ is thus the smallest such product.
There are $13$ cards in the pattern from $A$ to $K$
When you divide $42$ by $13$, you get $3$ with a remainder of $3$
Therefore, the $42^\text{nd}$ card is a $\boxed{3}$.
Let $N = 109876543210$
Notice that $180 = 4 \times 9 \times 5$, so by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to evaluate the remainders when $N$ is divided by each of $4$, $9$, and $5$
We can apply the divisibility rules to find each of these
Since the last two digits of $N$ are $10$, it follows that $N \equiv 10 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$
We know that $N$ is divisible by $5$, so $N \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$
Finally, since $N$ leaves the same residue modulo $9$ as the sum of its digits, then $$N \equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 9 + 1 \equiv 1+ \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} \equiv 46 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}.$$By the Chinese Remainder Theorem and inspection, it follows that $N \equiv 10 \pmod{4 \cdot 9}$, and since $10$ is also divisible by $5$, then $N \equiv \boxed{10} \pmod{180}$.
A number is congruent to the sum of its digits $\pmod 9$
Thus, \begin{align*}
1+22+333&+4444+55555+666666+7777777+88888888\\ &\equiv 1+4+9+16+25+36+49+64 \\
&\equiv 1+4+0+7+7+0+4+1 \\
&= 24 \\
&\equiv \boxed{6}\pmod 9.
\end{align*}
Notice that $121_5 \times 11_5 = 121_5 \times (10_5 + 1_5) = 1210_5 + 121_5 = \boxed{1331}_5$.
$7.5<\frac{N}{3}<8\Rightarrow 22.5< N< 24$
Since $N$ is a whole number, $N=\boxed{23}$.
The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9
Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\times8=72$
The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\boxed{150}$ members.
By the uniqueness of the binary representation of positive integers, there is only one way to represent 400 as a sum of distinct powers of $2$
To find this representation, we convert 400 to binary form
The largest power of $2$ less than 400 is $2^8=256$
The difference between 400 and 256 is 144
The largest power of 2 less than 144 is $2^7=128$
The difference between 144 and 128 is 16
Since $16=2^4$, we have found that $400=2^8+2^7+2^4$
The sum of the exponents of 2 in this representation is $\boxed{19}$.
Let's investigate the ones digits of successive powers of each of the integers from 0 through 9
At each step, we can throw away any digits other than the ones digits
Take 8 as an example: $8^1$ ends in 8, $8\times 8$ ends in 4, $8\times 4$ ends in $2$, $8\times 2$ ends in 6, $8\times 6$ ends in 8, and the pattern repeats from there
Therefore, the ones digits of $8^1, 8^2, 8^3, \ldots$ are $8, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 2, 6, \ldots$
The results for all the digits are shown below.
\begin{array}{c|c}
n & \text{ones digit of } n, n^2, n^3, \ldots \\ \hline
0 & 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \ldots \\
1 & 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, \ldots \\
2 & 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, \ldots \\
3 & 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, \ldots \\
4 & 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, \ldots \\
5 & 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, \ldots \\
6 & 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, \ldots \\
7 & 7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, \ldots \\
8 & 8, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, \ldots \\
9 & 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 1, \ldots \\
\end{array}
\]The lengths of the repeating blocks for these patterns are 1, 2, and 4
Therefore, for any digit $d$ and any exponent $a$ which is one more than a multiple of 4, the ones digit of $d^a$ is $d$
Also, if $n$ is a positive integer, then the ones digit of $n^a$ only depends on the ones digit of $n$
Therefore, for any positive integer $n$ and any exponent $a$ which is one more than a multiple of 4, the ones digit of $n^a$ is the ones digit of $n$
Let us write ``$\equiv$'' to mean ``has the same ones digit as.''  Since $2009$ is one more than a multiple of 4, we find \begin{align*}
1^{2009}+2^{2009}+\cdots+2009^{2009} &\equiv 1 + 2 + 3 +\cdots 2009 \\
&=\frac{2009(2010)}{2} \\
&= 2009(1005) \\
&\equiv 9\cdot 5 \\
&\equiv \boxed{5}.
\end{align*}
Adding the first digits, we get $8$, hence $2$ after carrying
Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, with carrying
Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, again with carrying
Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $2$, with carrying
Finally, adding $1$ to one, we get $2$
Thus our final answer is $\boxed{22112_6}$.
Note that $n^2-n=n(n-1)$ is divisible by $1$, $n-1$, and $n$
Since we want $n^2-n$ to be divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\le k\le n$, we must have $n-1>2$ so $n>3$
If $n=4$, $n$ is divisible by 2, so $n^2-n$ is divisible by all integer values of $k$ when $1\le k\le n$
Therefore, the least $n$ is $n=\boxed{5}$.
Keep up with which days are Thursdays by repeatedly adding 7: November 23, November 30, December 7, December 14, and December 21
Since December 23 is two days after December 21, it falls on a $\boxed{\text{Saturday}}$.
We will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem as follows: We will compute the remainders when $a_{44}$ is divided by $5$ and $9$
The remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45 will be the residue (mod 45) which leaves the same remainders when divided by 5 and 9 as $a_{44}$ does
Since $a_{44}$ ends in $4$, it gives a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$.
For the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 9, note that  \begin{align*}
a_{44}&=44+43\cdot 10^2 + 42 \cdot 10^4+41\cdot 10^6+\cdots+10\cdot10^{68}\\
&\qquad+9\cdot 10^{70}+8\cdot 10^{71}+\cdots + 1\cdot 10^{78} \\ &\equiv 44+43+42+\cdots+1\pmod{9},
\end{align*}since $10^n\equiv 1^n\equiv 1\pmod{9}$ for all nonnegative integers $n$
In words, this calculation shows that we can sum groups of digits in any way we choose to check for divisibility by 9
For example, 1233 is divisible by 9 since $12+33=45$ is divisible by 9
This is a generalization of the rule that a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9
Getting back to the problem at hand, we sum $44+43+\cdots+1$ using the formula $1+2+\cdots+n=n(n+1)/2$ to find that $a_{44}$ is divisible by 9.
We are looking for a multiple of $9$ that gives a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$
Nine satisfies this condition, so the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45 is $\boxed{9}$.
The first three prime numbers are $2$, $3$, and $5$, and their reciprocals are $1/2$, $1/3$, and $1/5$ respectively
To find the mean of these three numbers, we must first find their sum and then divide that sum by $3$
To find the sum of $1/2$, $1/3$, and $1/5$, we first place each fraction over their least common denominator of $30$
Thus, we have that $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{15}{30} + \frac{10}{30} + \frac{6}{30} = \frac{31}{30}.$$
Dividing $\frac{31}{30}$ by $3$, we get that the mean of these three numbers is $\frac{31}{30 \cdot 3} = \boxed{\frac{31}{90}}$.
The most efficient means of searching for this trio of integers is to begin with the multiples of $7^2$
The first such number is 49, which almost works, since 50 is divisible by $5^2$ and 48 is divisible by $2^2$
But none of the nearby numbers is divisible by $3^2$, so we move on to the next multiple of $7^2$, which is 98
To our delight we discover that $3^2$ divides 99, while $2^2$ and $5^2$ divide 100
Hence we should take $N=\boxed{98}$.
Note firstly that $f(i)$ must be an integer, so this means that $i$ must be a perfect square in order for $\sqrt{i}$ to be an integer
Out of the perfect squares, we claim that $i$ must be the square of some prime $p$
For if $\sqrt{i}$ is composite, then it can be written as the product of two integers $a$ and $b$ and we find $f(i) \ge 1 + \sqrt{i} + i + a + b > 1 + \sqrt{i} + i$
Moreover, if $\sqrt{i}$ is prime, then the only factors of $i$ are 1, $\sqrt{i}$, and $i$, so $f(i) = 1 + \sqrt{i} + i$ as desired
It follows that we only need to calculate the number of primes less than $\sqrt{2010}$
Since $\sqrt{2010} < 45$, the desired set of primes is $\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43\}$
The set has $\boxed{14}$ elements.
Every multiple of 25 ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75
Since we want the product of the digits to be a positive multiple of 25, the final two digits must be either 25 or 75.
A nonzero product of digits is a multiple of 25 exactly when two or more of the digits is are equal to 5
If a number ends in 75 and the product of its digits is a multiple of 25, then replacing 75 by 25 in that number will also give a smaller number whose product of digits is a multiple of 25
Therefore we are looking for a number whose final two digits are 25 and for which 5 is one of the other digits.
Since 525 is the smallest such number, the answer must be $\boxed{525}$.
We notice that both $A$ and $B$ are factors of 999,999
Specifically \[9A=999999\]and \[7B=999999.\]Taken modulo 1,000,000 these equations read \begin{align*}
9A&\equiv-1\pmod{1{,}000{,}000}\\
7B&\equiv-1\pmod{1{,}000{,}000}\\
\end{align*}We are set if we multiply these equations: \[(9A)(7B)\equiv1\pmod{1{,}000{,}000}\]so $N=9\cdot7=\boxed{63}$ is the multiplicative inverse to $AB$ modulo 1,000,000.
The largest power of 6 less than 515 is $6^3=216$, and the largest multiple of 216 less than 515 is $2\cdot216=432$
That means there is a 2 in the $6^3$ place
We have $515-432=83$ left
The largest multiple of a power of 6 that is less than 83 is $2\cdot6^2=72$
There is a 2 in the $6^2$ place
Now we're left with $83-72=11$, which can be represented as $1\cdot6^1+5\cdot6^0$
So, we get $515=2\cdot6^3+2\cdot6^2+1\cdot6^1+5\cdot6^0=\boxed{2215_6}$.
The prime numbers are $23$ and $29$
Since $29-23=6$, the mean is $\frac62=3$ numbers away from $23$ and from $29$
The mean is $\boxed{26}$
We can also find the mean of $23$ and $29$ with $\frac{29+23}{2}=\frac{52}{2}=26$ or just by noticing that the number in the middle of $23$ and $29$ is $26$.
We are counting the number of ways 36 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers such that one of the numbers is not 1
Factoring 36, we find that $36=2^2\cdot3^2$
The possible values for the number of rows is 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 (notice that we cannot have 1 row)
Each value corresponds to a unique arrangement of the chairs
Thus, there are $\boxed{7}$ possible arrays.
To find the tens digit of $17^{1993}$, we can look at the first few power of 17 modulo 100: \begin{align*}
17^0 &\equiv 1, \\
17^1 &\equiv 17, \\
17^2 &\equiv 17 \cdot 17 \equiv 289 \equiv 89, \\
17^3 &\equiv 17 \cdot 89 \equiv 1513 \equiv 13, \\
17^4 &\equiv 17 \cdot 13 \equiv 221 \equiv 21 \pmod{100}.
\end{align*}
We know that if we find a power of 17 whose last two digits are 01, then the last two digits in the power of 17 become periodic at that point
We don't have that in $17^4$, but the units digit in $17^4$ is 1
We have matched the units digit, so let's use powers of $17^4$: \begin{align*}
17^4 &\equiv 21, \\
17^8 &\equiv 21 \cdot 21 \equiv 441 \equiv 41, \\
17^{12} &\equiv 21 \cdot 41 \equiv 861 \equiv 61, \\
17^{16} &\equiv 21 \cdot 61 \equiv 1281 \equiv 81, \\
17^{20} &\equiv 21 \cdot 81 \equiv 1701 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}.
\end{align*} We found a power of 17 whose last two digits are 01, so the last two digits are periodic, with period 20.
Since $1993 \equiv 13 \pmod{20}$, \[17^{1993} \equiv 17^{13} \pmod{100}.\] Then \begin{align*}
17^{13} &\equiv 17^{12} \cdot 17 \\
&\equiv 61 \cdot 17 \\
&\equiv 1037 \\
&\equiv 37 \pmod{100}.
\end{align*} Therefore, the tens digit of $17^{1993}$ is $\boxed{3}$.
For $D\,767\,E89$ to be divisible by $9,$ we must have $$D+7+6+7+E+8+9 = 37+D+E$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $D$ and $E$ are each a single digit, we know each is between $0$ and $9.$ Therefore, $D+E$ is between $0$ and $18.$ Therefore, $37+D+E$ is between $37$ and $55.$ The numbers between $37$ and $55$ that are divisible by $9$ are $45$ and $54.$
If $37+D+E=45,$ then $D+E=8.$
If $37+D+E=54,$ then $D+E=17.$
Therefore, the possible values of $D+E$ are $8$ and $17.$ Our answer is then $8+17=\boxed{25}.$
The multiples of 2 from 1 to 100 are $2, 4, 6,\ldots, 100$
There are 50 such numbers.
The multiples of 3 from 1 to 100 are $3, 6, 9,\ldots, 99$
There are 33 such numbers.
These lists count all of the multiples of 6 twice
The multiples of 6 are $6, 12,\ldots,96$, and there are 16 such multiples of 6
Therefore there are $50+33-16=67$ multiples of 2 or 3 from 1 to 100.
All of the 25 multiples of 4 from 1 to 100 are on this list
Therefore there are $67-25=\boxed{42}$ numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4.
By the arithmetic series formula, $T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, so $4T_n = 2n(n+1) = 2n^2 + 2n$
By the Euclidean algorithm, \begin{align*}\text{gcd}\,(2n^2 + 2n, n-1) &= \text{gcd}\,(2n^2 + 2n - (n-1) \times 2n, n-1) \\ &= \text{gcd}\,(4n, n - 1) \\ &= \text{gcd}\,(4n - 4(n-1) , n-1) \\ &= \text{gcd}\,(4, n -1) \le \boxed{4}.\end{align*} For example, this is true for $n = 5$.
Since $3n$ is a perfect square, that means that $n$ has to be a multiple of $3$
Since $2n$ is a perfect cube, then $n$ has to be divisible by $2^2=4$
Since $n$ is a multiple of $3$, then $n$ also has to be divisible by $3^3=27$
Therefore, the smallest value for $n$ is $4 \cdot 27 =\boxed{108}$.
Let $x = 0.\overline{42}$
Multiplying both sides by 100, we get $100x = 42.\overline{42}$
Subtracting these two equations gives $99x = 42$, so $x = \frac{42}{99} = \frac{14}{33}$
Thus $a+b = 14+33 = \boxed{47}$.
Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5
Prime factorizing 475 as $5^2\cdot 19$, we see that $\frac{n}{475}$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 19
There are 24 multiples of 19 from 1 to 474, so there are $\boxed{24}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\frac{n}{475}$ a terminating decimal.
We can look at the terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 8
\begin{align*}
F_1 &\equiv 1\pmod{8}, \\
F_2 &\equiv 1\pmod{8}, \\
F_3 &\equiv 2\pmod{8}, \\
F_4 &\equiv 3\pmod{8}, \\
F_5 &\equiv 5\pmod{8}, \\
F_6 &\equiv 0\pmod{8}, \\
F_7 &\equiv 5\pmod{8}, \\
F_8 &\equiv 5\pmod{8}, \\
F_9 &\equiv 2\pmod{8}, \\
F_{10} &\equiv 7\pmod{8}, \\
F_{11} &\equiv 1\pmod{8}, \\
F_{12} &\equiv 0\pmod{8}, \\
F_{13} &\equiv 1\pmod{8}, \\
F_{14} &\equiv 1\pmod{8}, \\
F_{15} &\equiv 2\pmod{8}, \\
F_{16} &\equiv 3\pmod{8}.
\end{align*}Since $F_{13}$ and $F_{14}$ are both 1, the sequence begins repeating at the 13th term, so it repeats every 12 terms
Since the remainder is 4 when we divide 100 by 12, we know $F_{100}\equiv F_4\pmod 8$
Therefore the remainder when $F_{100}$ is divided by 8 is $\boxed{3}$.
The prime factorization of $432 = 2^4 \cdot 3^3$
It follows that the sum of the divisors is equal to $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3)$, as each factor of $432$ is represented when the product is expanded
We have to subtract $432$ so that we only count the proper divisors, so the answer is \begin{align*}
(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16)(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) - 432 &= (31)(40) - 432\\
&= 1240 - 432\\
&= \boxed{808}.\\
\end{align*}
Since 38 and 57 are both divisible by 19, so is $38000+570$
Therefore we can say  \[38574=19(2030)+4.\]This tells us that  \[38574\equiv 4\pmod{19}\]The answer is $n=\boxed{4}$.
The last three digits are the same as the remainder when divided by $1000$.
$3^{400}\equiv 1\pmod{1000}\implies 3^{12000}=(3^{400})^{30}\equiv 1^{30}=1\pmod{1000}$.
Thus, the last three digits are $\boxed{001}$.
Any odd multiple of 5 will end in a units digit of 5 (even multiples will end in a units digit of 0)
Since all the integers we are multiplying are odd and some of them have a factor of 5, the product will be an odd multiple of 5 with a units digit of $\boxed{5}$.
Reducing each factor modulo 19 first, we see that $2001 \cdot 2002 \cdot 2003 \cdot 2004 \cdot 2005 \equiv 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 10 \equiv 30240 \equiv \boxed{11} \pmod{19}$.
If $10x+y$ is prime, then $y$ cannot be 2 or 5
So if $x$ and $y$ are prime digits, then $y$ must be 3 or 7 and $x$ must be one of the other three prime digits
Checking the six resulting cases, we find that the prime numbers of the form $10x+y$ where $x$ and $y$ are both prime digits are 23, 53, 73, and 37
The values of $xy(10x+y)$ for these four numbers are 138, 795, 1533, and 777
The largest of these values which is less than 1000 is $\boxed{795}$.
For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible
To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$
We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number
$0+1+2+3+4=10$
However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$
Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.
Now, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number
We want the larger places to have larger numbers
Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\boxed{643210}$.
We can use the Euclidean Algorithm
\begin{align*}
&\text{gcd}\,(2a^2+29a+65,a+13)\\
&\qquad=\text{gcd}\,(2a^2+29a+65-(a+13)(2a+3),a+13)\\
&\qquad=\text{gcd}\,(2a^2+29a+65-(2a^2+29a+39),a+13)\\
&\qquad=\text{gcd}\,(26,a+13).
\end{align*}Since $a$ is an odd multiple of $1183$, which is an odd multiple of $13$, $a+13$ must be an even multiple of $13$
This means that $26$ is a divisor  of $a+13$, so the greatest common divisor is $\boxed{26}$.
First notice that $(11-n)^2=11^2-2\cdot 11+n^2\equiv n^2\pmod{11}$, and since we're asked to find distinct results, we only need to compute the squares of $n=1,2,3,4,5$
Respectively, $n^2\equiv 1,4,9,5,3\pmod{11}$
Thus, $1+4+9+5+3=22=11\cdot\boxed{2}$.
Note that $6!=6\cdot5!$
Therefore, the greatest common factor must be $5!=\boxed{120}$.
The expression $\frac{n+6}{n}$ can be simplified as $\frac{n}{n}+\frac{6}{n}$, or $1+\frac{6}{n}$
So in order for this expression to have an integral value, 6 must be divisible by $n$
Therefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ is just the sum of all the divisors of $6$
Since the prime factorization of 6 is $2\cdot3$, we know that 6 is only divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, and the final answer is $1+2+3+6=\boxed{12}$.
The first 10 terms of any arithmetic sequence can be represented as $x$, $x+c$, $x+2c$, $\ldots x+9c$, where $x$ is the first term and $c$ is the constant difference between each consecutive term
So, the sum of all of these terms will include $10x$ and $(1+2+\ldots+9)c$, which equals $45c$
As a result, the sum of all the terms is $10x+45c$ and the greatest number we can factor out is $\boxed{5}$, where we end up with $5(2x+9c)$.
For $n\ge5$, $n!$ includes the product $2\times5=10$, which means the units digit of $n!$ is 0 (since 0 multiplied by any number is 0)
The units digits of $1!+ 2!+3!+4!$ is the units digit of $1+2+6+4=13$, which is 3
The units digit of the sum $1+2+\ldots+9=\frac{9(1+9)}{2}=45$ is 5
Therefore, the units digit of $(1!+1)+(2!+2)+\ldots+(9!+9)= (1!+2!+\ldots+9!)+(1+2+\ldots+9)$ is $3+5=\boxed{8}.$
We know that at least one of our three consecutive positive integers must be a multiple of $2$ since every other integer in a list of consecutive integers is divisible by $2$
Similarly, one of our three consecutive integers must also be divisible by $3$
Thus, the product of our three integers must be divisible by $2 \cdot 3 = 6$
By choosing the example where our three consecutive integers are $1$, $2$, and $3$ and their product is $6$, we see that $\boxed{6}$ is indeed the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers.
By definition of a base, it follows that $\overline{ABC}_6 = 6^2 \cdot A + 6 \cdot B + C$
Noting that every digit appears in every possible slot once, it follows that $\overline{ABC}_6 + \overline{BCA}_6+ \overline{CAB}_6 = (6^2 + 6 + 1)(A + B + C).$ The value is equal to the sum, $\overline{AAA0}_6 = 6^3 \cdot A + 6^2 \cdot A + 6 \cdot A = (6^2 + 6 + 1) \cdot (6 \cdot A)$
Setting them equal, $$(6^2 + 6 + 1)(A + B + C) = (6^2 + 6 + 1) \cdot (6 \cdot A) \Longrightarrow B+C = 5 \cdot A.$$Since $B,C < 6$, then $B+C < 2 \cdot 6$, so $A = 1,2$
However, there do not exist distinct base $6$ digits such that $B + C = 2 \cdot 5$, so it follows that $A = 1_6$, and $B+C = \boxed{5}_6$.
We prime factorize the given number as $2^8\cdot 3^2\cdot 5^4$
A factor of this number takes the form $2^a3^b5^c$ for integers $a$ between 0 and 8, $b$ between 0 and 2, and $c$ between 0 and 4
There are $9$ ways to choose $a$, 3 ways to choose $b$, and 5 ways to choose $c$
In total, there are $9\cdot3\cdot5 = \boxed{135}$ factors.
Since $2_7 + 2_7 = 4_7$, the units digit is $\boxed{4}$.
The first ten positive composite integers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18
The desired quotient is $\frac{4\cdot6\cdot8\cdot9\cdot10}{12\cdot14\cdot15\cdot16\cdot18}$
After cancellation, we get $\frac{1}{14\cdot3}=\boxed{\frac{1}{42}}$.
$$ 3240 = 2^3 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 5^1 $$A positive divisor of 3240 is a multiple of 3 when it has a prime factorization in the form $2^a \cdot 3^b \cdot 5^c$ where $0 \le a \le 3$, $1 \le b \le 4$, and $0 \le c \le 1$
There are $4 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 = \boxed{32}$ choices for $a$, $b$, and $c$, giving the number of positive divisors of 3240 that are multiples of 3.
In base 16, $A = 10$, $B = 11$, $C = 12$, $D = 13$, $E = 14$, and $F = 15$
So $A03 = 10\cdot16^2 + 0\cdot16 + 3 = \boxed{2563}.$
Since $-3736 \equiv 2 \pmod{6}$, the integer $n$ we seek is $n = \boxed{2}$.
Consider the differences between consecutive prime numbers and look for the first difference of 6 or greater
The first several prime numbers are \[
2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31, 37,\ldots,
\] and the differences between consecutive terms of this sequence are  \[
1,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,6,2,\ldots.
\] The first appearance of a difference of 6 or greater occurs between 23 and $\boxed{29}$.
We convert $n$ to base $10$
The base $7$ expression implies that $n = 49A + 7B + C$, and the base $11$ expression implies that $n = 121C + 11B + A$
Setting the two expressions equal to each other yields that $$n = 49A + 7B + C = 121C + 11B + A \Longrightarrow 48A - 4B - 120C = 0.$$Isolating $B$, we get $$B = \frac{48A - 120C}{4} = 12A - 30C = 6(2A - 5C).$$It follows that $B$ is divisible by $6$, and since $B$ is a base $7$ digit, then $B$ is either $0$ or $6$
If $B$ is equal to $0$, then $2A - 5C = 0 \Longrightarrow 2A = 5C$, so $A$ must be divisible by $5$ and hence must be either $0$ or $5$
Since $n$ is a three-digit number in base $7$, then $A \neq 0$, so $A = 5$ and $C = 2$
Thus, $n = 502_7 = 5 \cdot 7^2 + 2 = 247$.
If $B$ is equal to $6$, then $2A - 5C = 1$, so $2A - 1 = 5C$ and $2A - 1$ must be divisible by 5
Since $A$ is a base $7$ digit, it follows that $A = 3$ and $C = 1$
This yields the value $n = 361_7 = 3 \cdot 7^2 + 6 \cdot 7 + 1 = 190$
The largest possible value of $n$ in base $10$ is $\boxed{247}$.
If $n$ is a two-digit number, then we can write $n$ in the form $10a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits
Then the last digit of $n^2$ is the same as the last digit of $b^2$.
The last digit of $n^2$ is 1
We know that $b$ is a digit from 0 to 9
Checking these digits, we find that the units digit of $b^2$ is 1 only for $b = 1$ and $b = 9$.
If $b = 1$, then $n = 10a + 1$, so \[n^2 = 100a^2 + 20a + 1.\] The last two digits of $100a^2$ are 00, so we want the last two digits of $20a$ to be 00
This occurs only for the digits $a = 0$ and $a = 5$, but we reject $a = 0$ because we want a two-digit number
This leads to the solution $n = 51$.
If $b = 9$, then $n = 10a + 9$, so \[n^2 = 100a^2 + 180a + 81 = 100a^2 + 100a + 80a + 81.\] The last two digits of $100a^2 + 100a$ are 00, so we want the last two digits of $80a + 81$ to be 01
In other words, we want the last digit of $8a + 8$ to be 0
This only occurs for the digits $a = 4$ and $a = 9$
This leads to the solutions $n = 49$ and $n = 99$.
Therefore, the sum of all two-digit positive integers whose squares end with the digits 01 is $51 + 49 + 99 = \boxed{199}$.
Recall that the common divisors of two integers are precisely the divisors of the greatest common divisor
So, for two numbers to have exactly three positive divisors in common, those divisors must be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$ such that $p$ is prime
We now look at the prime factorization of $90$: $90=2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$
Since $3^2$ is the only perfect square divisor of $90$, the divisors that $90$ and $m$ share must be $1$, $3$, and $9$
The largest of these three numbers is $\boxed{9}$.
The product of the three integers is equivalent in modulo 5 to the product of the modulo 5 residues of the three integers
We multiply these residues to find the remainder: $$ 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \equiv 6 \equiv \boxed{1} \pmod{5}
This expression $n!$, is the number you get by multiplying $n$ by $(n-1)$ by $(n-2)$ by $(n-3)$ and so on, all the way down to $1$
So $5! = (5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = 120$
Notice that $5!$ ends in a $0$ since it has a factor of $10$ (there is a $5$ and a $2$ in it list of factors) and that $10!$ has to end in two zeroes since it has a factor of $10$, $5$ and $2$ which is really a factor of $100$
Since any factorial greater than $10$ (such as $13!$ or $21!$) includes all of the factors of $10!$, the last two digits of $13!$, $21!$, and so on are zeroes
These terms, therefore will not affect the last two digits of the sum of the Fibonacci factorial series.
To find the last two digits, you only need to find the last two digits of each of the terms of $1! + 1! + 2! + 3! + 5! + 8!$
We do not need to calculate $8!$, only to find its last two digits
Starting with $5!$, we can work our way to $8!$, using only the last two digits of each value along the way
We know $5! = 120$, so use $20$ when finding $6!$, which will bring us to $6(20) = 120$ or $20$
Therefore, the last two digits of $7!$ are from $7(20) = 140$ or $40$
Finally $8!$ is $8(40) = 320$ or finally $20$
The last two digits of the entire series will come from $1 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 20 + 20 = 50$
Therefore, the sum of the last two digits is $5 + 0 = \boxed{5}$.
Each member in the set is of the form $(x-1)+x+(x+1)=3x$
Since $x$ can be any positive integer, the greatest common divisor of all these members is $\boxed{3}$.
Let's find the prime factorization of 1512: $1512=2^3\cdot189=2^3\cdot3^3\cdot7$
The only two squares of primes that divide 1512 are $2^2=4$ and $3^2=9$
Therefore, the largest perfect square factor of 1512 is $2^2\cdot3^2=(2\cdot3)^2=\boxed{36}$.
Note that $34 \equiv -13 \pmod{47}$
Hence, \begin{align*}
34^{-1} &\equiv (-13)^{-1} \\
&\equiv (-1)^{-1} \cdot 13^{-1} \\
&\equiv (-1) \cdot 29 \\
&\equiv \boxed{18} \pmod{47}.
\end{align*}
When you divide $20$ by $3$, you get $6$ with a remainder of $2$
Therefore, he should take away $\boxed{2 \text{ pieces}}$ so he could give each of his sisters $6$ pieces.
We can write $f(x) = x(x-1) + 2010$
From here, it is clear that $f(101) = 101\cdot 100 + 2010$ and $f(100) = 100\cdot 99 + 2010$
We now use the Euclidean algorithm
\begin{align*}
&\gcd(f(101), f(100)) \\
&= \gcd(101\cdot 100 + 2010, \, \, 100\cdot 99 + 2010) \\
&= \gcd(100\cdot 99 + 2010, \, \, 101\cdot 100 + 2010 - (100\cdot 99 + 2010)) \\
&= \gcd(100\cdot 99 + 2010, \, \, 2\cdot 100) \\
&= \gcd(100\cdot 99 + 2000 + 10, \, \, 2\cdot 100) \\
& = \gcd(100\cdot 99 + 100\cdot 20 + 10, 2\cdot 100) \\
& = \gcd(100\cdot 119 + 10, \, \, 2\cdot 100) \\
& = \gcd(2\cdot 100, \, \, 100\cdot 119 + 10 - 59(2\cdot 100)) \\
& = \gcd(2\cdot 100, \, \, 100\cdot 119 + 10 - 118\cdot 100) \\
& = \gcd(2\cdot 100, \, \, 100 + 10) \\
& = \gcd(200, \, \, 110) \\
& = \gcd(90, \, \, 110) \\
& = \gcd(20, \, \, 90) \\
& = \gcd(20, \, \, 90-4\cdot 20) \\
& = \gcd(20, \, \, 10) \\
&= \boxed{10}.
\end{align*}
To form a three-digit number in base $b$ whose digits are all distinct, we must choose a first digit, a second digit, and a third digit
We have $b-1$ choices for the first digit ($1,2,3,\ldots,b-2,b-1$)
We have $b-1$ choices for the second digit ($0,1,2,\ldots,b-2,b-1$, with the first digit removed from our choices)
We have $b-2$ choices for the third digit
So, $$(b-1)^2(b-2) = 100.$$Trial and error is arguably the most reasonable way to solve this equation! Since $100=5\cdot 5\cdot 4$, the answer is $b=\boxed{6}$.
Let $n$ be the number of students in the class
When we divide $n$ by $7$, we get a remainder of $3$
Therefore, we need to add multiples of $7$ to $3$ until we get a number which, when we divide by $5$, has a remainder of $1$
When we add $28$ to $3$, we get $31$, a number that gives a remainder of $1$ when dividing by $5$
By the Chinese remainder theorem, the other integers which leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 and a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 differ from 31 by a multiple of $7\cdot 5=35$
Therefore, the only integer between 0 and 40 satisfying these conditions is 31, and there are $\boxed{31}$ students in this math class.
The largest power of $8$ that is still less than $473$ is $8^2 = 64$ and the largest multiple of $64$ that is less than $473$ is $7 \cdot 64 = 448$
Thus, when $473_{10}$ is written in base $8$, its first digit is $\boxed{7}$.
If we multiply this fraction by 10, we do not change any of the digits; we simply shift all the digits one place to the left
Therefore, if we multiply the fraction by a sufficiently large power of 10, then the first digit obtained when dividing by 129 will be the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of $\frac{1}{129}$
Observing that $100 < 129 < 1000$, we compute $\frac{1000}{129}=7 \frac{97}{129}$
So the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of $\frac{1}{129}$ is $\boxed{7}$.
The prime factorization of 240 is $2^4\cdot3\cdot5$
We want $c$ to be as small as possible, so $c=2$
Now we have $a\cdot b=2^3\cdot3\cdot5=120$
For the maximum $b$, we seek the minimum $a$ while $b<a$
If $b<a$ then $a\cdot b<a^2$, so $120<a^2$
That means $a$ is at least 11
However, 11 is not a factor of 240
The least factor of 240 greater than 11 is $2^2\cdot3=12$
So the minimum $a$ is 12 and that makes the maximum $b=\frac{2^3\cdot3\cdot5}{2^2\cdot3}=2\cdot5=\boxed{10}$.
We use the identity $\gcd(a,b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$
We are told that $\gcd(a,b) = 18$, and $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 3780$, so $ab = 18 \cdot 3780$
If one number is 180, then the other number is $18 \cdot 3780/180 = \boxed{378}$.
We know that the rule for divisibility by $3$ is that the digits of the number must add up to a multiple of $3$
So, it's clear that there are no other such two-digit numbers beyond the ones listed in the problem
Every number divisible by $3$ between $100$ and $199$ is in the sequence, so that gets us through the $39$th term of the sequence
Using the rule for divisibility by $3$, it is fairly simple to list out the remaining $11$ terms of the sequence: $201, 210, 213, 216, 219, 231, 261, 291, 312, 315, 318$
Thus, the $50$th term is $\boxed{318}$.
Let $n$ be the number of packs of hot dogs that Phil bought
Then $10n \equiv 4 \pmod{8}$, which reduces to $2n \equiv 4 \pmod{8}$
This congruence tells us that $2n = 8k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $n = 4k + 2$
The second smallest positive integer of this form is $\boxed{6}$.
The remainder when $37+49+14$ is divided by $12$ is the same as the remainder when the congruences of each number mod 12 are summed and then divided by 12
In other words, since we have \begin{align*}
37 &\equiv 1\pmod{12}\\
49 &\equiv 1\pmod{12} \\
14 &\equiv 2\pmod{12}
\end{align*}then therefore, $37+49+14 \equiv1+1+2 \equiv \boxed{4}\pmod{12}$.
September has 30 days
September 4 is a Monday, so September 9 is a Saturday
Since September 30 is exactly 21 days later (or 3 weeks), September 30 is also a Saturday.
Then October 1 is a Sunday, and October 2 is a Monday
Then October 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 are all Mondays, so the first Marvelous Monday is $\boxed{\text{October 30}}$.
We use long division to find that the decimal representation of $\frac{12}{37}$ is $0.\overline{324}$
When $308$ is divided by $3$ there is a remainder of $2$ $\left( 308\div 3=102 \ R2\right)$
Therefore the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point is the second digit of $324$, which is $\boxed{2}$.
Since $77=7\cdot11$, the divisors of 77 are 1, 7, 11, and 77
Their sum is $1+7+11+7\cdot11=\boxed{96}$.
A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\leq a \leq 4$ and $0\leq b\leq 9$
A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even
A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1
Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\times5=\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions.
An integer is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$
Using this fact, we find that the greatest multiple of $9$ that is less than $-1111$ is $-1116$.
We have $-1111 = -1116+5$
That is, $-1111$ is equal to a multiple of $9$ plus $5$
Therefore, $$-1111\equiv \boxed{5}\pmod 9.$$To verify this answer, we can check that $9$ divides $(-1111)-5 = -1116$; it does, so our answer is correct.
The prime factorization of $1100$ is $2^2\cdot5^2\cdot11$
To find the number of factors, we consider that each factor has a prime factorization of $2^a\cdot5^b\cdot11^c$, where $a$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), $b$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), and $c$ could be $0$ or $1$ (2 possible values)
So the number of factors is $3\cdot3\cdot2=\boxed{18}$.
Let's find the cycle of units digits of $3^n$, starting with $n=1$ (note that the tens digit 2 in 23 has no effect on the units digit): $3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1,\ldots$
The cycle of units digits of $23^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 3, 9, 7, 1
Thus, to find the units digit of $23^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 3, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 9, etc.) Since $23\div4=5R3$, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is $\boxed{7}$.
For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9
But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even
Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18
This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0
This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9
So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\boxed{1089}$.
Prime factorize $72$ as $2^3\cdot 3^2$
A positive integer is a factor of 72 if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are less than or equal to the corresponding exponents in the prime factorization of 72
Also, a positive integer is a perfect cube if and only if every exponent is a multiple of 3
Therefore, in forming a perfect cube factor of 72, we have 2 choices for the exponent of $2$ (either 0 or 3) and only 1 choice for the exponent of 3 (namely 0)
There are $2\cdot 1=\boxed{2}$ ways to make these choices.
$x$ must be a divisor of 2007
To count the number of divisors, we note that a divisor can have zero factors of 3, one factor, or two factors, and (independently) it can have zero factors of 223 or one factor
The total number of divisors is then $3\cdot2=6$ (3 choices for the factors of 3 and 2 choices for the factors of 223)
Since each divisor is unique, each creates a unique ordered pair
So there are $\boxed{6}$ ordered pairs.
We can re-write the problem as the following three equations: $$k = 17a+1\\k = 6b+1 \\ k = 2c + 1$$Therefore, $k-1$ is divisible by $17,$ $6,$ and $2.$ The smallest positive value of $k-1$ is thus $$\text{lcm}[17,6,2] = \text{lcm}[17,6] = 17\cdot 6 = 102,$$and so the smallest possible value of $k$ is $k = 102+1 = \boxed{103}.$
One way to do this is to find each inverse explicitly: \begin{align*}
(3^{-1}+5^{-1}+7^{-1})^{-1} &\equiv (4+9+8)^{-1} \pmod{11} \\
&\equiv 21^{-1} \pmod{11} \\
&\equiv 10^{-1} \pmod{11} \\
&\equiv \boxed{10}\pmod{11}.
\end{align*} Another way to do this is through manipulation: \begin{align*}
& (3^{-1}+5^{-1}+7^{-1})^{-1}\\
\equiv~ & (3\cdot 5\cdot 7)(3\cdot 5\cdot 7)^{-1}(3^{-1}+5^{-1}+7^{-1})^{-1}\\
\equiv~ & (3\cdot 5\cdot 7)(3\cdot 5+5\cdot 7+ 7\cdot 3)^{-1}\\
\equiv~ & 6\cdot(15+35+21)^{-1}\\
\equiv~ & 6\cdot 5^{-1}\\
\equiv~ & 6\cdot 9\\
\equiv~ & \boxed{10} \pmod{11}
\end{align*}
First of all, $6$ has a remainder of $1$ when divided by $5,$ thus any power of $6$ will have a remainder of $1$ when divided by $5.$
As for $7,$ it has a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$, so let us look at the powers of $2$: \begin{align*}
2^1 &\equiv 2 \pmod{5} \\
2^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{5} \\
2^3 &\equiv 3 \pmod{5} \\
2^4 &\equiv 1 \pmod{5}.
\end{align*}Since $2^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5},$ we see that $2^{7} \equiv 2^3 \cdot 2^4 \equiv 3 \pmod{5},$ hence the remainder of $7^4$ when divided by $5$ is $3.$
Now, there is a bit of a shortcut we can use for $8.$ Since $8 \equiv -2 \pmod{5},$ we can see that $8^6 \equiv (-2)^6 \equiv 2^6 \equiv 2^2 \cdot 2^4 \equiv 4 \pmod {5},$ hence our desired remainder is $4.$
Adding them up, we have $4 + 3 + 1 \equiv \boxed{3} \pmod{5}.$
We start by writing out some powers of five modulo 7
\begin{align*}
5^1 &\equiv 5 \pmod{7} \\
5^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{7} \\
5^3 &\equiv 6 \pmod{7} \\
5^4 &\equiv 2 \pmod{7} \\
5^5 &\equiv 3 \pmod{7} \\
5^6 &\equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\end{align*}Therefore, we have that $5^6 \equiv 1$ modulo 7
Thus, $5^{2010} \equiv (5^6)^{335} \equiv 1^{335} \equiv \boxed{1}$ modulo 7.
The greatest common divisor of the three terms is $5^3$
Factoring $5^3$ out of each term and using the distributive property gives: \begin{align*}
15^3+10^4-5^5 &= 5^3\cdot3^3 + 5^3\cdot5\cdot2^4-5^3\cdot5^2 \\
&= 5^3(3^3+5\cdot2^4-5^2)\\
& = 5^3(27+80-25) \\
&= 5^3(82)=2\cdot5^3\cdot41.
\end{align*}So the largest prime factor is $\boxed{41}$.
$18=1\cdot18=2\cdot9=3\cdot6$
The sum is $1+18+2+9+3+6=\boxed{39}$.
First we notice that the hundreds digit of any integer between $500$ and $1000$ cannot be $3$ or $4$, so $3$ and $4$ must be the units and tens digits (in either the order $34$ or $43$)
Since the integer must be between $500$ and $1000$, there are $5$ choices for the hundreds digit of this integer ($5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$)
Thus, there are $2 \times 5 = \boxed{10}$ ways to form such a number.
Suppose that $n$ has $d$ divisors and that $d$ is even
Since the divisors come in pairs whose product is $n$, the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$
For example, if $n=12$ then the product of the divisors is $(1\cdot 12)(2\cdot 6)(3\cdot 4)=12^3$
If $d$ is odd, then there are $(d-1)/2$ pairs which give a product of $n$, as well as the divisor $\sqrt{n}$
So again the product of the divisors is $n^{(d-1)/2}n^{1/2}=n^{d/2}$
For example, if $n=16$, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $(1\cdot 16)(2\cdot 8)(4)=16^{5/2}$
To summarize, we have found that the product of the positive integers divisors of a positive integer $n$ is $n^{d/2}$, where $d$ is the number of divisors of $n$
Writing 729 as $3^6$, then, we have $n^{d/2}=3^6$, which implies $n^d=3^{12}$
So the possible values of $(n,d)$ are $(3,12)$, $(9,6)$, $(27,4)$, $(81,3)$ and $(729,2)$
We find that only in the third case $(n,d)=(27,4)$ is $d$ the number of divisors of $n$, so $n=\boxed{27}$.
Grady distributes his candy in groups of 9 until he no longer has any groups left
The largest number of possible pieces left is $\boxed{8},$ since if he has more than 8 he can distribute another group of 9.
We know that $\gcd(a,b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$
Hence, in this case, $ab = 200$
The prime factorization of 200 is $2^3 \cdot 5^2$, so $a = 2^p \cdot 5^q$ and $b = 2^r \cdot 5^s$ for some nonnegative integers $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$
Then $ab = 2^{p + r} \cdot 5^{q + s}$
But $ab = 200 = 2^3 \cdot 5^2$, so $p + r = 3$ and $q + s = 2$.
We know that $\gcd(a,b) = 2^{\min\{p,r\}} \cdot 5^{\min\{q,s\}}$
The possible pairs $(p,r)$ are $(0,3)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(3,0)$, so the possible values of $\min\{p,r\}$ are 0 and 1
The possible pairs $(q,s)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\min\{q,s\}$ are 0 and 1.
Therefore, the possible values of $\gcd(a,b)$ are $2^0 \cdot 5^0 = 1$, $2^1 \cdot 5^0 = 2$, $2^0 \cdot 5^1 = 5$, and $2^1 \cdot 5^1 = 10$, for a total of $\boxed{4}$ possible values.
We know that $\gcd(m,n) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$
Hence, in this case, the other number is \[\frac{(x + 5) \cdot x(x + 5)}{50} = \frac{x(x + 5)^2}{50}.\]To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.
We are told that the greatest common divisor is $x + 5$, so $x + 5$ divides 50
The divisors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50
Since $x$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 5
When $x = 5$, the other number is $5 \cdot 10^2/50 = 10$.
Note that that the greatest common divisor of 10 and 50 is 10, and $x + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10$
The least common multiple is 50, and $x(x + 5) = 5 \cdot (5 + 5) = 50$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value
Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\boxed{10}$.
Squares of perfect squares are fourth powers
$1^4=1$, $2^4=16$, and $3^4=81$ are the only fourth powers less than 100
Their sum is $1+16+81=\boxed{98}$.
We look at multiples of 8 greater than 15 and less than 25 (since adding 5 should make the number between 20 and 30)
So the multiples of 8 that we consider are 16 and 24
Adding 5, we get 21 and 29
Only 29 is a prime number so $n=\boxed{29}$.
When we divide 20 by 8, we get a remainder of 4
That means 21 will have a remainder of 5
The next number with a remainder of 5 would be $21+8=29$
When we consider 21 and 29, $\boxed{29}$ is the prime number.
We have $$2^{2005}\times5^{2007}\times3=(2\times5)^{2005}\times5^2\times3=75\times10^{2005},$$ so the sum of the digits is $7+5=\boxed{12}$.
It is easy to bash this out
Otherwise the following clever observation can be made:
\begin{align*}
&~ 1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5\cdot 6\cdot 7\cdot 8\cdot 9 \\
=&~ 1\cdot(2\cdot 6)\cdot(3\cdot 4)\cdot(5\cdot 9)\cdot(7\cdot 8)\\
=&~ 1\cdot 12\cdot 12\cdot 45\cdot 56\\
\equiv &~ 1\cdot 1\cdot 1\cdot 1\cdot 1 \pmod{11}\\
=&~ \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
$154_6 = 1\cdot6^2 + 5\cdot6^1 + 4\cdot6^0 = 36 + 30 + 4 = \boxed{70}.$
The least positive integer which is congruent to 6 (mod 11) is 6
The other positive integers which are congruent to 6 (mod 11) are $6+11$, $6+22$, $6+33$, and so on
We seek the maximum positive integer $k$ for which $6+11k<1000$
This maximal $k$ is the greatest integer less than $\frac{1000-6}{11}$, which is 90
So the set of positive integers less than 1000 which are congruent to 6 (mod 11) is  $$
\{11(0)+6, 11(1)+6, 11(2)+6, \ldots, 11(90)+6\},
$$and there are $\boxed{91}$ elements in this set (since there are 91 elements in the set $\{0,1,2,\ldots,90\}$).
We begin by reducing the factors of the product modulo 20: \begin{align*}
77 &\equiv -3\pmod{20},\\
88 &\equiv 8\pmod{20},\\
99 &\equiv -1\pmod{20}.
\end{align*}(Note that we could have used the more "standard" reductions $77\equiv 17$ and $99\equiv 19$, but the reductions above will make our computations easier.)
Now we have \begin{align*}
77\cdot 88\cdot 99 &\equiv (-3)\cdot 8\cdot(-1) \\
&= 24 \\
&\equiv \boxed{4}\pmod{20}.
\end{align*}
The decimal representation of $\frac{1}{13}$ is $0.\overline{076923}$
Since the first six digits repeat, we know that after every 6th digit the pattern will restart
Since $43\div 6 = 7 r 1$, the first 42 digits will be seven repetitions of the same pattern followed by the first digit of the pattern
Since the first digit is $\boxed{0}$, this is our final answer.
We start by testing palindromic sequences in base 4
Since the positive integer must be greater than 5, we start by analyzing $22_4$, which is $1010_2$
We then test $33_4$, which is $1111_2$
Converting to base 10, we have $33_4 = 3(4) + 3 = \boxed{15}$.
Since $T$ is divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4
Hence, the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 and its last two digits are divisible by 4
By inspection, we see that $T$ must end in 00 and therefore the smallest such $T$ is 11100
Calculating, $X = \boxed{925}$.
The largest power of 2 less than 1200 is $2^{10}=1024$, and the largest power of 2 less than 200 is $2^7=128$
So, we know that 1200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^{10}$ place followed by other digits, and 200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^7$ place followed by other digits
Since $2^{10}$ is 3 places away from $2^7$, 1200 will have $\boxed{3}$ more digits than 200 in their base-2 representations.
By the Euclidean algorithm, \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,(1729, 1768) &= \text{gcd}\,(1729, 1768 - 1729) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(1729, 39).
\end{align*}Since the sum of the digits of $1729$ is $19$, which is not divisible by $3$, it suffices to check whether or not $1729$ is divisible by $13$
We can find that it is by long division or noting that $12+1 = \boxed{13}$ divides into $1729 = 12^3 + 1^3$ using the sum of cubes factorization.
Let $a$ and $b$ be the two integers
We can use the identity $\gcd(a,b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$
Substituting gives that the answer is $36 \cdot 6 = \boxed{216}$.
Start with small exponents and look for a pattern
We have $5^1\equiv 5\pmod{8}$ and $5^2\equiv 1\pmod{8}$
We can multiply both sides of $5^2\equiv 1\pmod{8}$ by 5 to find that $5^3\equiv 5\pmod{8}$
Multiplying both sides by 5 again, we find $5^4\equiv 1\pmod{8}$
We see that every odd power of 5 is congruent to 5 modulo 8, and every even power is congruent to 1 modulo 8
Therefore, $5^{137}$ leaves a remainder of $\boxed{5}$ when divided by 8.
Write $3^{2004}$ as $(3^{4})^{501}$
Since the units digit of $3^4=81$ is 1, the units digit of any power of $3^4$ is $\boxed{1}$ as well.
Let $n$ be the greatest possible integer Jo could be thinking of
We know $n<100$ and $n=8k-1=7l-3$ for some positive integers $k$ and $l$
From this we see that $7l=8k+2=2(4k+1)$, so $7l$ is a multiple of 14
List some multiples of 14, in decreasing order: 112, 98, 84, 70, ...
Since $n<100$, 112 is too large, but 98 works: $7k=98\Rightarrow n=98-3=95=8(12)-1$
Thus, $n=\boxed{95}$.
Since the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $3:4$, there is an integer $k$ for which $A=3k$ and $B=4k$
Moveover, $k$ is the greatest common divisor of $A$ and $B$, since 3 and 4 are relatively prime
Recalling the identity $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[A,B]\cdot\gcd(A,B)=AB$, we find that $120k=(3k)(4k),$ which implies $k=120/12=\boxed{10}$.
First, convert $204_6$ to base 10 to get $204_6=2\cdot6^2+0\cdot6^1+4\cdot6^0=72+0+4=76$
Therefore, the shop has $76\div2=\boxed{38}$ benches
A number is congruent to the sum of its own digits modulo 9
(In other words, if you have a number $n$, and the sum of its digits is $m$, then $n$ and $m$ leave the same remainder when divided by 9.)
The sum of the digits of 5462 is $5 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 17$, and the sum of the digits of 17 is $1 + 7 = 8$
Therefore, the remainder when 5462 is divided by 9 is $\boxed{8}$.
We need to find the smallest integer, $k,$ that has exactly $10$ factors
$10=5\cdot2=10\cdot1,$ so $k$ must be in one of two forms:
$\bullet$ (1) $k=p_1^4\cdot p_2^1$ for distinct primes $p_1$ and $p_2.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3,$ which gives $k=2^4\cdot3=48.$
$\bullet$ (2) $k=p^9$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^9>48.$
Thus, the least positive integer with exactly $10$ factors is $\boxed{48}.$
Since $a$ is its own inverse modulo $n$, $a\equiv a^{-1}\pmod n$
Then \[a^2\equiv a\cdot a\equiv a\cdot a^{-1}\equiv \boxed{1}\pmod n.\]
To find the decimal expression, we try to get a denominator of the form $2^a\cdot5^a=10^a$, where $a$ is an integer
$$\frac{3^6}{6^4\cdot625}=\frac{3^6}{2^4\cdot3^4\cdot5^4}=\frac{3^2}{10^4}=9\cdot10^{-4}=0.0009$$So there are $\boxed{4}$ digits to the right of the decimal point.
Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$
3^1 = 3, \quad 3^2 = 9, \quad 3^3 = 27, \quad 3^4 = 81, \quad\text{and}\quad 3^5 = 243.
$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$
Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\boxed{7}$
The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.
By computing the first few $f^{(n)}(5)$, we get \begin{align*}
f^{(1)}(5)=f(5) = 3,\\
f^{(2)}(5)=f(f^{(1)}(5))=f(3)=9,\\
f^{(3)}(5)=f(f^{(2)}(5))=f(9)=4,\\
f^{(4)}(5)=f(f^{(3)}(5))=f(4)=5.
\end{align*}Thus, the desired order is $\boxed{4}$.
To find the first year after $2000$ for which the sum of the digits is $12$, take the greatest possible units digit, $9$
$2+9=11$, so take $1$ as the tens digit and $0$ as the hundreds digit
The answer is therefore $\boxed{2019}$.
Rewriting and reducing the fraction, we get $\frac{60}{2^3\cdot5^8} = \frac{2^2\cdot3\cdot5}{2^3\cdot5^8} = \frac{3}{2\cdot5^7}$
Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $2^6$, we obtain
\[\frac{3}{2\cdot5^7}\cdot\frac{2^6}{2^6} = \frac{3\cdot2^6}{2^7 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{192}{10^7} = .0000192.\]Therefore, there are $\boxed{3}$ non-zero digits to the right of the decimal point.
In order for an integer to be a square and a cube, it must also be a perfect sixth power
The only perfect sixth powers less than 100 are $1^6=1$ and $2^6=64$, so there are only $\boxed{2}$ positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube.
If $n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, then $n+6$ will also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6
If we keep adding 6 to $n$, we still have a remainder of 1
We can write $2010 = 6 \cdot 335$, so once we add 6 to $n$ 335 times, we will get that $n+2010$ has a remainder of $\boxed{1}$ when it is divided by 6.
Dividing using long division, we find that $2007=81\cdot24 + 63$, so the remainder is $\boxed{63}$.
The units digit of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9
The units digit of the square of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 9, or 5: $1^2=1$, $3^2=9$, $5^2=25$, $7^2=49$, $9^2=81$
Of every five consecutive odd, positive integers, exactly 2 end in 1 or 9, exactly 2 end in 3 or 7, and exactly 1 ends in 5
Therefore, of the squares of the first $2005=5\cdot401$ odd, positive integers, exactly $\frac{2}{5}\cdot2005=802$ end in 1, exactly $\frac{2}{5}\cdot2005=802$ end in 9, and exactly $\frac{1}{5}\cdot2005=401$ end in 5
The remaining two squares end in 1 ($1^2$) and 9 ($3^2$), respectively
Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers is the units digit of the sum $802\cdot1+802\cdot9+401\cdot5+1+9$, which is $ \boxed{5}$, the units digit of $2+8+5+0=15$.
The least base 10 number which requires six digits for its binary representation is the one whose binary representation is $100000_2$
$100000_2=1\cdot2^5=32_{10}$
Thus the answer is $\boxed{32}$.
We begin by converting $233_{10}$ into base-4
Since $4^3=64$ is the largest power of 4 that is less than 233, and $3\cdot64=192$ is the largest multiple of 64 that is less than 233, the coefficient of the $4^3$ term will be 3
From here, we are left with a remainder of $233-192=41$
The largest power of 4 that is less than this number is $4^2=16$, and the largest multiple of 16 that is less than 41 is $2\cdot16=32$
This leaves us with $41-32=9$, which we can express as $2\cdot4^1+1\cdot4^0$
So, we find that $233_{10}=3\cdot4^3+2\cdot4^2+2\cdot{4^1}+1\cdot4^0=3221_4$, which has $\boxed{2}$ odd digits.
Let the smallest common solution be $a$
The given system of congruences is \begin{align*}
a\equiv 1\equiv -1\pmod 2,\\
a\equiv 2\equiv -1\pmod 3,\\
a\equiv 3\equiv -1\pmod 4,\\
a\equiv 4\equiv -1\pmod 5.
\end{align*} Note that if $a\equiv-1\pmod 4$, then $a\equiv-1\pmod 2$ as well,  so we need only consider the final three congruences
Since $\gcd(3,4)=\gcd(4,5)=\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $$a\equiv -1\pmod{3\cdot 4\cdot 5},$$ that is, $a\equiv 59\pmod{60}$.
So $a$ has a lower bound of $59$, but $59$ also happens to satisfy all of the original congruences
Thus, $a=\boxed{59}$.
When you divide 40 days in a week by 7 days, you get a remainder of 5
Five days from Tuesday is $\boxed{\text{Sunday}}$.
Using the properties of modular arithmetic, $2011 \cdot 2012 \cdot 2013 \cdot 2014 \equiv 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4$ modulo 5
Continuing, $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \equiv 4$ modulo 5, so $2011 \cdot 2012 \cdot 2013 \cdot 2014 \equiv \boxed{4}$ modulo 5.
Firstly, the congruence can be simplified to $3(6x+1)\equiv 4\pmod p\implies 18x\equiv 1\pmod p$
This is solvable for $x$ if and only if $18$ is invertible modulo $p$, meaning $\gcd(18,p)=1$
Since the prime factors of $18$ are $2,3$, these are precisely the prime moduli for which an $x$ cannot exist since then $\gcd(18,p)>1$
Thus, the desired number is $2+3=\boxed{5}$.
The sum of the divisors of $2^i3^j$ is equal to $(1+2^1 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{i-1} + 2^i)(1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + \cdots + 3^{j-1} + 3^j) = 600,$ since each factor of $2^i3^j$ is represented exactly once in the sum that results when the product is expanded
Let $A = 1+2^1 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{i}$ and $B = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + \cdots + 3^{j}$, so that $A \times B = 600$
The prime factorization of $600$ is $600 = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2$.
Notice that $A$ is the sum of $1$ and an even number and $B$ is the sum of $1$ and a number divisible by $3$
Thus, $A$ is odd and $B$ is not divisible by $3$
It follows that $A$ is divisible by $3$ and $B$ is divisible by $2^3$
We now have three separate cases: $(A,B) = (3 \cdot 25,8), (3 \cdot 5, 8 \cdot 5), (3, 8 \cdot 25)$.
In the first case, $B = 1 + 3 + \cdots + 3^{j} = 8$; for $j = 1$, we have that $1 + 3 = 4 < 8$, and for $j = 2$, we have that $1 + 3 + 9 = 13 > 8$
Thus, this case is not possible.
For the third case, $B = 1 + 3 + \cdots + 3^{j} = 200$; for $j = 4$, then $1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 < 200$, and for $j = 5$, we have that $1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 364 > 200$
Thus, this case is also not possible.
It follows that $(A,B) = (15, 40)$, in which case we find that $i = j = 3$ works
Thus, the answer is $3 + 3 = \boxed{6}$.
The odd primes less than $2^4=16$ are $3,5,7,11,13$
Then \[3\cdot 5\cdot 7\cdot 11\cdot 13= (3\cdot 11)\cdot 7\cdot(5\cdot 13)=33\cdot 7\cdot 65\equiv 1\cdot 7\cdot 1 \equiv \boxed{7}\pmod {16}.\]
Recall that a simplified fraction has a terminating decimal representation if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 or 5.
The prime factorization of $12$ is $2^2 \cdot 3$
Therefore, $n/12$ terminates if and only if the numerator has a factor of $3$ in it to cancel out the $3$ in the denominator
Since $3$ integers from $1$ to $11$ are divisible by $3$, there are $11-3=\boxed{8}$ integers $n$ for which the fraction is a repeating decimal.
An integer that is congruent to $1 \pmod{23}$ is of the form $23n+1$.
Therefore, we form the inequality $23n+1<-999$, and find the largest possible integer $n$
We get \begin{align*}
23n+1&<-999 \\
23n&<-1000\\
n&<-\frac{1000}{23} \approx -43.48.
\end{align*} The largest possible negative integer $n$ is $-44$
We plug it in for $n$ to get $23 \cdot -44 +1 =\boxed{-1011}$.
At the beginning, there are $13n$ doughnuts
After $1$ doughnut is eaten, the number of remaining doughnuts is a multiple of $9$
Therefore, the original number of doughnuts was $1$ more than a multiple of $9$
Expressing this as a congruence, we have $$13n\equiv 1\pmod 9,$$or in other words, $n\equiv 13^{-1}\pmod 9$
Since $13\equiv 4\pmod 9$, we can also write $n\equiv 4^{-1}\pmod 9$.
Because $4\cdot 7=28\equiv 1$, we have $4^{-1}\equiv 7\pmod 9$
Therefore, $n\equiv 7\pmod 9$
We know $n$ must be a nonnegative integer, so the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\boxed{7}$.
We can check our answer: If $n=7$, then Donna started with $7\cdot 13=91$ doughnuts; after eating one, she had $90$, which is a multiple of $9$.
The smallest possible 5-digit palindrome in base 2 is $10001_2$, which is $2^4+2^0=17_{10}$
Now we try converting 17 to other bases
In base 3, we get $122_3$, and in base 4, we get $101_4$, which is a palindrome
So $\boxed{10001_2}$ works.
We claim that a number has an odd number of positive factors if and only if it is a perfect square
Indeed, for all non-square numbers $x$, we can pair each factor $f$ with another factor $\frac{x}{f}$, so there must be an even number of factors
For perfect squares, this argument fails only for $\sqrt{x}$, so there are an odd number of factors for perfect squares
Thus we seek the greatest perfect square below $100$, which is $\boxed{81}$.
We may sum in base 3 just as in base 10
For example, in the rightmost column, the digits sum to 6
Since we are working in base 3, we record the remainder 0 as the rightmost digit in the sum and carry the quotient 2 to the next column
Continuing in this way, we find $$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1_3 \\
& & & 2 & 1 & 2_3 \\
& & & & 1 & 2_3 \\
& + & & & & 1_3 \\
\cline{2-6}
& 1 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0_3, \\
\end{array}$$so the sum is $\boxed{10200_3}$.
Since $5^{23}$ and $7^{17}$ are both odd, their sum is even and therefore divisible by 2
There are no smaller primes than $\boxed{2}$, so it is the smallest prime divisor of the sum.
If $3x+7\equiv 2\pmod{16}$, then $$6\cdot (3x+7) \equiv 6\cdot 2\pmod{16}.$$Expanding out the right side, we have $$18x + 42 \equiv 12\pmod{16}.$$Reducing coefficients modulo $16$, we have $$2x + 10 \equiv 12\pmod{16}.$$Finally, adding $1$ to both sides, we get $$2x + 11 \equiv \boxed{13}\pmod{16}.$$(It's good to notice a couple of things about this solution
For one thing, why did we multiply by $6$ at the beginning? The idea is to get a $2x$ term on the left, since our goal is to compute the residue of $2x+11$
Another thing to notice is that one step in this process is not reversible
If the goal in this problem had been to solve for $x$, then it would appear from our final result that $x=1$ is a solution, yet $x=1$ doesn't actually satisfy $3x+7\equiv 2\pmod{16}$
Why not? At what step did we introduce this bogus solution?)
Since $3^3=27=2\cdot13+1$ we find that  \[3^3\equiv1\pmod{13}.\] Therefore \[3^{1999}\equiv3^{3\cdot666+1}\equiv1^{666}\cdot3\equiv3\pmod{13}.\] The remainder when $3^{1999}$ is divided by 13 is $\boxed{3}$.
The smallest four-digit palindromes have $1$ on each end
$1001$ is not divisible by $3$, nor is $1111$, but $\boxed{1221}$ is, so it is the smallest possible.
We can tell that the integer is a multiple of $9$ if the sum of its digits is a multiple of $9$
For the largest integer with even digits that is less than $10,\!000$, it must have the largest even digit, $8$, in the thousands place
So we have $8\_\_\_$
Notice that the maximum integer with even digits is $8888$
However, the digits must add up to a multiple of $9$, and more specifically, an even multiple of $9$ since all of the digits are even
The closest even multiples of $9$ are $18$ and $36$, but the sum of the maximum integer $8888$ is only $32$
So the sum of the digits must be $18$
We maximize the integer with $88\_\_$, with a sum of $16$, which leaves a sum of $2$ for the remaining digits
For the digits to be even and to maximize the integer, the tens digit must be $2$ and the units digit must be $0$
The largest integer is $\boxed{8820}$.
First, we find $150=2\cdot 3 \cdot 5^2.$ The prime factorization of a divisor of 150 must take the form $2^m3^n5^p$ for nonnegative integers $m\leq 1$, $n\leq 1$, and $p\leq 2$
The requirement that the divisor is not divisible by 5 means that we must have $p=0$
Therefore, there are $2$ possibilities for $m$ (namely, 0 or 1) and the same for $n$ for a total of $2\cdot 2=\boxed{4}$ such factors.
If $f(n) = 3$, this implies that $n = 2m^2$ for some positive integer $m$ since the only time $f(n)$ can be odd is when there is an ordered pair $(m, m)$ that cannot be reversed
We start testing values of $m$
The values $m = 1$, $m=2$, $m=3$, and $m=4$ do not give $f(n)=3$
However, when $m=5$, we get $50 = 5^2 + 5^2 = 1^2 + 7^2 = 7^2 + 1^2$
Therefore, the smallest integer $n$ for which $f(n)=3$ is $\boxed{50}$.
Factor out $12!$ from both terms: $12!+14!=12!(1+13\cdot 14)=12!\cdot 183$
Factor $183=3\cdot 61$
Since $12!$ has no prime factors greater than 11, $\boxed{61}$ is the greatest prime factor of $12!+14!$.
Converting from a decimal to a fraction, we obtain $0.abc = \frac{abc}{1000} = \frac{abc}{2^3\cdot5^3} = \frac{1}{y}$
Since $0<y\le9$ and $y$ divides into $1000$, $y$ must equal one of $1,2,4,5$ or $8$
Notice that $y\neq1$ because then $abc = 1000$, which is impossible as $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits
So, breaking down the remaining possibilities: \begin{align*}
y&=2 \Rightarrow abc = 2^2\cdot5^3 = 500 \Rightarrow a+b+c = 5+0+0=5 \\
y&=4 \Rightarrow abc = 2\cdot5^3 = 250 \Rightarrow a+b+c = 2+5+0=7 \\
y&=5 \Rightarrow abc = 2^3\cdot5^2 = 200 \Rightarrow a+b+c = 2+0+0 = 2 \\
y&=8 \Rightarrow abc = 5^3 = 125 \Rightarrow a+b+c =1+2+5 = 8.
\end{align*}Therefore, the largest possible value of $a+b+c$ is $\boxed{8}$.
The natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 6, 2, 3
The sum of their reciprocals is $1/1+1/6+1/2+1/3=6/6+1/6+3/6+2/6=12/6=\boxed{2}$.
Since 3 and 4 are relatively prime, the problem amounts to finding the greatest multiple of $3\cdot4=12$ less than 500
Since $500\div12=41R8$, our answer is $12\cdot41=\boxed{492}$.
Odd multiples of 5 have a 5 in the units place, while even multiples of 5 have a 0 in the units place
Multiples of 15 are multiples of 5, so we look at how many three-digit multiples of 15 are odd to find how many have a 5 in the units place
The three-digit multiples of 15 range from 105 to 990, or $15\times7$ to $15\times 66$
So there are $66-7+1=60$ three-digit multiples of 15
Half of them will be odd, so there are 30 odd, three-digit multiples of 15
There are $\boxed{30}$ positive, three-digit integers with a 5 in the units place that are divisible by 15.
For $5\,41G\,507\,2H6$ to be divisible by $72,$ it must be divisible by $8$ and by $9.$ It is easier to check for divisibility by $8$ first, since this will allow us to determine a small number of possibilities for $H.$
For $5\,41G\,507\,2H6$ to be divisible by $8,$ we must have $2H6$ divisible by $8.$ Going through the possibilities as in part (a), we can find that $2H6$ is divisible by $8$ when $H=1,5,9$ (that is, $216,$ $256,$ and $296$ are divisible by $8$ while $206,$ $226,$ $236,$ $246,$ $266,$ $276,$ $286$ are not divisible by $8$).
We must now use each possible value of $H$ to find the possible values of $G$ that make $5\,41G\,507\,2H6$ divisible by $9.$
First, $H=1.$ What value(s) of $G$ make $5\,41G\,507\,216$ divisible by $9?$ In this case, we need $$5+4+1+G+5+0+7+2+1+6=31+G$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $G$ is between $0$ and $9,$ we see that $31+G$ is between $31$ and $40,$ so must be equal to $36$ if it is divisible by $9.$ Thus, $G=5.$
Next, $H=5.$ What value(s) of $G$ make $5\,41G\,507\,256$ divisible by $9?$ In this case, we need $$5+4+1+G+5+0+7+2+5+6=35+G$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $G$ is between $0$ and $9,$ we know that $35+G$ is between $35$ and $44,$ and so must be equal to $36$ if it is divisible by $9.$ Thus, $G=1.$
Last, $H=9.$ What value(s) of $G$ make $5\,41G\,507\,296$ divisible by $9?$ In this case, we need $$5+4+1+G+5+0+7+2+9+6=39+G$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $G$ is between $0$ and $9,$ we have $39+G$ between $39$ and $48,$ and so must be equal to $45$ if it is divisible by $9.$ Thus, $G=6.$
Therefore, the possible pairs of values are $H=1$ and $G=5,$ $H=5$ and $G=1,$ and $H=9$ and $G=6.$ This gives two possible distinct values for the product $GH:$ $5$ and $54,$ so the answer is $\boxed{59}.$
Our goal is to count the two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ for integer values of $n$
We examine the inequality, $$ 10 \le 8n + 2 < 100
$$Subtracting 2 from all parts simplifies things: $$ 8 \le 8n < 98
$$Dividing everything by 8 isolates the possible values of $n$: $$ 1 \le n < 12\, \frac{1}{4}
$$Since $n$ can be any integer from 1 to 12, there are $\boxed{12}$ two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ (that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8).
The first two pieces of information imply that the number of students is 1 more than a multiple of 4 and 2 more than a multiple of 5
Checking numbers that are 2 more than a multiple of 5, we find that 2, 7, and 12 are not 1 more than a multiple of 4, but 17 does satisfy this condition
Moreover, 17 is also three more than a multiple of 7
Thus $\boxed{17}$ is the least positive integer satisfying all three conditions.
Remark: By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers satisfying the given conditions are of the form $17 + \text{lcm}(4,5,7)k = 17+140k$, where $k$ is an integer.
Let $x$ be the number of rows with 8 people
If we removed a person from each of these rows, then every row would contain 7 people
Therefore, $46 - x$ must be divisible by 7.
Then $x \equiv 46 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$
The first few positive integers that satisfy this congruence are 4, 11, 18, and so on
However, each row contains at least 7 people
If there were 7 or more rows, then there would be at least $7 \cdot 7 = 49$ people
We only have 46 people, so there must be at most six rows
Therefore, the number of rows with 8 people is $\boxed{4}$.
Observing that $4 \cdot 7 = 28 = 27 + 1,$ we multiply both sides of the given congruence by 7 to find $28x \equiv 91 \pmod{27}$
Since $28x\equiv x\pmod{27}$ and $91\equiv10 \pmod{27}$, we conclude that $x\equiv 10\pmod{27}$
Therefore, $\boxed{10}$ is the smallest positive integer satisfying the given congruence.
We can use the Euclidean Algorithm
\begin{align*}
&\text{gcd}\,(a^2+9a+24,a+4) \\
&\qquad=\text{gcd}\,(a^2+9a+24-(a+5)(a+4),a+4)\\
&\qquad=\text{gcd}\,(a^2+9a+24-(a^2+9a+20),a+4)\\
&\qquad=\text{gcd}\,(4,a+4).
\end{align*} Since $4$ is a factor of $a$ and thus $a+4$, the greatest common divisor is $\boxed{4}$.
There are six possible square powers of two that can divide the given number: $2^0$, $2^2$, $2^4$, $2^6$, $2^8$, and $2^{10}$
Similarly, there are seven possible square powers of three that can divide the given number, and eight possible square powers of five that can divide the given number
Therefore, there are $6 \times 7 \times 8 = \boxed{336}$ positive perfect square integers that can divide $\left(2^{10}\right)\left(3^{12}\right)\left(5^{15}\right)$.
Suppose that $N$ is a positive integer satisfying all the given conditions
Note that since $N$ gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, $N+1$ must be divisible by 5
Similarly, $N+1$ is also divisible by 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10
Thus the least possible value for $N+1$ is the least common multiple of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10
Prime factorizing these numbers, we find that their least common multiple is $2^3\cdot 3^2\cdot 5\cdot 7 = 2520$
Thus the least possible value for $N$ is $\boxed{2519}$.
Let the desired number be $a$
Then \begin{align*}
a\equiv 4\pmod 5,\\
a\equiv 6\pmod 7.
\end{align*} The first congruence means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=4+5n$
Substituting this into the second congruence yields \[4+5n\equiv 6\pmod 7\implies n\equiv 6\pmod 7\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $6$
Then $n\ge 6\implies a=4+5n\ge 34$
$\boxed{34}$ is the smallest solution since it is a lower bound of $a$ and satisfies both original congruences.
An integer $a$ has an inverse $\pmod{55}$ if and only if $\gcd(a,55)=1$
Similarly, an integer $a$ has an inverse $\pmod{66}$ if and only if $\gcd(a,66)=1$.
Since we're looking for an integer that doesn't have an inverse modulo either $55$ or $66$, we want $a$ such that $\gcd(a,55)>1$ and $\gcd(a,66)>1$
Thus $a$ must be divisible by either $5$ or $11$, and $a$ must also be divisible by either $2$, $3$, or $11$
The smallest positive integer that satisfies both properties is $\boxed{10}$.
We divide 1000 by 47 and get a remainder of 13
Therefore, if we subtract 13 from 1000, we should get an integer divisible by 47
Since $1000-13 = 987$ and 987 is divisible by 47, we can then add 47 to 987 to get the smallest four-digit integer that is divisible by 47, namely $987+47 = \boxed{1034}$.
By the Euclidean Algorithm: \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}(40304, 30203) &= \text{gcd}(40304-30203, 30203) \\
&= \text{gcd}(10101, 30203) \\
&= \text{gcd}(30203-2\cdot10101, 10101) \\
&= \text{gcd}(10001, 10101) \\
&= \text{gcd}(10101 - 10001, 10001) \\
&= \text{gcd}(100, 10001) \\
&= \text{gcd}(10001 - 100\cdot100, 100) \\
&= \text{gcd}(1, 100) \\
\end{align*}Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $40304$ and $30203$ is $\boxed{1}$
The number of stamps Jenna puts on each page must divide the number of stamps she puts into each book, so the largest possible number of stamps she puts on each page is gcd$(840, 1008) = \boxed{168}$.
We notice that $450=221+229,$ so that must be the connection
The Pythagorean Theorem tells us  \[60^2+221^2=229^2\] so \[229^2-221^2=60^2.\] The difference of squares factorization tells us  \[(229-221)(229+221)=3600\] and taken modulo 3599 we get  \[8\cdot450\equiv1\pmod{3599}.\] The answer is $\boxed{8}$.
Instead of converting to base 10 and then to base 4, we use the fact that $2^2=4$
We have $11011000_2=1\cdot2^7+1\cdot2^6+1\cdot2^4+1\cdot2^3$ $=2\cdot(2^2)^3+1\cdot(2^2)^3+1\cdot(2^2)^2+2\cdot(2^2)^1$ $=3\cdot4^3+1\cdot4^2+2\cdot4^1+0\cdot4^0=\boxed{3120_4}$.
Reducing each number modulo 8 first, we see that \begin{align*}
7145 + 7146 + 7147 + 7148 + 7149 &\equiv 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 \\
&\equiv 15 \\
&\equiv \boxed{7} \pmod{8}.
\end{align*}
Since $10389 \equiv 9 \pmod{12}$, the integer $n$ we seek is $n = \boxed{9}$.
The prime factorization of 30 is $30=2\cdot3\cdot5$
A factor of 30 can have zero or one power of 2, zero or one power of 3, and zero or one power of 5
Thus, there are $2\cdot2\cdot2=\boxed{8}$ factors of 30
The factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.
Since $21 \cdot 3 = 63 = 2 \cdot 31 + 1$, it follows that $21$ is the modular inverse of $3$, modulo $31$
Thus, $2^n \equiv 2^{21} \pmod{31}$
After computing some powers of $2$, we notice that $2^5 \equiv 1 \pmod{31}$, so $2^{21} \equiv 2 \cdot \left(2^{5}\right)^{4} \equiv 2 \pmod{31}$
Thus, $\left(2^{21}\right)^3 \equiv 2^3 \equiv 8 \pmod{31}$, and $$\left(2^{21}\right)^3 - 2 \equiv 8 - 2 \equiv \boxed{6} \pmod{31}$$Notice that this problem implies that $\left(a^{3^{-1}}\right)^3 \not\equiv a \pmod{p}$ in general, so that certain properties of modular inverses do not extend to exponentiation (for that, one needs to turn to Fermat's Little Theorem or other related theorems).
This is true if and only if $f(n):=6+3n+2n^2+5n^3+3n^4+2n^5$ is a multiple of $7$
Whether or not this is true depends only on $n$ modulo $7$
First note that the polynomial is congruent to $2n^5+3n^4+5n^3+2n^2+3n-15$ modulo $7$, which has $1$ as a root
Factoring, we get \[2n^5+3n^4+5n^3+2n^2+3n-15=(n-1)(2n^4+5n^3+10n^2+12n+15).\]Next we check each residue modulo $7$, i.e
we check this for $n=2,3,-1,-2,-3$
Since $n-1$ is not a multiple of $7$ when $n$ is not congruent to $1$ modulo $7$, we need only check the quartic factor
When $n=2$, we get $2(16)+5(8)+10(4)+12(2)+15=32+40+40+24+15=112+39=151$, which is not a multiple of $7$
When $n=-1$, we get $15-12+10-5+2=10$, which is not a multiple of $7$
When $n=-2$, we get \[32-40+40-24+15=32+15-24=8+15=23,\]which is not a multiple of $7$
When $n=3$, we get $2(81)+5(27)+10(9)+12(3)+15=162+135+90+36+15=297+126+15=312+126=438$, which is again not a multiple of $7$
Finally, when $n=-3$, we get $162-135+90-36+15=338-2(135)-2(36)=438-270-72=168-72=96$, which is again not a multiple of $7$
Thus the only possible $n$ are those congruent to $1$ modulo $7$, and furthermore note that $n \ge 7$ since $6$ is a digit
Thus the possible values of $n$ are $7m+1$ for $1 \le m \le 14$, so there are $\boxed{14}$ possible values.
We have $11=1\cdot 2^3 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 1\cdot 2^1 + 1\cdot 2^0,$ so $11=\boxed{1011_2}$.
We find the prime factorization of $4125$
$4125= 11 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^3$
Thus, we want $n!$ to have a factor of $11$, a factor of $3$, and $3$ factors of $5$
The largest prime in the factorization is $11$, so $n \ge 11$
The exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of 11! is only 2, since only the factors 5 and 10 are divisible by 5
Similarly, 12!, 13!, and 14! only have 2 fives in their prime factorizations
Since $15!$ contains a factor of $11$, a factor of $3$, and three factors of $5$, the least positive integer $n$ is $\boxed{15}$.
Noticing that $99=100-1$ we see that \[99\equiv-1\pmod{100}.\] Therefore  \[99^{36}\equiv(-1)^{36}\equiv1\pmod{100}.\] The remainder when $99^{36}$ is divided by 100 is $\boxed{1}$.
First, let us find which bases result in $555_{10}$ having four digits
We must find base b such that $b^{4}>555_{10}\geq b^{3}$
We easily determine that b can range from 5 to 8, inclusive
We can now try each of these four bases to see which yields a number in the form ABAB
For base six, we find that $6^{3}=216$, which can go into 555 only two times at most, leaving $555-2\cdot216 = 123$ for the next three digits
$6^{2}=36$ goes into 123 three times at most, leaving us with $123-3\cdot36 = 15$
Then, $6^{1}=6$ goes into 15 two times at most, leaving $15-2\cdot6 = 3$ for the ones digit
So, the base $\boxed{6}$ equivalent of $555_{10}$ is $2323_{6}$, which satisfies all of the requirements stated.
Since the units digits of $n!$ is always 0 when $n$ is an integer greater than 4, we just sum the first few factorials to get our answer: $1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33$, so $\boxed{3}$ is the units digit.
To find the number of terminal zeros, we must find the number of products $2\times5$ in $236!$
Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, we can get our answer by finding the largest power of 5 that divides $236!$
Every multiple of 5 less than 236 gives a factor of 5, each multiple of 25 gives an additional factor of 5, and each multiple of 125 gives a third factor of 5
Therefore, the number of factors of 5 in $236!$ is $\left\lfloor\frac{236}{5}\right\rfloor+ \left\lfloor\frac{236}{25}\right\rfloor+ \left\lfloor\frac{236}{125}\right\rfloor = 47+9+1=57$
The highest power of 5 that divides $236!$ is $5^{57}$ so $236!$ ends in $\boxed{57}$ zeros.
For the greatest common divisor of 15 and $n$ to be equal to 3, $n$ must be divisible by 3 but not divisible by 5
In other words, $n$ is divisible by 3, but not by 15.
The greatest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 100 is 99, so there are $99/3 = 33$ multiples of 3 from 1 to 100
We must subtract from this the number of multiples of 15 from 1 to 100.
The greatest multiple of 15 that is less than or equal to 100 is 90, so there are $90/15 = 6$ multiples of 15 from 1 to 100
Therefore, there are $33 - 6 = \boxed{27}$ numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 3, but not 15.
An integer is divisible by $8$ if and only if the number formed from its last three digits is divisible by $8$
Thus, the number of possibilities for the last three digits is equal to the number of three-digit multiples of $8$
Since $1000 = 8\cdot 125$, we find that there are $125$ such multiples
Since the thousands digit of our four-digit integer must be nonzero, there are $9$ possibilities for the thousands digit
Altogether, $9 \cdot 125 = \boxed{1125}$ four-digit integers are divisible by $8$.
The only numbers that leave no remainder when divided by $5$ are those that are divisible by $5$
Starting from $1,$ every five integers is divisible by $5: 5,10,15,\ldots$ This continues even until the last group of five numbers $96$ through $100$ where $100$ is divisible by $5$
Therefore, since we have a whole number of groups of five and every group has exactly one element that is divisible by $5$, $1/5 = \boxed{20}$ percent of the integers less than $100$ have no remainders when divided by $5$.
The product of the list $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19)=(2^4)(17)(2\cdot3^2)(19)$
Every value must be at most 26, so we cannot change the primes 17 and 19
However, $(2^4)(2\cdot3^2)=(2^2\cdot3)(2^3\cdot3)=(12)(24)$, which represents $LX$
Thus, the four-letter list with a product equal to that of $PQRS$ is $\boxed{LQSX}$.
Since the clock reads the same time every 12 hours, we find the remainder after dividing 122 hours by 12 hours, which is 2 hours
Counting forward from midnight, the clock will read 2:39:44, so $A+B+C = \boxed{85}$.
There are 7 days in a week
Two days of the year fall on the same day of the week if and only if they are congruent modulo 7
Notice that  \[284\equiv4\pmod7\] and  \[25\equiv4\pmod7.\] Therefore the 284th day and the 25th day fall on the same day of the week
Therefore the 284th day of the year falls on a $\boxed{\text{Saturday}}$.
Since $23_b = 2b + 3$ and $b > 3$, $23_b$ can be any odd integer greater than $2(3) + 3 = 9$
We are looking for the next smallest odd perfect square, which is $5^2 = 25$
Since $2b + 3 = 25$, $b = \boxed{11}$ is our answer.
If there are $s$ students, then $s-1$ must be divisible by 6
In other words, we want to find the sum of all values of $s$ for which $s-1\equiv 0\pmod{6}$
The multiples of 6 in the given range are 150, 156, ..., 198, so the possible values of $s$ are 151, 157, ..., 199
Recalling that the sum of an arithmetic series is  \[
\frac{(\text{first term}+\text{last term})(\text{number of terms})}{2},
\]we find that these integers sum to $(151+199)(9)/2=\boxed{1575}$.
Multiply numerator and denominator of $\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ by $5^{10}$ to see that $\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is equal to $\frac{5^{10}}{10^{10}}$
This shows that the decimal representation of $\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is obtained by moving the decimal point ten places to the left in the decimal representation of $5^{10}$
Since $5^{10}$ has a units digit of 5 (as does every positive integer power of 5), we find that the last digit in the decimal expansion of $\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is $\boxed{5}$.
A perfect square that is a multiple of $20 = 2^2 \cdot 5^1$ must be a multiple of $2^2 \cdot 5^2 = 100$
A perfect cube that is a multiple of 20 must be a multiple of $2^3 \cdot 5^3 = 1000$
Our goal is thus to count the multiples of 20 from 100 to 1000 inclusive: $$ 100 \le 20n \le 1000
$$Dividing this entire inequality by 20 we get $5 \le n \le 50$, so there are $50 - 5 + 1 = \boxed{46}$ integers in Cameron's list.
We compute the powers of 5 modulo 1000: \begin{align*}
5^0&\equiv1\pmod{1000}\\
5^1&\equiv5\pmod{1000}\\
5^2&\equiv25\pmod{1000}\\
5^3&\equiv125\pmod{1000}\\
5^4&\equiv625\pmod{1000}\\
5^5&\equiv125\pmod{1000}.
\end{align*} This pattern repeats every two terms starting at the 4th term
In particular, when $n>2$, and $n$ is odd,  \[5^n\equiv125\pmod{1000}.\] Therefore the rightmost digit of $5^{1993}$ is $\boxed{125}$.
First, we find the prime factorization of $180$ to be $2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$
Note that the odd divisors of 180 are precisely the integers of the form $3^a5^b$ where $0\leq a \leq 2$ and $0\leq b\leq 1$
Note also that distributing $(1+3+9)(1+5)$ yields 6 terms, with each integer of the form $3^a5^b$ appearing exactly once
It follows that the sum of the odd divisors of 180 is $(1+3+9)(1+5)=13 \cdot 6 = \boxed{78}$.
We are asked to find the positive difference between 40305 and the least palindrome greater than 40305
The only five-digit palindrome beginning with 403 is 40304, which is less than 40305
The next smallest possibility for the first three digits is 404, which gives the palindrome 40404
The difference between 40404 and 40305 is $\boxed{99}$.
For a number to be divisible by $33$, it needs to be divisible by both $11$ and $3$.
For an integer $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ must be divisible by $11$
For it to be divisible by $3$, then $a+b+c+d$ must be divisible by $3$.
For our digits to be as small as possible, we want $a-b+c-d$ to be equal to $0$
So $a+c=b+d$
We set $a+c=b+d=x$
Thus, we also have that $2x$ must be divisible by $3$
The smallest even positive integer that's divisible by $3$ is $6$, so $x=3$
Thus we have $a+c=3$ and $b+d=3$.
For a number to be as small as possible, we want the left digits to be as small as possible
The smallest number $a$ could be is $1$, so $c=2$
For $b$ and $d$, we want $b$ to be as small as possible since it's a larger place than $d$, so $b=0$ and $d=3$
Therefore, we have the number $\boxed{1023}$.
We first try a hundreds digit of $9$
Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$
If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit
Thus, the tens digit is odd
Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \nmid 972, 5 \nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\boxed{936}$.
To find the sum, we compute the first few cubes modulo 6: \begin{align*}
1^3 &\equiv 1, \\
2^3 &\equiv 8 \equiv 2, \\
3^3 &\equiv 27 \equiv 3, \\
4^3 &\equiv 64 \equiv 4, \\
5^3 &\equiv 125 \equiv 5, \\
6^3 &\equiv 0 \pmod{6}.
\end{align*}We see that $n^3 \equiv n \pmod{6}$ for all integers $n$, so \begin{align*}
1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \dots + 100^3 &\equiv 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 100 \\
&\equiv \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} \\
&\equiv 5050 \\
&\equiv \boxed{4} \pmod{6}.
\end{align*}
Let $d$ be the last digit of a number $n$
Then $n^2 \equiv d^2 \pmod{10}$, so the units digit of $n^2$ is the same as the units digit of $d^2$
Checking all the digits from 0 to 9, we find that the possible units digits of $d^2$ are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9, for a total of $\boxed{6}$.
The prime factorization of $91$ is $7 \cdot 13$
It follows that the sum of the divisors of $91$ is equal to $(1 + 7)(1 + 13)$, as each factor of $91$ is represented when the product is expanded
It follows that the answer is equal to $(1 + 7)(1 + 13) = (8)(14)$, or $\boxed{112}$.
First, we need to add up the digits in his phone number to see what the digits in his address add up to
$2+7+1+3+1+4+7=25$.
For his address, we want to find the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to $25$
Because we want a large number, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible, so the first digit should be $9$
The next three digits, therefore, must add up to $25-9=16$
Since the digits must be unique, the next digit cannot be $9$, so we will go for the next largest number, $8$
The final two digits must add up to $16-8=8$, and since neither can be $8$, the next largest possibility for those numbers is $7$ and $1$
Therefore, Sam's address is $\boxed{9871}$.
Since 1001 is $7\cdot11\cdot13$, we know that 1001 is a multiple of 13
The greatest 3-digit multiple of 13 is therefore \[1001-13=\boxed{988}.\]
First, we have $$53_6=5\cdot6^1+3\cdot6^0=33_{10}.$$ and  $$113_b=1\cdot b^2+1\cdot b^1+3\cdot b^0=(b^2+b+3)_{10}.$$ Therefore, we must have $b^2+b+3=33$, so $b^2+b-30=0$
Factoring we have $(b-5)(b+6)=0$
Thus, $b=5$ or $b=-6$
The positive value is $b=\boxed{5}$.
5002 factors to $2 \cdot 41 \cdot 61$, which sums to 104
Since 2 is the only even prime number, and we need the sum of these 3 distinct primes to be even, 2 must be one of these primes, meaning we need to look at pairs of primes that sum to 102
We start with 3, subtract that from 102, and see if the resulting number is prime
We need check only primes up to 51 in this manner because if the prime is greater than 51, its corresponding prime would be less than 51, meaning we would have found the pair already
In this manner, we find the following 7 different pairs: $(5,97);(13,89);(19,83);(23,79);(29,73);(31,71);(43,59)$, and thus, there are $\boxed{7 \text{ distinct integers}}$.
An amount in quarters is 0, 25, 50, or 75 cents
If George still needs 3 pennies, then the possible amounts of change he needs are 3, 28, 53, or 78 cents
With dimes, the remainder when the amount is divided by 10 is 8
So the only possible amounts George could be getting are 28 cents or 78 cents, which add up to $\boxed{106}$ cents.
To find the $x$-intercept, we plug in $0$ for $y$ and solve $$3x\equiv 4(0)-1 \pmod{35}.$$Multiplying both sides by $12$, we get $$36x \equiv -12\pmod{35}$$and thus $x\equiv -12\pmod{35}$
Translating this to the interval $0\le x<35$, we have $x\equiv 23\pmod{35}$, so the $x$-intercept on our graph is at $(23,0)$.
To find the $y$-intercept, we plug in $0$ for $x$ and solve $$3(0)\equiv 4y-1 \pmod{35}.$$We can rewrite this as $$1\equiv 4y\pmod{35}.$$Multiplying both sides by $9$, we get $$9\equiv 36y\pmod{35},$$and thus $y\equiv 9\pmod{35}$
So the $y$-intercept is at $(0,9)$.
We have $x_0+y_0 = 23+9 = \boxed{32}$.
Since 19 is close to 20 and $20\cdot50=1000$, we consider \[19\cdot50=950.\] From here we skip-count by 19s: \[950,969,988,1007,\ldots\] The largest three-digit multiple of 19 is $\boxed{988}$.
The number must be even and divisible by 3
Counting down from 999, the first number that satisfies both these properties is $\boxed{996}$.
If we first get a "common denominator" as if 2, 5, 8, and 11 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\frac 25 + \frac{8}{11} \equiv \frac{2 \cdot 11 + 8 \cdot 5}{55} \equiv \frac{62}{-1} \equiv -62 \equiv \boxed{50} \pmod{56}.$$Indeed, we can justify this manipulation as follows
Suppose that $n \equiv 2 \cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \cdot 11^{-1} \pmod{56}$; then multiplying both sides of the congruence by $55$ (which is relatively prime with $56$) yields that $-n \equiv 55n \equiv 22 + 40 \equiv 62 \pmod{56}$.
The prime factorization of $200$ is $2^3 \cdot 5^2$
It follows that $N = (1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3)(1 + 5 + 5^2)$, as each factor of $200$ is represented when the product is expanded
It follows that $N = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 5 + 25) = (15)(31)$
The largest prime factor is $\boxed{31}$.
When adding the rightmost binary digits, we notice that $1+1+0+1$ will yield a rightmost digit of $1$ in the sum, and a $1$ will be carried over
The next sum is equal to $1+1,$ yielding a digit of $0$ and a carry-over of $1.$ In the next digit, we must sum up $1+1+1+1,$ which is equal to $100_2,$ so we must this time carry-over a $2.$ The same thing happens for the next digit
Thus, the sum becomes: $$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \stackrel{2}{1} & \stackrel{2}{1} & \stackrel{1}{1} & \stackrel{1}{0} & \stackrel{}{1}_2 \\ && & & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0_2 \\ && & & & 1 & 0 & 1_2 \\ &+ & & & & & 1 & 1_2 \\ \cline{2-8} && 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1_2 \\ \end{array} $$ The sum is therefore $\boxed{110001_2}.$
The two rightmost columns do not result in any carrying; however, in the third column there is a residue of $1$
Subtracting $1$ from the sum of $4$ and $5$, we see that $h$ is $\boxed{8}$.
The decimal representation of $\frac{5}{7}$ is $0.\overline{714285}$, which has a repeating block of 6 digits
Since 4 is one of those six digits that keep repeating, the probability that the selected digit is a 4 is $\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$.
First we note that no prime number is abundant since the sum of the proper factors of any prime is 1
Analyzing the remaining numbers, we find that 12 ($1+2+3+4+6=16>12$), 18 ($1+2+3+6+9=21>18$), 20 ($1+2+4+5+10=22>20$), and 24 ($1+2+3+4+6+8+12=36>24$) are abundant numbers
Thus, $\boxed{4}$ numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers.
The pattern repeats every $1+1+2+1+1=6$ beads
Since $72=6\cdot12$, the 72nd bead will blue (the final bead to complete a pattern)
The 73rd will be red, so the 74th will be $\boxed{\text{orange}}$.
$20!=20\cdot19\cdot18\cdot...\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1$ is divisible by every prime less than 20
There are $\boxed{8}$ such primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.
If we number the girls 1, 2, 3, $\dots$, so that Ami is number 1, and she passes the ball first to girl number 5, then the numbers of the girls with the ball are 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 10, 3, 7, 11, 4, 8, 1
Hence, the ball must be thrown $\boxed{11}$ times before it returns to Ami.
The prime factorization of 135 is $3^3 \cdot 5$, and the prime factorization of 468 is $2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 13$
Therefore, the least common multiple of 135 and 468 is $2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5 \cdot 13 = \boxed{7020}$.
If $10 \star x = n$ a positive integer, then $10^2 = 100 = nx$
In other words, $x$ must be a positive integer divisor of 100
Since 100 factors as $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, its exponents tell us that it has $(2+1)(2+1) = \boxed{9}$ positive divisors.
Note that $x+1$ is divisible by $4$, $5$, and $6$
Therefore, it must be divisible by their least common multiple, which is $60$
Therefore, the smallest value for $x+1$ is $60$ and the smallest possible value for $x$ is $\boxed{59}$.
Let the given sum be $S$
By inspection, we find that $2^6 \equiv 64 \equiv -1 \pmod{13}$, so $2^{-6} \equiv (-1)^{-1} \equiv -1 \pmod{13}$
It follows that $2^{-5} \equiv 2 \cdot 2^{-6} \equiv 2 \cdot -1 \equiv -2 \pmod{13}$, and that $2^{-4} \equiv -4 \pmod{13}$, and so forth
Thus, $$S \equiv -2^5 - 2^4 - 2^3 - 2^2 - 2 - 1 \equiv -63 \equiv \boxed{2} \pmod{13}$$
By inspection, we find that  \begin{align*}
1\cdot 1 &\equiv 1\pmod{9} \\
2\cdot 5 &\equiv1\pmod{9} \\
4\cdot 7 &\equiv 1 \pmod{9} \\
8\cdot 8 &\equiv 1\pmod{9}.
\end{align*}So 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have modular inverses (mod 9)
Since no multiple of 0, 3, and 6 can be one more than a multiple of 9, we find that $\boxed{6}$ of the modulo-9 residues have inverses.
If $\frac{3}{11}=0.ababab\ldots$, then, by multiplying both forms of this number by 100, we get $\frac{300}{11}=ab.ababab\ldots$
Now we can subtract:
$$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&300/11 &=& ab&.ababab\ldots \\
- &3/11 &=& 0&.ababab\ldots \\
\hline
&297/11 &=& ab &
\end{array}$$
We can simplify $\frac{297}{11}$ to $27$, giving us the two digits we sought: $a=2$ and $b=7$
Thus, $a+b = 2+7 = \boxed{9}$.
(Alternatively, we could solve this problem by long division.)
Let $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$ be three consecutive integers
Their sum is $(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n$, which is always divisible by $\boxed{3}$, but not necessarily by any other prime.
We can test an integer for divisibility by $11$ by alternately adding and subtracting its digits
For example, $8162$ is divisible by 11 because $8-1+6-2=11$ is divisible by 11
In this case, $2A-2B+C$ must be divisible by 11
If there are satisfactory values of $B$ and $C$ corresponding to $A=9$, then the resulting integer would be larger than any integer with $A<9$
Therefore, we try $A=9$ first
If $A=9$, then $C-2B+18$ must be divisible by $11$
Equivalently, $C-2B$ equals $-7$ or $4$, which implies $C=2B-7$ or $C=2B+4$
Wanting to make $B$ as large as possible, we try $B=9,8,7,\ldots$
$B$ cannot be $9$ because $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct
If $B=8$, then $C=9$, so again the digits are not distinct
If $B=7$, then $C=7$ and still the digits are not distinct
If $B=6$, then $C=5$, and $AB,\!CBA=\boxed{96,\!569}$.
By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we may count the number of even divisors of $7!$ by counting the number of ways to form the prime factorization of an even divisor of $7!$
Suppose that $7!$ is divisible by an even positive integer $r$
Since the prime factorization of $7!$ is $7\cdot(2\cdot3)\cdot5\cdot(2\cdot2)\cdot3\cdot2=2^4\cdot3^2\cdot5\cdot7$, the prime factorization of $r$ does not include any primes other than $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$
Express $r$ in terms of its prime factorization as $2^a3^b5^c7^d$
Then $7!/r=2^{4-a}3^{2-b}5^{1-c}7^{1-d}$
Since $7!/r$ is an integer, $d$ must equal $0$ or $1$, $c$ must equal $0$ or $1$, and $b$ must equal $0$, $1$ or $2$
Finally, $a$ may be no larger than $4$, but it must be at least $1$ since $r$ is even
Altogether there are $2\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4=48$ total possibilities for the four exponents $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, and hence $\boxed{48}$ even divisors.
Since a terminating decimal can be written in the form of $\frac{a}{10^b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, we want to rewrite our fraction with a denominator of $10^b=2^b\cdot5^b$
\[ \frac{37}{80}=\frac{37}{2^{4}\cdot5}\cdot\frac{5^{3}}{5^{3}}=\frac{37\cdot5^{3}}{10^{4}}=\frac{4625}{10^{4}}=\boxed{0.4625}
$\frac{n+18}{n}=1+\frac{18}{n}$
Thus, $\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer if and only if $n|18$
The positive factors of 18 are 1, 18, 2, 9, 3, and 6
Their sum is $\boxed{39}$.
We can start from 9 and keeping adding 10 until we reach an integer divisible by 7
It turns out that 9, 19, 29, and 39 are all not divisible by 7, but 49 is divisible by 7
Therefore, $\boxed{49}$ is the smallest integer that ends in a 9 and is divisible by 7.
The base 5 number $34x1_5$ is equal to $3 \cdot 5^3 + 4 \cdot 5^2 + x \cdot 5 + 1 = 5x + 476$
The base-5 digit $x$ must be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4
Among these values, only $x = \boxed{4}$ makes $5x + 476$ divisible by 31.
For $992\,466\,1A6$ to be divisible by $8,$ we must have $1A6$ divisible by $8.$ We check each of the possibilities, using a calculator or by checking by hand:
$\bullet$ $106$ is not divisible by $8,$ $116$ is not divisible by $8,$ $126$ is not divisible by $8,$
$\bullet$ $136$ is divisible by $8,$
$\bullet$ $146$ is not divisible by $8,$ $156$ is not divisible by $8,$ $166$ is not divisible by $8,$
$\bullet$ $176$ is divisible by $8,$
$\bullet$ $186$ is not divisible by $8,$ $196$ is not divisible by $8.$
Therefore, the possible values of $A$ are $3$ and $7.$ Thus, the answer is $7+3=\boxed{10}.$
Notice that $100\equiv-1\pmod{101}$
Therefore if we have any multiple of 100, that number will be congruent to the negative of the number we get by deleting the final two zeros and changing the sign
For example \[111100\equiv-1111\pmod{101}.\]In particular, $100n\equiv -n\pmod{101}$
Therefore we want to solve \[-n\equiv72\pmod{101},\]or \[n\equiv-72\pmod{101}.\]Adding 101 does not change the residue class, so this is equivalent to \[n\equiv \boxed{29}\pmod{101}.\]
We first need to find the largest power of $2$ that divides into $16! = 16 \times 15 \times 14 \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1$
There are $8$ even numbers less than or equal to $16$, which contribute a power of $2^8$; of these, $4$ are divisible by $4$ and contribute an additional power of $2^4$; two are divisible by $8$ and contributes an additional power of $2^2$; and finally, one is divisible by $16$ and contributes an additional power of $2$
In total, the largest power of $2$ that divides into $16!$ is equal to $2^{8+4+2+1} = 2^{15}$.
Checking the ones digits of the powers of $2$, we see that the ones digit of $2^1$ is $2$, of $2^2$ is $4$, of $2^3$ is $8$, of $2^4$ is $6$, and of $2^5$ is $2$
Thus, the ones digit will repeat every $4$ exponents, and the ones digit of $2^{15} = 2^{4 \times 3 + 3}$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^3 = \boxed{8}$.
For two times to be clock equivalent, their difference must be a multiple of $12.$ We list the hours greater than $4,$ their squares, and the differences between them:  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
5 & 25 & 20\\
6 & 36 & 30\\
7 & 49 & 42\\
8 & 64 & 56\\
9 & 81 & 72\\
\hline
\end{tabular} We can stop at $\boxed{9},$ since it is the smallest hour greater than $4$ that is clock equivalent to $81,$ its square.
Write $9$ as $10-1$ and consider raising 9 to the 2004 power by multiplying out the expression \[
\overbrace{(10-1)(10-1)(10-1)\cdots(10-1)}^{2004\text{ factors}}
\] There will be $2^{2004}$ terms in this expansion (one for each way to choose either 10 or $-1$ for each of the 2004 factors of $(10-1)$), but most of them will not affect the tens or units digit because they will have two or more factors of 10 and therefore will be divisible by 100
Only the 2004 terms of $-10$ which come from choosing $-1$ in 2003 of the factors and 10 in the remaining one as well as the term $(-1)^{2004}=1$ remain
Let $N$ represent the sum of all of the terms with more than 1 factor of 10
We have \begin{align*}
(10-1)^{2004}&=N+2004(-10)+1\\
&= N-20,\!040+1 \\
&= (N-20,\!000)-40+1 \\
&= (N-20,\!000)-39.
\end{align*} So $9^{2004}$ is 39 less than a multiple of 100 and therefore ends in 61
The sum of 6 and 1 is $\boxed{7}$.
$285_{10}$ is only four digits for bases 5 and 6, since only these two bases satisfy $b^{4}>285_{10}\geq b^{3}$
Testing each of our two cases, we find that $285_{10}= 2120_{5} = 1153_{6}$, so only base $\boxed{6}$ yields a four-digit representation with an odd units digit.
Subtract 4609 from both sides of the congruence to obtain $x\equiv -2505\pmod{12}$
By dividing 2505 by 12, we find that the least integer $k$ for which $-2505+12k>0$ is $k=209$
Adding $12\cdot 209$ to $-2505$, we find that $x\equiv 3\pmod{12}$
Thus $\boxed{3}$ is the least integer satisfying the given congruence.
For the number to be as large as possible, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible
Therefore, the thousandth digit should be $9$
The other three digits would have to add up to $16-9=7$
The leftmost digit is now the hundredth digit, which should be the largest number possible, $7$
Therefore, the largest four-digit number possible is $\boxed{9700}$.
Let $a$ be the smallest common term
We know that \begin{align*}
a & \equiv 1 \pmod 6\\
a & \equiv 4 \pmod 7
\end{align*} We see that $a \equiv 1 \pmod 6$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=1+6n$
Substituting this into $a \equiv 4 \pmod 7$ yields \[1+6n\equiv 4\pmod 7\implies n\equiv 4\pmod 7\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $4$
Then $n\ge 4\implies a=1+6n\ge 25$
We see that $25$ satisfies both congruences so $a=25$
If $b$ is any common term, subtracting $25$ from both sides of both congruences gives \begin{align*}
b-25 & \equiv -24\equiv 0\pmod 6 \\
b-25 & \equiv -21\equiv 0\pmod 7
\end{align*} Since $\gcd(6,7)=1$, we have $b-25\equiv 0\pmod {6\cdot 7}$, that is, $b\equiv 25\pmod{42}.$ So $b=25+42m$ for some integer $m$
The largest such number less than $100$ is $\boxed{67}$, which happens to satisfies the original congruences.
First, we convert $0.\overline{81}$ to a fraction by the following trick
Let $x=0.\overline{81}$
Then $100x=81.\overline{81}$, so we can subtract:
$$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&100x &=& 81&.818181\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.818181\ldots \\
\hline
&99x &=& 81 &
\end{array}$$
Therefore, $x=\frac{81}{99}=\frac{9}{11}$.
At this point, we could write $0.81$ as $\frac{81}{100}$ and subtract this from $\frac{9}{11}$
However, the following observation will save us some work: \begin{align*}
0.\overline{81} - 0.81 &= 0.818181\ldots - 0.81 \\
&= 0.008181\ldots \\
&= \frac{x}{100}.
\end{align*} Therefore, $$0.\overline{81} - 0.81 = \boxed{\frac{9}{1100}}.$$
We first find that the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84$ is $2^6 = 64$
Our next step is to find the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84 - 64 = 20$ which is $2^4=16$
This leaves us left with $20 - 16 = 4$, but $4 = 2 ^2$, so we have $$84 = 1 \cdot 2^6 + 0 \cdot 2^5 + 1 \cdot 2^4 + 0 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^0.$$Thus, our base $2$ representation of $84_{10}$ is $\boxed{1010100_2}$.
Let's find the prime factorization of 159137: $159137=11\cdot14467=11\cdot17\cdot851=11\cdot17\cdot23\cdot37$
The positive difference between the two largest prime factors of 159137 is therefore $37-23=\boxed{14}$.
Note that $16^2 = 256 < 273$ while $17^2 = 289 > 273$
Since all other perfect squares are farther away from $273$, our answer is the closer of these two, $\boxed{289}$.
In order to solve this problem, we must first find the number of digits when $987_{10}$ is converted to each base
Beginning with base-3, we have that $2187>987>729$ or $3^7>987>3^6$
So, we know that the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$ has 7 digits
Similarly with base-8, we have that $4096>987>512$ or $8^4>987>8^3$
So, the base-8 representation of $987_{10}$ has only 4 digits
Therefore, the base-3 equivalent has $7-4=\boxed{3}$ more digits than the base-8 equivalent.
Noticing that 221 is close to the perfect square 225, we write 221 as a difference of two squares: $221=225-4=15^2-2^2=(15-2)(15+2)=13\cdot 17$
The largest prime factor here is $\boxed{17}$.
If an integer $n$ is not square-free, then there is a square greater than $1$ that does divide $n$
The odd squares less than $100$ are $3^2 = 9$, $5^2 = 25$, $7^2 = 49$, and $9^2 = 81$
If an integer is divisible by $81$, then it is divisible by $9$, so we will only consider $3^2$, $5^2$, and $7^2$
There are $11$ multiples of $9$ that are less than $100$
Six of them are odd and five are even
There are $3$ multiples of $25$ that are less than $100$
Two of them are odd and one is even
There are $2$ multiples of $49$ that are less than $100$
One of them is odd and one is even
Therefore, there are $9$ odd integers that are not square-free
The least integer which is divisible by at least two of the integers 9, 25, and 49 is $9\cdot 25 = 225$, which is greater than 100
Therefore, there are 9 odd integers less than 100 which are divisible by a perfect square greater than 1
There are $49$ odd integers less than $100$ and greater than 1, so there are $49-9=\boxed{40}$ odd square-free integers less than $100$.
Since a terminating decimal can be written in the form of $\frac{a}{10^b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, we want to rewrite our fraction with a denominator of $10^b=2^b\cdot5^b$
\[ \frac{31}{2\cdot5^6}\cdot\frac{2^{5}}{2^{5}}=\frac{31\cdot2^{5}}{10^{6}}=\frac{992}{10^{6}}
\]Because the denominator consists only of a $10^6$ term, there are a total of 6 digits to the right of the decimal point, the last three of which are $992$
Therefore, the decimal representation of $\frac{31}{2\cdot5^6}$ is $\boxed{0.000992}$
Since $-2187 \equiv 3 \pmod{10}$, the integer $n$ we seek is $n = \boxed{3}$.
Notice that $1001=10\cdot 100+1$
Therefore, $$10\cdot 100\equiv -1 \pmod{1001},$$which implies that $$10\cdot -100\equiv 1\pmod{1001}.$$The inverse of $10\pmod{1001}$ is $-100$, but we need an answer in the interval from $0$ to $1000$
The equivalent residue in this interval is $-100+1001 = \boxed{901}$.
We can check our answer: $10\cdot 901 = 9010 = 9(1001)+1 \equiv 1\pmod{1001}$, so $901$ is indeed the inverse of $10\pmod{1001}$.
The identity $\gcd(k,\ell)\cdot\mathop{\text{lcm}}[k,\ell] = k\ell$ holds for all positive integers $k$ and $\ell$
Thus, we have $$\mathop{\text{lcm}}[k,\ell] = \frac{k\ell}{3}.$$Also, $k$ and $\ell$ must be 4-digit multiples of $3$, so our choices for each are $$1002,1005,1008,1011,1014,\ldots,$$and by minimizing the product $k\ell$, we minimize the least common multiple of $k$ and $\ell$
However, $k$ and $\ell$ cannot both be $1002$, since their greatest common divisor would then be $1002$ (not $3$)
Setting $k=1002$ and $\ell=1005$, we obtain $\gcd(k,\ell)=3$ as desired, and we obtain the smallest possible value for the least common multiple: \begin{align*}
\mathop{\text{lcm}}[1002,1005] &= \frac{1002\cdot 1005}{3} \\
&= 1002\cdot 335 \\
&= (1000\cdot 335)+(2\cdot 335)\\
&= \boxed{335{,}670}.
\end{align*}
We use the Euclidean Algorithm
\begin{align*}
\gcd(11n+3, 6n+1) &= \gcd(6n+1, (11n+3) - (6n+1)) \\
&= \gcd(6n+1, 5n+2) \\
&= \gcd(5n+2, (6n+1)-(5n+2)) \\
&= \gcd(5n+2, n-1) \\
&= \gcd(n-1, (5n+2)-5(n-1)) \\
&= \gcd(n-1, 7).
\end{align*}Therefore, if $n-1$ is a multiple of 7, then the greatest common divisor of $11n+3$ and $6n+1$ is 7
Otherwise, the greatest common divisor is 1
This implies that the maximum possible value for the greatest common divisor of $11n+3$ and $6n+1$ is $\boxed{7}$.
If $\frac{n}{n+101}$ is a terminating decimal, then $n+101$ is divisible only by 2 and 5
We proceed by looking for integers only divisible by 2 and 5.
We find that 125 is the smallest power of 5 greater than 101
The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 25 is also 125; multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 100, then 200
The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 5 is also 125, since multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 80, then 160
Finally, the smallest power of 2 greater than 101 is 128
125 is the smallest denominator that will give a terminating decimal, so we have that $n+101 = 125$ which implies $n = \boxed{24}$.
Notice that by the sum of cubes factorization, $n^3 + 8 = (n+2)(n^2 - 2n + 4)$ is an integer divisible by $n+2$
\begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,(n^3 + 9, n+2) &= \text{gcd}\,(n^3 + 9 - (n^3 + 8), n+2) \\
& = \text{gcd}\,(1,n+2) \\
& = \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
We can write 1234567890 as \[12 \cdot 10^8 + 34 \cdot 10^6 + 56 \cdot 10^4 + 78 \cdot 10^2 + 90.\] Note that \[10^8 - 1 = 99999999 = 99 \cdot 1010101,\] is divisible by 99, so $12 \cdot 10^8 - 12$ is divisible by 99.
Similarly, \begin{align*}
10^6 - 1 &= 999999 = 99 \cdot 10101, \\
10^4 - 1 &= 9999 = 99 \cdot 101, \\
10^2 - 1 &= 99 = 99 \cdot 1
\end{align*} are also divisible by 99, so $34 \cdot 10^6 - 34$, $56 \cdot 10^4 - 56$, and $78 \cdot 10^2 - 78$ are all divisible by 99.
Therefore, \[12 \cdot 10^8 + 34 \cdot 10^6 + 56 \cdot 10^4 + 78 \cdot 10^2 + 90 - (12 + 34 + 56 + 78 + 90)\] is divisible by 99, which means that $1234567890$ and $12 + 34 + 56 + 78 + 90$ leave the same remainder when divided by 99.
Since $12 + 34 + 56 + 78 + 90 = 270 = 2 \cdot 99 + 72$, the remainder is $\boxed{72}$.
We see that the largest power of 9 that is less than 2014 is $9^3=729$, and the largest multiple of 729 less than 2014 is 1458, or $2\cdot729$
From here, we find that the largest power of nine less than $2014-1458=556$ is $9^2=81$, and the largest multiple of 81 less than 556 is 486, or $6\cdot81$
Next, the largest power of nine that is less than $556-486=70$ is $9^1=9$, giving us 63 or $7\cdot 9$ as the largest multiple of 9
Finally, this leaves us with $70-63=7$, or $7\cdot1=7\cdot9^0$
Therefore, we can express 2014 as $2\cdot9^3+6\cdot9^2+7\cdot9^1+7\cdot9^0$, which gives us $\boxed{2677_9}$.
The given information translates to the congruences \begin{align*}
n\equiv 3 & \pmod 4,\\
n\equiv 2 & \pmod 5.\\
\end{align*}From the first congruence we obtain that $n = 3+4k$ for some integer $k.$ Combining this result with the second congruence, we have $3+4k=n \equiv 2 \pmod 5.$ Therefore, $k \equiv 1 \pmod 5.$ So, $k = 1+5t$ for some integer $t.$ Substituting $1+5t$ for $k$, we have  \begin{align*}
n &=3+4k\\
&=3+4(1+5t)\\
&=7+20t \equiv 7 \pmod{20}.
\end{align*}The smallest such $n$ greater than $10$ is $\boxed{27}$.
The total number of books in the warehouse is $1335\cdot 39$
If Melvin packs $b$ boxes of $40$ books each and has $r$ books left over, then $1335\cdot 39 = 40b+r$
Thus, what we are looking for is the remainder when $1335\cdot 39$ is divided by $40$.
We note that $39\equiv -1\pmod{40}$
Therefore, we have \begin{align*}
1335\cdot 39 &\equiv 1335\cdot (-1) \\
&\equiv -1335\pmod {40}.
\end{align*}Now we note that $-1335 = -1400 + 65$, and $-1400$ is a multiple of $40$
Therefore, $-1335 \equiv 65 \equiv 25\pmod{40}$, which implies that the remainder is $\boxed{25}$ books.
If a number is divisible by 6, it must be divisible by 2 and 3
Clearly, 369,963 is not divisible by 2
However, it is divisible by 3
Thus, the remainder after dividing by 6 is an odd, non-negative multiple of 3 that is less than 6
The only number such number is $\boxed{3}$.
The two-digit primes less than 50 are 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47
For each prime on this list whose tens digit is odd, check whether or not the number formed when the digits are reversed is also prime
(Note that if the tens digit is even, then the ``reversed'' number is even and hence not prime.) The palindromic primes less than 50 are 11, 13, 17, 31, and 37, whose sum is $\boxed{109}$.
Summing the two numbers, you are left with a residue of $2$ when adding $7$ and $3$
Carrying over $1$, you once again have a residue of $2$ and carry over $1$
$$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & &_{1} & _{1}& \\ & & 3& 2 & 7_8 \\ &+ & & 7 & 3_8 \\ \cline{2-5} && 4& 2 & 2_8 \\ \end{array}$$Therefore, the sum is $\boxed{422_8}$.
Since $8^{-1} \equiv 85 \pmod{97}$, $64^{-1} \equiv (8^2)^{-1} \equiv (8^{-1})^2 \equiv 85^2 \equiv \boxed{47} \pmod{97}$.
Let $N$ be the number of marbles
We know that for some integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c,$ $$N = 6a+1,\\N = 7b+1, \\N = 8c +1.$$In other words, $N-1$ is divisible by $6,$ $7,$ and $8.$ We have $$\text{lcm}[6,7,8] = \text{lcm}[3,7,8]= 3\cdot 7\cdot 8 = 168,$$and so $168$ divides $N-1.$ The smallest possible value of $N$ greater than $1$ is $N = 168+1 = \boxed{169}.$
$M=1$, $5$, or $6$ since no other digits have the property that the units digit of $M\times M$ is $M$
Therefore, the greatest possible value of $MM\times M=NPM$ is $66\times6=\boxed{396}$.
Prime factorizing gives $n = 2^{23} \cdot 3^{12}$
Since any positive factor of $n$ must be of the form $2^a \cdot 3^b$ where $0 \le a \le 23$ and $0 \le b \le 12$, there are $(23+1)(12+1) = 24 \cdot 13 = \boxed{312}$.
Consider the first several positive integers that are one more than a multiple of 9, and check their remainders when divided by 5
One leaves a remainder of 1, 10 leaves a remainder of 0, 19 leaves a remainder of 4, and 28 leaves a remainder of 3
By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the numbers that are one more than a multiple of 9 and three more than a multiple of 5 are those that differ from 28 by a multiple of $9\cdot 5=45$
Dividing $1000-28=972$ by 45, we get a quotient of 21 and a remainder of 27
Therefore, $45\cdot 21+28=\boxed{973}$ is the largest three-digit integer which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 9 and a remainder of 3 when divided by 5.
The possible units digits of a perfect square are 0 ($0^2$), 1 ($1^2$, $9^2$), 4 ($2^2$, $8^2$), 9 ($3^2$, $7^2$), 6 ($4^2$, $6^2$), and 5 ($5^2$)
Clearly, a three-digit perfect square with 0 as the units digit is not a palindrome because its hundreds digit cannot be 0
The only perfect square palindrome with 1 as the units digit is $11^2=121$; the only perfect square palindrome with 4 as the units digit is $22^2=484$; the only perfect square palindrome with 6 as the units digit is $26^2=676$; no perfect square palindrome has 9 or 5 as the units digit
Therefore, there are $\boxed{3}$ perfect squares that are palindromes.
$4444_8=4\cdot8^3+4\cdot8^2+4\cdot8^1+4\cdot8^0=2048+256+32+4=2340_{10}$
Therefore, Kate will have $2340-1000=\boxed{1340}$ dollars for lodging and food.
We use the Euclidean algorithm
\begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,(5616,11609)&=\text{gcd}\,(5616 ,11609- 2 \cdot 5616) \\
&=\text{gcd}\,(5616, 377)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(5616-14 \cdot 377,377)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(338,377)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(338,377-338)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(338,39)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(338 - 8 \cdot 39,39)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(26,39).
\end{align*}We can easily find that the greatest common divisor of $26$ and $39$ is $\boxed{13}$.
Since 25 divides evenly into 2000 and 2007 is 7 more than 2000, the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25 is $\boxed{7}$.
Let $a$ be the least number of pennies that Joyce could have in the bank
Then \begin{align*}
a & \equiv 1\pmod 5\\
a & \equiv 2\pmod 3
\end{align*} The first few positive solutions to $a\equiv 1\pmod 5$ are $1,6,11$
Luckily, while the first two do not satisfy $a\equiv 2\pmod 3$, $\boxed{11}$ does!
We can write the condition on $t$ as $$11\cdot t \equiv 36\pmod{100}.$$Then, multiplying both sides by $9$, we have $$99\cdot t \equiv 324 \equiv 24\pmod{100}.$$The left side, $99t$, is congruent modulo $100$ to $-t$, so we have $$-t \equiv 24\pmod{100}$$and therefore $$t \equiv -24\pmod{100}.$$The unique two-digit positive solution is $t=-24+100=\boxed{76}$
Indeed, we can check that $11\cdot 76 = 836$, which does end in $36$.
Since $100=33\cdot3+1$, the first $100$ letters are $33$ copies of the $3$ letters $ABC$ followed by an $A$
The $100$th letter is $\boxed{A}$.
If $n\leq 2007$, then $S(n)\leq S(1999)=28$
If $n\leq
28$, then $S(n)\leq S(28)=10$
Therefore if $n$ satisfies the required condition it must also satisfy \[
n\geq 2007-28-10=1969.
\] In addition, $n,S(n),\text{ and }S(S(n))$ all leave the same remainder when divided by 9
Because 2007 is a multiple of 9, it follows that $n,S(n),\text{ and }S(S(n))$ must all be multiples of 3
The required condition is satisfied by $\boxed{4}$ multiples of 3 between 1969 and 2007, namely 1977, 1980, 1983, and 2001.
Note: There appear to be many cases to check, that is, all the multiples of 3 between 1969 and 2007
However, for $1987\leq n\leq 1999$, we have $n+S(n)\geq 1990+19=2009$, so these numbers are eliminated
Thus we need only check 1971, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1986, 2001, and 2004.
$12012_3=1\cdot3^4+2\cdot3^3+0\cdot3^2+1\cdot3^1+2\cdot3^0=81+54+3+2=\boxed{140}$.
After identifying a factor of 2 in 9118 and 33,182, we find that the given integers appear to be difficult to prime factorize
Therefore, we turn to the Euclidean algorithm
To use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of a set of three numbers, we first note that $\text{gcd}(a,b,c)=\text{gcd}(\text{gcd}(a,b),c)$ for integers $a$, $b$, and $c$
One way to see this is to consider the prime factorization of $a$, $b$, and $c$
Now we apply the Euclidean algorithm to the first pair of numbers to find \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}(9118,12,\!173) &= \text{gcd}(9118,12,\!173-9118) \\
&= \text{gcd}(9118,3055)
\end{align*}We could continue to apply the Euclidean algorithm as usual, but instead we note that $\text{gcd}(9118,3055)=\text{gcd}(9118,3055\div 5)$, since 9118 is not divisible by 5
We find \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}(9118,12,\!173) &= \text{gcd}(9118,3055 \div 5) \\
&= \text{gcd}(9118,611) \\
&= \text{gcd}(611,9118-611\times 15) \\
&= \text{gcd}(611,-47) \\
&= 47,
\end{align*}since long division shows that 611 is divisible by 47
Note that we chose 15 as the number of 611's to subtract from 9118 by dividing 9118 by 611 and rounding up to the nearest integer
Finally, we verify that 33,182 is divisible by 47
Altogether, we have \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}(9118, 12,\!173, 33,\!182) &= \text{gcd}(\text{gcd}(9118, 12,\!173), 33,\!182) \\ &= \text{gcd}(47, 33,\!182)\\ &=\boxed{47}.
\end{align*}
We can use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of 1407 and 903
\begin{align*}
\gcd(1407, 903) &= \gcd(903, 1407 - 903) \\
&= \gcd(903, 504) \\
&= \gcd(504, 903 - 504) \\
&= \gcd(504, 399) \\
&= \gcd(399, 504 - 399) \\
&= \gcd(399, 105) \\
&= \gcd(105, 399 - 3\cdot 105) \\
&= \gcd(105, 84) \\
&= \gcd(84, 105-84) \\
&= \gcd(84, 21) \\
&= \boxed{21}.
\end{align*}
The smallest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $1000_8$, which stands for $8^3 = 2^9$
The largest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $7777_8$, which is $1$ less than $10000_8$ and therefore stands for $8^4-1 = 2^{12}-1$.
Thus, when a $4$-digit base-$8$ integer is written in base $2$, its highest place value is either $2^9$, $2^{10}$, or $2^{11}$
It follows that the base-$2$ expression has $10$, $11$, or $12$ digits, so the sum of all possible values for $d$ is $10+11+12 = \boxed{33}$.
We try finding the remainders when increasing powers of 5 are divided by 7
\begin{align*}
5^1\div 7 &\text{ leaves a remainder of } 5.\\
5^2\div 7 &\text{ leaves a remainder of } 4.\\
5^3\div 7&\text{ leaves a remainder of } 6.\\
5^4\div 7&\text{ leaves a remainder of } 2.\\
5^5\div 7&\text{ leaves a remainder of }3.\\
5^6\div 7 &\text{ leaves a remainder of }1.\\
5^7\div 7 &\text{ leaves a remainder of } 5.\\
5^8\div 7 &\text{ leaves a remainder of }4.
\end{align*} $$\vdots$$ The remainders repeat after every 6 powers of 5
So we look for the remainder when 207 is divided by 6, which leaves a remainder of 3
We could use long division, but notice that 207 is a multiple of 3 (digits sum to 9, which is a multiple of 3) but is not a multiple of 2
That means 207 is not divisible by 6 and must be exactly 3 more than a multiple of 6
So the remainder for $5^{207}$ when divided by 7 is the same as the remainder when $5^3$ is divided by 7, which is $\boxed{6}$.
We use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor
\begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,(10293,29384) &=\text{gcd}\,(29384-2 \cdot 10293,10293)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(8798,10293)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(8798,10293-8798)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(8798,1495)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(8798-1495 \cdot 5 ,1495)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(1323,1495)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(1323,1495-1323)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(1323,172)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(1323-172 \cdot 7 ,172)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(119,172)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(119,172-119)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(119,53)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(119-53 \cdot 2,53)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(13,53).\\
\end{align*}At this point we can see that since $53$ is not divisible by the prime number $13$, the greatest common divisor is just $\boxed{1}$.
$567_{8} = 7\cdot8^{0}+6\cdot8^{1}+5\cdot8^{2} = 7+48+320 = \boxed{375}$.
Every even multiple of 5 has a units digit of 0 and every odd multiple of 5 has a units digit of 5
There are $100/5=20$ positive multiples of 5 less than or equal to 100
One half of them, $20/2=10$, are odd multiples of 5
Therefore, $\boxed{10}$ positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5.
We must minimize first the hundreds digit and then the tens digit to find the least three-digit whole number the product of whose digits is 6
The smallest possible hundreds digit is 1, and the least tens digit is 1 as well, giving a units digit of 6
Thus the least number is $\boxed{116}$.
We want to find the smallest four-digit number that is a multiple of lcm[2, 3, 5, 7] = 210, so we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $$ 210n \ge 1000
$$Dividing this inequality by 210 we get $n \ge 4\, \frac{16}{21}$, so $n = 5$ gives us the smallest four-digit multiple of 210: $210 \cdot 5 = \boxed{1050}$.
We can apply the Euclidean algorithm here.
\begin{align*}
\gcd(3n+4, n) &= \gcd(n, 3n+4 - 3n) \\
&= \gcd(n, 4).
\end{align*}There are three cases to consider:
Case 1: $n$ is odd
Therefore, $n$ and 4 are relatively prime and have a greatest common divisor of 1.
Case 2: $n$ is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4
In this case, $n$ and 4 share a common factor of 2
Since 4 has no other factors, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 2.
Case 3: $n$ is a multiple of 4
In this case, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 4.
Therefore, the three possible values for the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ are 1, 2, and 4
It follows that the sum of all possible value of the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ is $1+2+4 = \boxed{7}$.
Recall that $a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$
By the Euclidean Algorithm, we obtain: \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\left(\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\right) &= \text{gcd}(a^2-ab+b^2, ab) \\
&= \text{gcd}(a^2-2ab+b^2, ab) \\
&= \text{gcd}((a-b)^2, ab) \\
&= \text{gcd}(36, ab).
\end{align*}Thus, $\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$
Trying values of $b$,  we find that $b = 1 \Rightarrow a=7$ and $ab = 7\Rightarrow \text{gcd}(36, ab) = 1$
If $b = 2$, then $a=8$ and $ab=16 \Rightarrow \text{gcd}(36, ab) = 4$
Finally, $b = 3 \Rightarrow a=9$ and $ab=27 \Rightarrow \text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$
Therefore, the minimum possible value for $b$ is  $\boxed{3}$.
By the Binomial Theorem, \begin{align*}
(n - 2)^5 &= n^5 - \binom{5}{1} \cdot 2n^4 + \binom{5}{2} \cdot 2^2 n^3 - \binom{5}{3} \cdot 2^3 n^2 \\
&\qquad + \binom{5}{4} \cdot 2^4 n - 2^5 \\
&= n^5 - 10n^4 + 40n^3 - 80n^2 + 80n - 32.
\end{align*} Note that this reduces to $n^5 - 32 \equiv n^5 + 3 \pmod{5}$
Therefore, \begin{align*}
8(n - 2)^5 - n^2 + 14n - 24 &\equiv 8(n^5 + 3) - n^2 + 14n - 24 \\
&\equiv 8n^5 + 24 - n^2 + 14n - 24 \\
&\equiv 3n^5 - n^2 - n \pmod{5}.
\end{align*}
If $n \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$, then \[3n^5 - n^2 - n \equiv 3 \cdot 0^5 - 0^2 - 0 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}.\] If $n \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, then \[3n^5 - n^2 - n \equiv 3 \cdot 1^5 - 1^2 - 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}.\] If $n \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$, then \[3n^5 - n^2 - n \equiv 3 \cdot 2^5 - 2^2 - 2 \equiv 90 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}.\] If $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, then \[3n^5 - n^2 - n \equiv 3 \cdot 3^5 - 3^2 - 3 \equiv 717 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}.\] If $n \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$, then \[3n^5 - n^2 - n \equiv 3 \cdot 4^5 - 4^2 - 4 \equiv 3052 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}.\]
Therefore, the given expression is a multiple of 5 if and only if $n \equiv 0$ or $n \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$.
The largest value of $n$ less than 100000 that is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5 is $\boxed{99997}$.
Reading all congruences $\pmod{42}$, we have \begin{align*}
a-b &\equiv 18-73 \\
&\equiv -55 \\
&\equiv -55+42+42 \\
&\equiv 29\pmod{42}.
\end{align*}That's great, except we want to find $n$ with $100\leq n<142$
Therefore we should add copies of 42 until we get into this range: \[29\equiv 29+42\equiv71\pmod{42}.\]That's not large enough
\[71\equiv71+42\equiv113\pmod{42}.\]That is in our range, so $n=\boxed{113}$.
We use the Euclidean Algorithm
\begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,(3a^3+a^2+4a+57,a)
&=\text{gcd}\,(3a^3+a^2+4a+57-(3a^2+a+4)a,a)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(57,a).
\end{align*}Since $57$ is a divisor of $456$, and $a$ is a multiple of $456$, the greatest common divisor is $\boxed{57}$.
If $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by all of these numbers then $n-1$ is a multiple of all of these
We compute the LCM of these numbers as  \begin{align*}
\text{lcm}(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)&=\text{lcm}(5,6,7,8,9)\\
&=\text{lcm}(5,7,8,9)\\
&=5\cdot7\cdot8\cdot9\\
&=2520.
\end{align*} The smallest $n>1$ that satisfies $2520\mid n-1$ is $n=\boxed{2521}$.
Let $b$ be the base in which the numbers in the square are expressed
The first row and the first column must have the same sum, which implies that $1+11_b = 4+3$
Writing $11_b$ as $b+1$, we find that $1+b+1 = 7$, which implies $b=\boxed{5}$.
To find the smallest positive integer with exactly four factor pairs, we want the number to be divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 4
So the number is $1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4=\boxed{24}$.
Another way of writing the sequence $S$ is $\{7,7^7,7^{7^7},7^{7^{7^7}},\ldots\}$
We wish to determine the $100^{\text{th}}$ term of this sequence modulo $5$.
Note that $s_{100} = 7^{s_{99}}\equiv 2^{s_{99}}\pmod 5$
In order to determine the remainder of $2^{s_{99}}$ when divided by $5$, we look for a pattern in the powers of $2$ modulo $5$
Computing a few powers of $2$ yields \[\{2^0,2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4,\ldots\}\equiv \{1,2,4,3,1,\ldots\}\pmod 5.\]So we have a cyclic pattern $1,2,4,3$ of length $4$ (this is called a period)
Now we need to determine where $2^{s_{99}}$ falls in the cycle; to do that, we must determine the residue of $s_{99}\pmod 4$, since the cycle has length $4$.
Note that \begin{align*}
7&\equiv -1 \equiv 3 \pmod 4,\\
7^7&\equiv (-1)^7 \equiv -1 \equiv 3 \pmod 4,\\
7^{7^7}&\equiv (-1)^{7^7}\equiv -1 \equiv 3 \pmod 4,\\
&\vdots
\end{align*}Continuing in this manner, we always have $s_n \equiv 3\pmod 4$
Thus, $s_{100} = 2^{s_{99}} \equiv 2^3 \equiv \boxed{3}\pmod 5$.
If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$
The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes
Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$
By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$
If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$
We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$)
Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$
As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.
Adding $-13$ to both sides of $x + 13 \equiv 55 \pmod{34}$ gives $x \equiv 55-13 \pmod{34}$
We find $55-13 = 42 \equiv 8 \pmod{34}$, so $x \equiv 8 \pmod{34}$
Thus the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given congruence is $x = 8$, and all the other solutions can be obtained by a multiple of 34 to 8
The next three such integers are 42, 76, and 110
Since 110 is greater than 100, there are $\boxed{3}$ integers less than 100 that satisfy the congruence $x + 13 \equiv 55 \pmod{34}$.
We use the fact that a number which is divisible by three primes must be divisible by their product -- this comes from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Since we are looking for the least positive integer, we look at the three smallest primes: 2, 3, and 5
Multiplying these yields $2 \times 3 \times 5 = \boxed{30}$, which is the least positive integer divisible by three distinct primes.
If $x=.\overline{28}$, then $100x=28.\overline{28}$
Notice that we can eliminate the repeating decimal by subtracting $.\overline{28}$ from $28.\overline{28}$
We have $100x-x=99x=28$, so $x=\frac{28}{99}$
The repeating decimal can be expressed as the fraction $\boxed{\frac{28}{99}}$.
We have \begin{align*}
x &\equiv 4x - 3x \\
&\equiv 8-16 \\
&\equiv -8\quad\pmod{20}.
\end{align*}Therefore, $$x^2\equiv (-8)^2 = 64\equiv \boxed{4}\pmod{20}.$$
The prime factorization of 18 is $3^2\cdot2$, so in order for a number to be divisible by 18 it must be divisible by both 3 and 2
First, in order for a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3
In the case of $x15x$, this means that $x+1+5+x=2x+6$ must be divisible by 3
Since the constant term (6) is already a multiple of 3, $2x$ must be divisible by 3, which means that $x$ itself must be a multiple of $3$ as well
Second, in order for a number to be divisible by 2, the units digit must be an even number
In this case, the divisibility rule for 2 implies that $x$ must be an even number
Thus, since we know that it must be an even single-digit multiple of 3, the only possible value for $x$ is $\boxed{6}$.
An integer that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 can be written as $5n + 3$ for some whole number $n$
The largest permissible value of $n$ will lead us to the largest value of $5n + 3$ less than 80, so we solve the inequality
$$ 5n + 3 < 80
$$Subtracting 3 from both sides gives $5n < 77$
Dividing both sides by 5, we have $$ n < 15\, \frac{2}{5}, $$so the largest permissible value of $n$ is 15 and the largest integer less than 80 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 is $5 \cdot 15 + 3 = \boxed{78}$.
Rather than doing long division, we will write the given fraction to have a denominator of the form $10^b=2^b \cdot 5^b$, where $b$ is a positive integer
First, we write $\dfrac{3}{1250}$ as $\dfrac{3}{2^1 \cdot 5^4}$
To make the denominator fit the form $2^b \cdot 5^b$, we make $b$ the larger of the two exponents, which in this case is $4$
Thus, we have $$\frac{3}{5^4 \cdot 2^1} \cdot \frac{2^3}{2^3}=\frac{3 \cdot 2^3}{5^4 \cdot 2^4} = \frac{24}{10^4}$$The exponent in the denominator is $4$, and $24$ are the last two digits
Therefore, there are $4-2=\boxed{2}$ zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit.
Marcus has two equations: \[a=45n+37\]and \[b=30m+9.\]When he adds these he gets \[a+b=45n+30m+37+9=15(3n+2m)+46=15(3n+2m+3)+1.\]The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15 is $\boxed{1}$.
First, we need to find the largest possible value when sending a number with Option 2
If we had 10 1s the smallest binary number would be: $$1111111111_2=1023$$ This is greater than 1000, so the greatest possible cost when sending with option 2 will be 9
We can look at the largest numbers less than 1000 which cost 9 with Option 1 and see if they cost 9 with option 2
The largest numbers are: $$900,810,801,720,711,702,...$$ The smallest possible number with 10 digits and cost 9 in Option 2 is: $$1011111111_2=767$$ Below this, we would have: $$111111111_2=511$$ which doesn't work
We can quickly check the numbers above and see that they cost less than 9 with method 2
So, we now need to consider numbers with cost of 8
The largest numbers with a cost of 8 in Option 1 are: $$800,710,701,620,611,602,530,521,512,503,...$$ It is possible to check these in base 2 and see which is the first to cost 8 with Option 2, or we can go the other way and look at numbers with a cost of 8 in Option 2
Either way, we will find the largest possible integer with a cost of 8 is: $$111110111_2 = 503$$ We must check and make sure that there are no numbers larger than $503$ with an Option 2 cost lower than 8
The numbers with cost 7 in Option 1 with value greater than $503$ are $700$, $610$, $601$, and $520$
We can check that all cost less than 7 in Option 2 and can be eliminated
The numbers with cost 6 in Option 1 with value greater than $503$ are $600$ and $510$, neither of which have cost 6 in Option 2 and therefore do not work
Since a number with cost 5 or lower must be less than 500, the largest possible integer is $\boxed{503}$.
Since changing the base does not change the underlying quantity being represented, the sum of the base-4 representations of 195 and 61 is the same as the base-4 representation of 195+61
Recognizing that 195+61=256 is a power of 4, we put 1 in the place whose value is $4^4$ and 0 in the remaining places to obtain the sum $\boxed{10000}$.
After trying the first few steps, we notice that the boxes resemble the set of positive integers in quinary (base $5$)
In particular, the first box corresponds to the units digit, the second corresponds to the fives digit, and so forth
An empty box corresponds to the digit $0$ and a box with $k$ balls, $1 \le k \le 4$ corresponds to the digit $k$.
We need to verify that this is true
On the first step, the boxes represent the number $1$
For the $n$th step, suppose that the units digit of $n$ in quinary is not equal to $4$, so that the first box is not full
The operation of adding $1$ in quinary simply increments the units digit of $n$ by $1$
Indeed, Mady performs the corresponding operation by adding a ball to the first box
Otherwise, if the units digit of $n$ in quinary is equal to $4$, suppose that the rightmost $m$ consecutive quinary digits of $n$ are equal to $4$
Then, adding $1$ to $n$ entails carrying over multiple times, so that the $m+1$th digit will be incremented once and the other $m$ digits will become zero
Mady does the same: she places a ball in the first available box (the $m+1$th), and empties all of the previous boxes.
It follows that the number of filled boxes on the $2010$th step is just the sum of the digits in the quinary expression for $2010$
Converting this to quinary, the largest power of $5$ less than $2010$ is $5^{4} = 625$, and that $3 < 2010/625 < 4$
Then, $2010 - 3 \cdot 625 = 135$
Repeating this step, we find that $$2010 = 3 \cdot 5^{4} + 1 \cdot 5^3 + 2 \cdot 5^1,$$ so the desired answer is $3 + 1 + 2 = \boxed{6}$.
We use residues of the numbers of each type of coin to determine the number of dimes and quarters leftover: $$ \begin{array}{rcrcr} 83 + 129 &\equiv& 3 + 9 &\equiv& 12 \pmod{40} \\ 159 + 266 &\equiv& 9 + 16 &\equiv& 25 \pmod{50} \end{array} $$ The total value of the leftover quarters and dimes is $$ 12(\$0.25) + 25(\$0.10) = \$3.00 + \$2.50 = \boxed{\$5.50}
$343 = 7^3 = 1000_7$, so the first 343 natural numbers in base 7 are $1_7, 2_7, \ldots 1000_7$
Any number in this list that neither includes 4 or 5 only includes the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6
If we replace 6 with 4, these have the same decimal expansions as the integers in base 5
Since there are $5^3 = 125$ positive integers less than or equal to $1000_5$, there are 125 integers less than or equal to $1000_7$ that contain no 4's or 5's in base 7, which means there are $343 - 125 = \boxed{218}$ integers that include a 4 or a 5.
Since $12=2^2\cdot3$ and $15=3\cdot5$ are factors of $x$, $x$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of 12 and 15, which is $2^2\cdot3\cdot5$
Since $x$ has 12 factors and the LCM has $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12$ factors, $x=2^2\cdot3\cdot5=\boxed{60}$.
The units digit of a positive integer when expressed in base 6 is the same as the remainder when the integer is divided by 6
For example, the number $1502_6$ is equal to $1\cdot 6^3+5\cdot 6^2+0\cdot 6+2$, and 6 divides every term except the units digit, 2
When 217 is divided by 6, the remainder is 1
When 45 is divided by 6, the remainder is 3
Therefore, the product of 217 and 45 has a remainder of $1\cdot 3=\boxed{3}$ when divided by 6.
The greatest product of a 4-digit whole number and a 3-digit whole number is $(10^4-1)(10^3-1)=10^7-10^4-10^3+1=10^7-(10^4+10^3-1)$
$10^7$ has 8 digits and $10^4+10^3-1=11,000-1=10,999$ has 5 digits
Clearly, their difference (10,000,000-10,999) has $8-1=\boxed{7}$ digits.
We will try to prove that $f(n) = 2^n$
Given that $f(n) = k$, we know that $\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point
If we multiply $\frac{1}{k}$ by $10^n$, then all the digits are shifted $n$ places to the left, so we should end up with an integer that is not divisible by 10
Therefore, we want to find the smallest integer $k$ that divides $10^n$ and leaves a quotient that is not divisible by 10
If we let $k = 2^n$, then the quotient is $5^n$, which is odd and therefore not divisible by 10
For any integer smaller than $2^n$, the maximum power of 2 that can divide such an integer is $2^{n-1}$, so there remains at least one power of two that combines with a power of five to form an integer divisible by 10
Therefore, we have proved that $f(n) = 2^n$.
As a result, we can now conclude that $f(2010) = 2^{2010}$
The only integers that can divide $2^{2010}$ are $2^x$, for $0 \le x \le 2010$
There are $\boxed{2011}$ such integers.
First, we look for an integer which leaves remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5
Checking the remainders of 2, 7, 12, 17, $\ldots$ when divided by 4, we find that 17 is the least positive integer satisfying this condition
By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the only positive integers which leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 are those that differ from 17 by a multiple of $4\cdot 5=20$
Checking the remainders of 17, 37, $\ldots$ when divided by 7, we find that $17$ leaves a remainder of 3
Again, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers which satisfy all three conditions are those that differ from 17 by a multiple of $4\cdot5\cdot7=140$
Among the integers 17, 157, 297, $\ldots$, only $\boxed{157}$ is between 100 and 200.
We may carry out long division in base 4 just as in base 10
We have  \[
\begin{array}{cc|cccc}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & & 3 & 3 \\
\cline{3-6}
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 3 \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} && 3&3& \downarrow \\ \cline{4-5}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} && 0&3&3 \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} && & 3&3 \\ \cline{5-6}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} && & & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]for a quotient of $\boxed{33_4}$
Note that in the above calculation we have used that $11_4\cdot3_4=5_{10}\cdot3_{10}=15_{10}=33_4$
Then, for the second step we used $33_4$ divided by $11_4$ is $3_4$.
We rewrite $AB$ as $10A+B$ and $AAB$ as $100A+10A+B$
Now we set $AAB=9\cdot AB$ since $AB$ is $\frac{1}{9}$ of $AAB$
\begin{align*}
100A+10A+B&=9(10A+B)\quad\Rightarrow\\
&=90A+9B\quad\Rightarrow\\
20A&=8B\quad\Rightarrow\\
5A&=2B
\end{align*}The smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ such that $5A=2B$ are $A=2$ and $B=5$
So $AAB=\boxed{225}$.
$$ 6! = 720 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1
$$Using this prime factorization, we find the number of positive divisors of $6!$: $$ t(6!) = (4 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = \boxed{30}
We know that $\gcd(a,b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$
Hence, in this case, $ab = 180$
The prime factorization of 180 is $2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$, so $a = 2^p \cdot 3^q \cdot 5^r$ and $b = 2^s \cdot 3^t \cdot 5^u$ for some nonnegative integers $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$, $t$, and $u$
Then $ab = 2^{p + s} \cdot 3^{q + t} \cdot 5^{r + u}$
But $ab = 180 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$, so $p + s = 2$, $q + t = 2$, and $r + u = 1$.
We know that $\gcd(a,b) = 2^{\min\{p,s\}} \cdot 3^{\min\{q,t\}} \cdot 5^{\min\{r,u\}}$
The possible pairs $(p,s)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\min\{p,s\}$ are 0 and 1
The possible pairs $(q,t)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\min\{q,t\}$ are 0 and 1
The possible pairs $(r,u)$ are $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$, so the only possible value of $\min\{r,u\}$ is 0.
Therefore, the possible values of $\gcd(a,b)$ are $2^0 \cdot 3^0 = 1$, $2^1 \cdot 3^0 = 2$, $2^0 \cdot 3^1 = 3$, and $2^1 \cdot 3^1 = 6$, for a total of $\boxed{4}$ possible values.
Since $1_4+3_4+2_4=12_4$, we carry over the $1$
Then we have $1_4+1_4+2_4+3_4=13_4$, so we carry over another $1$
For the leftmost column, we have $1_4+1_4+3_4+1_4=12_4$
In column format, this reads $$ \begin{array}{c@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & _{1} &_{1}&\\ & & & 1& 1 & 1_4\\ & & & 3 & 2 & 3_4\\& & + & 1 & 3 & 2_4\\ \cline{2-6} & & 1 & 2 & 3& 2_4\\ \end{array} $$The sum is $\boxed{1232_4}$.
We can use the Division Theorem ($a=bq+r$)
$74 \div 7 = 10 R 4$, so $74 = 10 \times 7 + 4$
We subtract 1 to get a remainder of 3, so 74 - 1 = $\boxed{73}$ is the answer.
First we prime factorize $210=2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7$
Trying some pairwise products of these primes, we see that $210=(2\cdot7)(3\cdot5)=14\cdot15$
Also, $210=(5)(2\cdot3)(7)=5\cdot6\cdot7$
The sum of the five integers is $14+15+5+6+7=\boxed{47}$.
Reducing each number modulo 11 first, we get \[8735 + 8736 + 8737 + 8738 \equiv 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 \equiv \boxed{10} \pmod{11}.\]
If our number is $n$, then $n \equiv 2 \pmod 7$
This tells us that  \[3n - 7 = n + n + n - 7 \equiv 6 - 0 \pmod 7.\]The remainder is $\boxed{6}$ when the number is divided by $7.$
$432_{9} = 2\cdot9^{0}+3\cdot9^{1}+4\cdot9^{2} = 2+27+324 = \boxed{353}$.
We are asked to count the common multiples of $\{75,30,50\}$ among the positive integers less than or equal to $4000$
Since $75=3\cdot 5^2$, $30=2\cdot3\cdot 5$, and $50=2\cdot 5^2$, the least common multiple of the three numbers is $2\cdot 3 \cdot 5^2=150$
Since every common multiple is divisible by the least common multiple, we may count the multiples of $150$ less than $4000$
We divide $4000$ by $150$ and find a quotient of $\boxed{26}$.
The largest base-4 number that has four digits is $3333_4$, which is equal to $3 \cdot 4^3 + 3 \cdot 4^2 + 3 \cdot 4 + 3 = \boxed{255}$.
A multiple of 6 is a multiple of 3, which means the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3, and a multiple of 2, which means its units digit is even
We note that 4, 6, and 8 are even and that $3+4+6+8+9=30=3(10)$, so indeed it is possible to create a multiple of 6
Choose the smallest even number on the list, 4, for the units digit and arrange the rest of the digits in decreasing order to maximize the multiple of 6: $\boxed{98,634}$.
Since Jenny's new system of arranging stamps includes 10 on each page, the number of the last page will be the units digit of her total number of stamps (in base 10)
That units digit is the same as the units digit of $8 \cdot 2 \cdot 6 = 96$, which is $\boxed{6}$.
Between 1 and 25, the smallest prime number is 2 and the largest prime number is 23
Thus the sum is $2+23=\boxed{25}$.
First we note that $11=11^1<115<11^2=121$
Therefore, we know that $115_{10}$ will be a two digit number in base 11
The digit in the $11^1$ place will be $\text{A}$ because $10\cdot 11^1$ is the largest multiple of $11$ that is less than or equal to $115$, and in base 11, $\text{A}$ is used to represent $10$
The digit in the $11^0$ place will be $5$ because $115-110=5$
The final answer is $\boxed{\text{A5}_{11}}$.
Factoring out the highest power of 2 that divides 180, we get $180=2^2\cdot45$
Thus, the odd factors of 180 are all the factors of $45=3^2\cdot5^1$, which has $(2+1)(1+1)=\boxed{6}$ factors.
Consider the remainders of numbers in one of these sequences modulo 12
The first step doubles the remainder, but second step does not change it
So, if repeatedly doubling a number modulo 12 does not give $16 \equiv 4$, the number 16 cannot be a term in the sequence
On the other hand, if there is a term congruent to 4 mod 12 in the sequence, it must be 4, 16, or a number greater than 25
If it's 4, two steps later 16 will be in the sequence
If it's 16, then 16 is in the sequence
If it's greater than 25, then subtracting off 12 repeatedly will eventually give 16, the largest number less than 25 which is congruent to 4 modulo 12.
So, we just need to find which remainders modulo 12 will eventually give 4 when doubled modulo 12 repeatedly
We can easily see that 1, 2, 4, and 8 all give 4 modulo 12 eventually
We can also see that 3, 6, 9 and 0 will just end up at 0 (ie, multiples of 12) when doubled modulo 12, and so they will not reach 4 modulo 12
This leaves 5, 7, 10, and 11
Doubling 11 gives $22\equiv10$, $20\equiv8$, so 11 and 10 reach 4 modulo 12
Double 5 gives 10 modulo 12, and double 7 gives 2 modulo 12, so they will eventually reach 4.
Therefore, the only sweet numbers are congruent to 0, 3, 6, or 9 modulo 12, or in other words, multiples of 3
There are $\boxed{16}$ multiples of 3 between 1 and 50.
A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3
So a  four-digit number $ab23$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if the two-digit number $ab$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3
There are 90 two-digit numbers, of which $90/3 = \boxed{30}$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.
Note that the numbers whose decimal representations begin $0.00\ldots$ are the positive real numbers less than $1/100$
Therefore, the hundredths digit of $1/n$ is zero for all $n > 100$
Also, recall that $1/n$ is a terminating decimal if and only if $n$ is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5
The fifteen integers up to 100 whose prime factorizations contain only twos and fives are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 64, 80, and 100
One way to generate this list systematically is to consider integers of the form $2^m5^n$, starting with $n=0$ and $m=0,1,2,3,4,5,6$, then $n=1$ and $m=0,1,2,3,4$, etc
Not all of these 15 integers have nonzero hundredths digits, however
For $n\leq 10$, it is possible that the tenths digit is nonzero while the hundredths digit is zero
Checking the values of $n$ up to 10, we find that the hundredths digits of 1, 1/2, 1/5, and 1/10 are zero
Therefore, there are $15 - 4 = \boxed{11}$ fractions that yield terminating decimals with a nonzero digit two places to the right of the decimal point.
First, we simplify $1234 \pmod{7}$ to $1234 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$
Therefore, we have $$17n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$$This means that $17n$ can be written in the form $7a+2$, where $a$ is an integer
So we have $17n=7a+2$.
We want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\frac{7a+2}{17}=n$ is an integer
By trying values for $a$, we find that the smallest integer $a$ which satisfies the equation is $7$
Therefore, the least value for $n$ is $\frac{51}{17}=\boxed{3}$.
If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$
Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$
We also know that $N<60$
We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$
These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$
Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \boxed{71}$.
If we remember that $\frac19=.\overline{1}$, then we know that $.\overline{2}=\frac29$
The reciprocal is $\boxed{\frac92}$.
If we didn't know that $\frac19=.\overline{1}$, we let $x=.\overline{2}$
That means $10x=2.\overline{2}$ and $9x=2.\overline{2}-.\overline{2}=2$
So $x=\frac29$ and the reciprocal is $\frac92$.
Let the given base $7$ number be $n$
Suppose that $n$ has $d+1$ digits in either base $7$ or base $16$
Let $a_d$ be the leftmost digit of $n$ in its base $7$ expression, $a_{d-1}$ be the digit that is second from the left, and so forth, so that $a_0$ is the base $7$ units digit of $n$
It follows that $a_d$ is the base $16$ units digit of $n$, and so forth
Converting to base $10$, it follows that $$n = 7^d \cdot a_d + 7^{d-1} \cdot a_{d-1} + \cdots + a_0 = 16^d \cdot a_0 + 16^{d-1} \cdot a_1 + \cdots + a_d.$$Combining the like terms, it follows that $$(16^d - 1)a_0 + (16^{d-1} - 7)a_1 + \cdots + (1 - 7^d)a_d = 0.$$For $d \le 3$, we observe that the powers of $16$ are significantly larger than the powers of $7$
More precisely, since $a_i \le 6$ for each $i$, then we have the following loose bound from the geometric series formula
\begin{align*}
0 &= (16^d - 1)a_0 + (16^{d-1} - 7)a_1 + \cdots + (1 - 7^d)a_d \\
&\ge (16^d - 1) + (1 - 7) \cdot 6 + \cdots + (1-7^d) \cdot 6 \\
&= 16^d + d - 6 \cdot \frac{7^{d+1} - 1}{7 - 1} \\
&\ge 16^d - 7^{d+1} \\
\end{align*}For $d = 3$, then $16^3 = 4096 > 7^4 = 2401$, and by induction, $16^d > 7^{d+1}$ for all $d \ge 3$
Thus, $d \in \{0,1,2\}$
If $d = 0$, then all values will work, namely $n = 1,2,3,4,5,6$
If $d = 1$, then $$(16 - 1)a_0 + (1-7)a_1 = 15a_0 - 6a_1 = 3(5a_0 - 2a_1) = 0.$$Thus, $5a_0 = 2a_1$, so $5$ divides into $a_1$
As $a_1 \le 6$, then $a_1 = 0,5$, but the former yields that $n = 0$
Thus, we discard it, giving us the number $n = 52_7 = 5 \cdot 7 + 2 = 37$
For $d=2$, we obtain that $$(256 - 1)a_0 + (16 - 7)a_1 + (1 - 49)a_2 = 3(51a_0 + 3a_1 - 16a_2) = 0.$$Since $16a_2 \le 6 \cdot 16 = 96$, then $a_0 = 1$
Then, $51 + 3a_1 = 3(17 + a_1) = 16a_2$, so it follows that $a_2$ is divisible by $3$
Thus, $a_2 = 0,3,6$, but only $a_2 = 6$ is large enough
This yields that $a_1 = 15$, which is not possible in base $7$
Thus, the sum of the numbers satisfying the problem statement is equal to $1+2+3+4+5+6+37 = \boxed{58}.$
The year 3000 has a digit-sum of 3, so we look for possibilities before then
If the first digit is 2, then the remaining digits must be 0, 0, and 1
So the three years between 2000 and 3000 with a digit-sum of 3 are 2001, 2010, and 2100
Of these, only $\boxed{2100}$ is in the future.
Let the four-digit integer be $ab45$, where $a$ and $b$ denote digits
We may subtract 45 without changing whether the integer is divisible by 45, so let's consider $ab00$ instead of $ab45$
A number is divisible by $45$ if and only if it is divisible by both 9 and 5
Since the prime factorization of $ab00$ is the prime factorization of $ab$ times $2^2\cdot5^2$, $ab00$ is divisible by 45 if and only if $ab$ is divisible by $9$
The two-digit integers divisible by 9 are $9\cdot 2$, $9\cdot 3$, $\ldots$, and $9\cdot 11$
There are $11-2+1=\boxed{10}$ of them.
In order to get the greatest possible $q-r$, we want to maximize $q$ and minimize $r$
We divide 839 by 19 to find the maximum $q$
The quotient $q$ is 44 and the remainder $r$ is 3, and we can check that $839=19(44)+3$
So the greatest possible value of $q-r=44-3=\boxed{41}$.
It is much easier to find $120_4\div2_4$ and then multiply by $13_4$ than it is to do the calculations in the original order
For $120_4\div2_4$, we have  \[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 3 & 0 \\
\cline{2-4}
2 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{1} & 2 & \downarrow \\ \cline{2-3}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 0 & 0 \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 0 & 0 \\ \cline{3-4}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 0
\end{array}
\]for a quotient of $30_4$
Note that $12_4\div2_4=6_{10}\div2_{10}=3_{10}=3_4$
Now we find the product of $13_4$ and $30_4$
$$\begin{array}{@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& & & & \stackrel{2}{1} & 3_4& \\
& & & \times & & 3 & 0_4 \\
\cline{4-7} & & &1 &1 & 1 & 0_4 \\
\end{array}$$The answer is $\boxed{1110_4}$.
If an integer is congruent to 1 mod 3, then it can be written in the form $3k+1$
Therefore, we have two inequalities: $3k+1 \ge 10$, and $3k+1 \le 99$
The inequality $3k+1 \ge 10$ has solution $k\ge3$, and the inequality $3k+1 \le 99$ has solution $k \le 32 \frac{2}{3}$
Therefore, $k$ must be an integer between $3$ and $32$
There are $\boxed{30}$ such integers.
Let's consider a few small perfect cubes to see two less which is a perfect square: $2^3-2=6$, not a perfect square; $3^3-2=25=5^2$
Thus Jane is $27-1=\boxed{26}$ years old.
The units digit of any positive integer power of 5 is $\boxed{5}$.
(Note: this claim may be proved by induction, since the units digit of $5n$ is 5 whenever the units digit of $n$ is 5.)
We want a perfect square $a^2$ to be represented as $(b+1)^2-b^2$ for some nonnegative integer $b$
We can rewrite the difference of squares as $(b+1-b)(b+1+b)=1(2b+1)$
This means that we must be able to represent $a^2$ as $2b+1$ where $b$ is a nonnegative integer
But every positive odd integer can be represented in this form, so every odd perfect square from $1^2$ to $99^2$ satisfies this condition
Since there are 50 odd numbers from 1 to 99, there are $\boxed{50}$ such perfect squares.
Multiply numerator and denominator of 8/11 by 9 to get 72/99
The decimal form of 72/99 is $0.\overline{72}$, and it has a repeating block of length $\boxed{2}$.
Prime factorize $2004=2^2\cdot 3\cdot 167$
One of the summands $x$, $y$, or $z$ should be 167, for otherwise the summand which has 167 as a prime factor is at least $2\cdot 167$
The other two summands multiply to give 12, and the minimum sum of two positive integers that multiply to give 12 is $4+3=7$
Therefore, the minimum value of $x+y+z$ is $167+4+3=\boxed{174}$.
Since $x-3$ is a multiple of $7$, we know that $x\equiv 3\pmod 7$.
Since $y+3$ is a multiple of $7$, we know that $y\equiv -3\pmod 7$.
Therefore, \begin{align*}
x^2+xy+y^2+n &\equiv (3)^2 + (3)(-3) + (-3)^2 + n \\
&\equiv 9 - 9 + 9 + n \\
&\equiv 9 + n \qquad\pmod 7.
\end{align*}In other words, $9+n$ is a multiple of $7$
The smallest positive $n$ for which this is true is $n=\boxed{5}$.
We can rewrite $AA_5$ and $BB_7$ to get \begin{align*}
5A+A&=7B+B\quad\Rightarrow\\
6A&=8B\quad\Rightarrow\\
3A&=4B.
\end{align*}We can see that the smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ are $A=4$ and $B=3$
So the integer can be expressed as $44_5=33_7=\boxed{24_{10}}$.
We are looking for an integer $a$ such that $4a$ is congruent to 1 modulo 21
One approach is to check integers of the form $21k+1$, where $k\geq 0$ is an integer, for divisibility by 4
We find that 22 and 43 are not divisible by 4, but $21(3)+1=64$ is equal to $4\times 16$
Thus $\boxed{16}$ times 4 is congruent to 1 modulo 21.
We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$
Then we have \begin{align*}
a &\equiv 10\pmod{24}, \\
b &\equiv 4\pmod{24}, \\
c &\equiv 12\pmod{24}.
\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \begin{align*}
a+b+c &\equiv 10+4+12 \\
&= 26\pmod{24}.
\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$
This remainder is $\boxed{2}$.
We can use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of these two integers
\begin{align*}
\gcd(7979, 3713) &= \gcd(3713, 7979 - 2\cdot 3713) \\
&= \gcd(3713, 553) \\
&= \gcd(553, 3713 - 6\cdot 553) \\
&= \gcd(553, 395) \\
&= \gcd(395, 553 - 395) \\
&= \gcd(395, 158) \\
&= \gcd(158, 395- 2\cdot 158) \\
&= \gcd(158, 79) \\
&= \boxed{79}.
\end{align*}
For a number to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, it must satisfy two conditions:
it must divide exactly into $47 - 5$, or 42, and
it must be greater than 5, because the divisor is always greater than the remainder.
We list all divisors of 42 in pairs
They are 1 and 42, 2 and 21, 3 and 14, 6 and 7
Of these, only 42, 21, 14, 6, and 7 are greater than 5
There are $\boxed{5}$ different counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47.
Note that dividing 412 by 3 gives a quotient of 137 and a remainder of 1
Thus the next multiple of 3 is $3-1=\boxed{2}$ more than 412.
Let $S = 0.\overline{3}$
Then $10S = 3.\overline{3}$
Subtracting the second equation from the first we obtain $9S = 3$, so $S = \frac13$
The desired denominator is $\boxed{3}$.
We want to know the remainder when $17+33+65+83$ is divided by 8
The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \[17+33+65+83\equiv1+1+1+3\equiv6\pmod8.\]Therefore Winnie has $\boxed{6}$ balloons left over after giving out her balloons.
Checking the squares from $1^2$ to $10^2$, we see that no squares end in 2 or 3, while a square ends in 4 if its square root ends in 2 or 8
Since $31^2 < 1000 < 32^2$, we see that the squares less than 1000 ending in 4 are $2,8,12,18,22,28$
Thus the desired answer is $\boxed{6}$.
First notice that $5^n\equiv 2^n\pmod 3$, which should make our computations easier
For $n=1,2,3,4$, we get $2^n\equiv 2,1,2,1\pmod 3$ respectively and $n^5\equiv 1,2,0,1\pmod 3$ respectively
Since we have a congruent pair at $n=\boxed{4}$, we don't need to look any further.
Among five consecutive odd numbers, at least one is divisible by 3 and exactly one is divisible by 5, so the product is always divisible by 15
The cases $n=2$, $n=10$, and $n=12$ demonstrate that no larger common divisor is possible, since $\boxed{15}$ is the greatest common divisor of $3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot9\cdot11$, $11\cdot13\cdot15\cdot17\cdot19$, and $13\cdot15\cdot17\cdot19\cdot21$.
The largest perfect square less than $150$ is $12^2=144$
Therefore, there are $12$ perfect squares between $1$ and $150$.
The largest perfect cube less than $150$ is $5^3=125$
Therefore, there are $5$ perfect cubes between $1$ and $150$.
However, there are numbers between $1$ and $150$ that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes
For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it must be a 6th power
The largest sixth power less than $150$ is $2^6=64$
Therefore, there are $2$ sixth powers between $1$ and $150$
Those two numbers are counted twice, so we have to subtract $2$ from the number of numbers that are a perfect square or perfect cube.
Therefore, there are $12+5-2=15$ numbers that are either a perfect square or perfect cube
Therefore, there are $150-15= \boxed{135}$ numbers that are neither a perfect square or a perfect cube.
Let $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ and $\underline{d}\,\underline{e}$ be the two numbers
The product of the numbers is  \[
(100a+10b+c)(10d+e) = 1000ad + 100(ae+bd) + 10 (cd+be) + ce
\] Clearly $ad$ should be as large as possible, so $a$ and $d$ should be 9 and 7 or vice versa
Also, $c$ should be the smallest digit, since it only appears in the terms $10cd$ and $ce$
Trying $a=9$ and $d=7$, we have a product of  \[
63,\!000 + 100(9e+7b) + 10 (14+be) + 2e = 63,\!140+902e + 700b + 10be.
\] Since the coefficient of the $e$ term is larger than that of the $b$ term, $e=6$ and $b=4$ maximizes the product in this case
The maximum is $942\times 76=71,\!592$
If $a=7$ and $d=9$, then the sum is \[
63,\!000 + 100(7e+9b) + 10 (18+be) + 2e = 63,\!180+900b + 702e + 10be.
\] Since the coefficient of the $b$ term is larger than that of the $e$ term, $b=6$ and $e=4$ maximizes the product in this case
The maximum is $762\times 94=71,\!628$
Since $71,\!628>71,\!592$, the three-digit integer yielding the maximum product is $\boxed{762}$.
Let us represent a two-digit integer by $ab$, where $a$ is the tens digit and $b$ is the units digit
Then the value of the number is $10a+b$, the sum of the digits is $a+b$, and the product of the digits is $a\cdot b$
We are given that $a+b\mid 10a+b$ and $ab\mid 10a+b$
We know neither $a$ nor $b$ is zero since nothing is divisible by zero
We work with the equation $a+b\mid 10a+b$
We also know that $a+b\mid a+b$, so $a+b$ must divide the difference, which is $10a+b-a-b=9a$
So we have $a+b\mid 9a$, or $k(a+b)=9a$ for some integer $k$
Solving this equation gives $kb=(9-k)a$, or $\frac{b}{a}=\frac{9-k}{k}$
Since $a$ and $b$ are both positive, we must have $0<k\le9$, so the possible values of $\frac{b}{a}$ are $\frac{1}{8},\frac{2}{7},\frac{3}{6},\frac{4}{5},\frac{5}{4},\frac{6}{3},\frac{7}{2},\frac{8}{1}$
For each of these possibilities except $\frac{3}{6}$ and $\frac{6}{3}$, the fraction does not reduce, and thus the only values of $a$ and $b$ which will satisfy them are $a$ as the number in the denominator and $b$ as the number in the numerator
There is no pair of larger $(a,b)$ with the same ratio or else either $a$ or $b$ wouldn't be a single digit, and there is no pair of smaller $(a,b)$ since the fractions do not reduce
For these cases, we check to see whether $ab\mid 10a+b$:
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
$(a,b)$&$ab$&$10a+b$&Will it divide?\\ \hline
$(1,8)$&$8$&$18$&No\\
$(2,7)$&$14$&$27$&No\\
$(4,5)$&$20$&$45$&No\\
$(5,4)$&$20$&$54$&No\\
$(7,2)$&$14$&$72$&No\\
$(8,1)$&$8$&$81$&No
\end{tabular}
The only cases which remain are those for which $\frac{b}{a}=\frac{6}{3}=2$, or $\frac{b}{a}=\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$
So we have $b=2a$ or $a=2b$.
If $a=2b$, we must check whether $ab\mid 10a+b$
Substituting, we must find $b$ such that $2b^2\mid 10(2b)+b$, or $2b^2\mid 21b$
This means $21b=m(2b^2)$ for some integer $m$, or (since $b\neq 0$) $21=2mb$
But the right side is even and $21$ is odd, so there are no $b$ which satisfy this and thus no numbers with $a=2b$.
If $b=2a$, again we substitute to find $2a^2\mid 10a+2a$, or $2a^2\mid 12a$
This means $12a=n(2a^2)$ for some integer $n$, or $6=na$, so $a$ must be a divisor of $6$
Thus $a$ can be $1,2,3$, or $6$
The corresponding values of $b$ are $2,4,6$ and $12$
But $b\le 9$, so the pair $(6,12)$ must be thrown out and we have three possible pairs for $(a,b)$: $(1,2)$, $(2,4)$, and $(3,6)$
These correspond to the numbers $12, 24$, and $36$, and the sum is $12+24+36=\boxed{72}$.
Note that $0.8 = \frac{8}{10} = \frac{4}{5}$, so $\frac{4}{5} = \frac{y}{186+x}$
As $x$ is positive, we want to find the smallest number greater than $186$ which is a multiple of $5$
This number is 190, which implies $\boxed{x=4}$.
In order to find the product of the two, we first convert both values into base 10
We have that $1001_2=1(2^3)+0(2^2)+0(2^1)+1(2^0)=8+1=9$, and that $121_3=1(3^2)+2(3^1)+1(3^0)=9+6+1=16$
The product of the two is just $(9)(16)=\boxed{144}$.
First, we find that the prime factorization of $504$ is $2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7$
Note that the even divisors of 504 are precisely the integers of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ where $1\leq a \leq 3$, $0\leq b\leq 2$, and $0\leq c \leq 1$
Note also that distributing $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)$ yields 18 terms, with each integer of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ (again, where $1\leq a \leq 3$, $0\leq b\leq 2$, and $0\leq c \leq 1$) appearing exactly once
It follows that the sum of the even divisors of 504 is $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)=\boxed{1456}$.
The given information can be expressed by the congruences \begin{align*}n+5\equiv 0\pmod 8 \quad\implies\quad& n\equiv 3\pmod 8,\\n-8\equiv 0\pmod 5 \quad\implies\quad& n\equiv 3\pmod 5.\end{align*}Since $\gcd(5,8)=1$, the above congruences imply $n\equiv 3\pmod{40}$
This also implies the original congruences so $n$ is of the form $3+40m$ for an integer $m$
The first few positive integers of that form are $3,43,83,123$
Thus $\boxed{123}$ is the smallest such number with three digits.
We are looking at powers of 2, so we notice that $2^3=8=7+1$
Therefore  \[2^3\equiv1\pmod7.\] In particular \[2^{87}\equiv2^{3\cdot29}\equiv 8^{29}\equiv 1^{29}\equiv1\pmod7.\] Therefore \[2^{87}+3\equiv1+3\equiv4\pmod7.\] The remainder upon division by 7 is $\boxed{4}$.
If the two containers that held 11 eggs each held 12 eggs, then the number of eggs that you have would have been a multiple of 12
However, two eggs were removed, so the number of eggs you can have is two less than a multiple of 12
Therefore, the number of eggs you could have can be written in the form $12c-2$, where $c$ represents the number of containers you have
As a result, we would like to solve the inequality $12c-2 > 100$, which has solution $c > 8\frac{1}{2}$
Therefore, since the number of containers must be an integer, we must have $c=9$, so the smallest number of eggs you could have right now is $12(9) - 2 = \boxed{106}$.
We have $n = 50a-1$ for some integer $a$, so $n\equiv -1\pmod{50}$
Therefore, \begin{align*}
n^2+2n+3 &\equiv (-1)^2+2(-1)+3 \\
&\equiv 1-2+3 \\
&\equiv 2\quad\pmod{50}.
\end{align*}The remainder when $n^2+2n+3$ is divided by $50$ is $\boxed{2}$.
We notice that 16 divides $78+82$ as well as $79+81$ and also 80
Therefore the sum is congruent to  \[75+76+77\pmod{16}.\]Since these numbers are congruent to $-5$, $-4$, and $-3$ modulo 16, this can be computed as  \[-5-4-3\equiv-12\pmod{16}.\]Finally, since $-12\equiv4\pmod{16}$ the remainder we seek is $\boxed{4}$.
By the Euclidean Algorithm, \begin{align*}\text{gcd}\,(654321,543210) &= \text{gcd}\,(654321-543210,543210) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(111111,543210) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(5 \cdot 111111 - 543210, 111111) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(12345, 111111) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(12345, 12345 \cdot 10 - 111111) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(12345, 12339) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(12345-12339, 12339) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(6,12339)
\end{align*}We notice that $3 | 12339$ as $3 | 1+2+3+3+9 = 18$, but $12339$ is odd and thus not divisible by $6$
The answer is $\boxed{3}$.
Let the number of students in Teresa's class be $a$
Then \begin{align*}
a\equiv -1\equiv 2\pmod 3,\\
a\equiv -2\equiv 2\pmod 4,\\
a\equiv -3\equiv 2\pmod 5.
\end{align*} Since $\gcd(3,4)=\gcd(4,5)=\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $$a\equiv 2\pmod{3\cdot 4\cdot 5},$$ that is, $a\equiv 2\pmod{60}$
Since $a$ is then of the form $a=2+60n$, the only such number in the range $50<a<100$ is $\boxed{62}$.
We begin by converting all the numbers to base 10: \begin{align*} 165_7&=1(7^2)+6(7^1)+5(7^0)=49+42+5=96\\
11_2&=1(2^1)+1(2^0)=2+1=3\\
121_6&=1(6^2)+2(6^1)+1(6^0)=36+12+1=49\\
21_3&=2(3^1)+1(3^0)=6+1=7
\end{align*}Thus, the original expression becomes $\frac{96}{3}+\frac{49}{7}=32+7=\boxed{39}$.
Since exactly 1 in every $n$ consecutive dates is divisible by $n$, the month with the fewest relatively prime days is the month with the greatest number of distinct small prime divisors
This reasoning gives us June ($6=2\cdot3$) and December ($12=2^2\cdot3$)
December, however, has one more relatively prime day, namely December 31, than does June, which has only 30 days
Therefore, June has the fewest relatively prime days
To count how many relatively prime days June has, we must count the number of days that are divisible neither by 2 nor by 3
Out of its 30 days, $\frac{30}{2}=15$ are divisible by 2 and $\frac{30}{3}=10$ are divisible by 3
We are double counting the number of days that are divisible by 6, $\frac{30}{6}=5$ days
Thus, June has $30-(15+10-5)=30-20=\boxed{10}$ relatively prime days.
To convert to base 8, we realize $8^{5}>6543_{10}>8^{4}$
So, we can tell that $6543_{10}$ in base eight will have five digits
$8^{4}=4096$, which can go into 6543 only one time at most, leaving $6543-1\cdot4096 = 2447$ for the next four digits
$8^{3}=512$ goes into 2447 four times at most, leaving us with $2447-4\cdot512 = 399$
Then, $8^{2}=64$ goes into 399 six times at most, leaving $399-6\cdot64 = 15$
Next, we have $8^{1}=8$, which can go into 15 one time, leaving $15-1\cdot8 = 7$ for the ones digit
All together, the base eight equivalent of $6543_{10}$ is $14617_{8}$
We are looking for the product of the digits, which is $1\cdot4\cdot6\cdot1\cdot7 = \boxed{168}$.
We can use the distributive property of multiplication to multiply a three-digit palindrome $aba$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) with 101: $$ 101 \cdot aba = (100 + 1) \cdot aba = aba00 + aba = ab(2a)ba
$$Here, the digits of the product are $a$, $b$, $2a$, $b$, and $a$, unless carrying occurs
In fact, this product is a palindrome unless carrying occurs, and that could only happen when $2a \ge 10$
Since we want the smallest such palindrome in which carrying occurs, we want the smallest possible value of $a$ such that $2a \ge 10$ and the smallest possible value of $b$
This gives us $\boxed{505}$ as our answer and we see that $101 \cdot 505 = 51005$ is not a palindrome.
Since the units digits of $7 \cdot 17 \cdot 1977$ and $7^3$ are the same, their difference has a units digit of $\boxed{0}$.
Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$, $5n \equiv 5 \cdot 2 \equiv 10 \equiv \boxed{1} \pmod{3}$.
Since $t(n) = 11$ is prime and is the product of 1 more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$, there can be only one exponent, and therefore one prime in the prime factorization of $n$
This means $n = p^{10}$ for some odd prime number $p$, so $$ 8n^3 = 2^3 \cdot p^{30} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad t(8n^3) = (3 + 1)(30 + 1) = \boxed{124}
Start by adding the two numbers in base 10, we have $25_{10}+36_{10}=61_{10}$
Next, it is necessary to convert $61_{10}$ to base 3
The largest power of $3$ less than or equal to $61$ is $3^3=27$
The greatest multiple of this power that is less than $61$ is $2\cdot 3^3=54$, so the digit in the $3^3$ place is $2$
Now, we subtract $54$ from $61$ and get $7$
Since $3^2>7$, the digit in the $3^2$ place is $0$
We know that $3^1$ goes into $7$ twice without going over, so the digit in the $3^1$ place is $2$
Finally, $7-6=1$, so the digit in the $3^0$ place is $1$
Therefore, the value of $25_{10}+36_{10}$ in base 3 is $\boxed{2021_3}$.
Let us investigate the first few powers of 19: \begin{align*}
19^1 &\equiv 19 \pmod{25} \\
19^2 &\equiv 11 \pmod{25} \\
19^3 &\equiv 9 \pmod{25} \\
19^4 &\equiv 21 \pmod{25} \\
19^5 &\equiv 24 \pmod{25}.
\end{align*} At this point, we see that $19^5 \equiv 24 \equiv -1 \pmod{25},$ hence $19^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{25}.$ That means that $19^{1999} = 19^9 \cdot (19^{10})^{199} \equiv 19^9 \pmod {25}.$
Since $19^4 \equiv 21 \equiv -4 \pmod{25}$ and $19^5 \equiv -1 \pmod{25},$ then $19^{1999} \equiv 19^9 \equiv 4 \pmod{25},$ hence our desired remainder is $\boxed{4}.$
Divide the first congruence by 7, remembering to divide 14 by $\text{gcf}(7,14)=7$ as well
We find that the first congruence is equivalent to $x \equiv 1\pmod{2}$
Subtracting 13 from both sides and multiplying both sides by 5 (which is the modular inverse of 2, modulo 9) gives $x\equiv 6\pmod{9}$ for the second congruence
Finally, adding $2x$ to both sides in the third congruence and multiplying by 17 (which is the modular inverse of 3, modulo 25) gives $x\equiv 17\pmod{25}$
So we want to solve  \begin{align*}
x &\equiv 1 \pmod{2} \\
x &\equiv 6 \pmod{9} \\
x &\equiv 17 \pmod{25}
\end{align*}Let's first find a simultaneous solution for the second and third congruences
We begin checking numbers which are 17 more than a multiple of 25, and we quickly find that 42 is congruent to 17 (mod 25) and 6 (mod 9)
Since 42 does not satisfy the first congruence we look to the next solution $42+\text{lcm}(25,9)=267$
Now we have found a solution for the system, so we can appeal to the Chinese Remainder Theorem to conclude that the general solution of the system is $x\equiv 267 \pmod{450}$, where 450 is obtained by taking the least common multiple of 2, 9, and 25
So the least four-digit solution is $267 + 450 (2) = \boxed{1167}$.
The prime factorization of 180 is $2^2\cdot3^2\cdot5$
An integer is a divisor of $180$ if and only if each exponent in its prime factorization is less than or equal to the corresponding exponent in the prime factorization of 180
An integer is a perfect square if and only if every exponent in its prime factorization is even
Therefore, to form the prime factorization of a perfect square divisor of 180, we may take either 0 or 2 as the exponent of 2 and we may take either 0 or 2 as the exponent of 3
Therefore, there are $\boxed{4}$ perfect square divisors of 180: $2^0\cdot3^0$, $2^0\cdot3^2$, $2^2\cdot3^0$, and $2^2\cdot3^2$.
We are looking for the smallest base $b$ such that $100_b \le 62 < 1000_b$, which is the same as saying that $b^2 \le 62 < b^3$
The smallest perfect cube greater than 62 is 64, so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\sqrt[3]{64} = \boxed{4}$.
If we fix $b$ then increasing $n$ increases the number of factors, so we want $n$ to equal $15$
Recall that the number of prime factors of $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\cdots p_m^{e_m}$ equals $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\cdots (e_m+1)$, where the $p_i$ are primes
Thus we want the exponents in the prime factorization of $b$ to be as large as possible
Choosing $b=12=2^2\cdot 3$ gives $e_1=2,e_2=1$
Any other number less than or equal to $15$ will either be prime or will be the product of two primes, giving smaller exponents in the prime factorization
Thus $b=12$ is the best choice, and we have $b^n=2^{30}3^{15}$, which has $(30+1)(15+1)=\boxed{496}$ positive factors.
From the given information, the positive factors of $x$ include $1, 3,\frac{x}{3}$, and $x$
Therefore, we must have $1+3+\frac{x}{3}+x\le24$
Simplifying, we find $x\le15$
Testing $x=15$, we succeed: $1+3+5+15=24$
We try 3, 6, 9, and 12 to confirm that only 15 yields a sum of 24
Thus, $x=\boxed{15}$.
We see that the largest power of 5 that is less than 1357 is $5^4=625$, and the largest multiple of 625 less than 1357 is 1250, or $2\cdot625$
From here, we find that the largest power of five less than $1357-1250=107$ is $5^2=25$, and the largest multiple of 25 less than 107 is 100, or $4\cdot25$
Next, the largest power of five that is less than $107-100=7$ is $5^1=5$, simply giving us 5 or $1\cdot 5$ as the largest multiple of 5
Finally, this leaves us with $7-5=2$, or $2\cdot1=2\cdot5^0$
Therefore, we can express 1357 as $2\cdot5^4+0\cdot5^3+4\cdot5^2+1\cdot5^1+2\cdot5^0$, which gives us $\boxed{20412_5}$.
We start working from the rightmost column
Since $5>2$, $A_6+B_6+5_6$ is either equal to $12_6$ or $22_6$
Therefore, $A_6+B_6$ is either equal to $3_6$ or $13_6$.
We then look at the second rightmost digits
If $A_6+B_6=13_6$, then $2_6+B_6+1_6+1_6=5_6$
This means that $B_6=1$, which makes $A_6=12_6$
Since $A$ has to be a single-digit integer, this is impossible
Therefore, we try $A_6+B_6=3_6$
This gives us $1_6+B_6+1_6+1_6=5_6$, which means $B_6=2$, and $A_6=1_6$
We plug $B=2$ and $A=1$ into the equation to see if it works
$$ \begin{array}{c@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & &_{1}&\\ & & & 2& 2 & 1_6\\ & & & 4 & 1 & 2_6\\& & + & 1 & 1 & 5_6\\ \cline{2-6} & & 1 & 1 & 5& 2_6\\ \end{array} $$Therefore, the difference is $2_6 - 1_6 = \boxed{1_6}$.
We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$
Then we have \begin{align*}
a &\equiv 7\pmod{12}, \\
b &\equiv 9\pmod{12}, \\
c &\equiv 10\pmod{12}.
\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \begin{align*}
a+b+c &\equiv 7+9+10 \\
&= 26\pmod{12}.
\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $12$
This remainder is $\boxed{2}$.
We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$
Then we have \begin{align*}
a &\equiv 25\pmod{47}, \\
b &\equiv 20\pmod{47}, \\
c &\equiv 3\pmod{47}.
\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \begin{align*}
a+b+c &\equiv 25+20+3 \\
&= 48\pmod{47}.
\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $48$ upon division by $47$
This remainder is $\boxed{1}$.
Since $9 = 3^2$, we can convert directly to base 3 by expanding each base 9 digit into two base 3 digits:   \begin{align*} 8_9 &= 22_3 \\ 1_9 &= 01_3 \\ 3_9 &= 10_3 \end{align*}  Putting the base 3 digit pairs together, we get $813_9 = \boxed{220110_3}$.
To find the base $7$ representation of $777_{10}$, we first write $777$ as the sum of powers of $7$
To begin, we find that the largest power of $7$ that is less than $777$ is $7^3 = 343$
The largest multiple of $343$ that is less than $777$ is $2 \cdot 343 = 686$, so we have $777 = 2 \cdot 343 + 91$
We then consider the remainder $91$
The largest power of $7$ that is less than $91$ is $7^2 = 49$ and the largest multiple of $49$ that is less than $91$ is $1 \cdot 49 = 49$
This leaves us with $91 - 49 = 42$, which can be expressed as $6 \cdot 7^1$
Thus, we have $$777 = 2 \cdot 7^3 + 1 \cdot 7^2 + 6 \cdot 7^1 + 0 \cdot 7^0.$$Our base $7$ representation of $777_{10}$ is then $2160_7$
The sum of the digits of this number is $2 + 1 + 6 + 0 = \boxed{9}$.
The cycle has length $8$
So the numeric value of a letter is determined by its position within the alphabet, modulo $8$
So we determine the positions of all the letters in the word and use them to find the values:
n is the $14$th letter
$14\pmod 8=6$, so its value is $-2$.
u is the $21$st letter
$21\pmod 8=5$, so its value is $-1$.
m is the $13$th letter
$13\pmod 8=5$, so its value is $-1$.
e is the $5$th letter
$5\pmod 8=5$, so its value is $-1$.
r is the $18$th letter
$18\pmod 8=2$, so its value is $2$.
i is the $9$th letter
$9\pmod 8=1$, so its value is $1$.
c is the $3$rd letter
$3\pmod 8=3$, so its value is $1$.
The sum is $(-2)+(-1)+(-1)+(-1)+2+1+1=\boxed{-1}$.
We must check whether or not the difference between 40 and each of the prime numbers less than 20 (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19) is prime
We find that only $40-3=37$, $40-11=29$, and $40-17=23$ are prime
Thus, $\boxed{3}$ pairs of prime numbers have a sum of 40.
The largest power of $6$ that is less than or equal to $314$ is $6^3$, which equals $216$
Because $(1\cdot 6^3)=216<314<(2\cdot 6^3)=432$, the digit in the $6^3$ place is $1$
Since $314-216=98$, we know that the digit in the $6^2$ place is $2$ because $72=2\cdot 6^2<98<3\cdot 6^2=108$
We then note that $98-72=26$, which can be expressed as $(4\cdot6^1)+ (2\cdot 6^0)$
Therefore the digit in the $6^1$ places is $4$, and the digit in the $6^0$ place is $2$.
We now see that $314_{10}=\boxed{1242_6}$.
Let $n$ be the number of Dummies in one bag
Then we know $n\equiv 7\pmod 9$, so $$3n\equiv 3(7) = 21\equiv 3\pmod 9.$$Thus, when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, there is a remainder of $\boxed{3}$ leftover pieces.
We can also explain this solution without using modular arithmetic
Each bag can be divided equally among the $9$ kids with $7$ pieces from each bag left over
This makes $21$ leftover pieces, which are enough to give each kid $2$ more candies and have $3$ candies left over
Those last $3$ candies can't be divided equally among the kids, so the answer is $\boxed{3}$.
Let $f(n)$ be the sum of the digits of $n$
It turns out that $n-f(n)$ is always divisible by 9
As a proof, write $n = a_k10^k + a_{k-1}10^{k-1}+ \cdots + a_{1}10^1 + a_0$
Therefore, $n - f(n) = a_k(10^k - 1) + a_{k-1}(10^{k-1} - 1) + \cdots + a_2(10^2-1) + a_1(10-1)$
Note that, in general, $10^n - 1$ is divisible by 9 because $10^n-1$ is actually a string of $n$ 9's
Therefore, we can factor a 9 out of the right-hand side, so $n-f(n)$ is always divisible by 9
Note furthermore that $n-f(n)$ is always nonnegative, and that $f(n)$ and $n$ share the same remainder when divided by 9 (these are corollaries, the first coming from observation, the second being a direct result of the proof).
Now, consider $f(a_n)$, which is divisible by 9 if and only if $a_n$ is
We have $f(a_n) = f(1) + f(2) + \cdots + f(n-1) + f(n)$
Since $f(k)$ and $k$ have the same remainder when divided by 9, so we can substitute $k$ for $f(k)$ in each term without changing the remainder when divided by 9
Therefore, $f(a_k) \equiv \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \pmod 9$, which implies that we need either $k$ or $k+1$ to be divisible by 9
This happens either when $k$ is a multiple of 9 or when $k$ is one less than a multiple of 9
There are 11 multiples of 9 less than or equal to 100, and since 100 is not a multiple of 9, there are also 11 numbers which are one less than a multiple of 9 between 1 and 100
Therefore, there are $11 + 11 = \boxed{22}$ values of $a_k$ that are divisible by 9 for $1 \le k \le 100$.
Since $2^2 = 4$, we can convert directly to base 4 by pairing digits together starting from the right side of our base 2 integer:  \begin{align*} 01_2 &= 1_4
\\ 01_2 &= 1_4
\\ 10_2 &= 2_4
\\ 01_2 &= 1_4
\end{align*}  Putting the base 4 digits together, we get $1011001_2 = \boxed{1121_4}$.
Let $a$ be the inverse of $201$ modulo $299$
Then, by the definition of the inverse, $201\cdot a \equiv 1\pmod{299}$
We are looking for an integer $a$ that satisfies this congruence.
To make our task easier, we note that $603\equiv 5\pmod{299}$, and so \begin{align*}
603\cdot 60 &\equiv 5\cdot 60 \\
&= 300 \\
&\equiv 1\pmod{299}.
\end{align*}Now we write $603$ as $201\cdot 3$: $$201\cdot 3\cdot 60 \equiv 1\pmod{299}.$$Thus, the inverse we seek is $a = 3\cdot 60 = \boxed{180}$.
$150=2^13^15^2$
Thus the coefficient of $2$ must be between $1$ and $10$, the coefficient of $3$ must be between $1$ and $14$, and the coefficient of $5$ must be between $2$ and $8$
So the number of possible factors is
$$(10)(14)(7)=\boxed{980}$$
We want to find the units digit of the quotient \[\frac{2^{1993}+3^{1993}}5.\]We list the final two digits of  $2^n$ and $3^n$ in the next table
We also compute the units digit of the quotient whenever $2^n+3^n$ is divisible by $5.$

\end{tabular}We notice that after the first pair, the sequence repeats every $20.$ Therefore \[{2^{1993}+3^{1993}}\equiv {2^{13}+3^{13}}\equiv15\pmod{100}.\]So, the units digit of the quotient $\frac{2^{1993}+3^{1993}}5$ is $\boxed{3}.$
(Note: "mod 100" essentially means "remainder when the number is divided by 100"
So, $2^{1993} + 3^{1993} \equiv 15 \pmod{100}$ means that $2^{1993} + 3^{1993}$ is 15 more than a multiple of 100.)
Let $n$ be the number of dimes Natasha has
We know that $10<n<100$
The stacking data can be rephrased as  \begin{align*}
n&\equiv 1\pmod3\\
n&\equiv 1\pmod4\\
n&\equiv 1\pmod5.\\
\end{align*} Notice that any number $n$ such that $n\equiv 1\pmod{60}$ solves this system
(The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that 1 is the only residue class modulo 60 that solves all of these equivalences.)  Therefore $n=\boxed{61}$ is between 10 and 100 and solves this system.
For an integer to have only two positive divisors, it must be prime (the only positive divisors of a prime number are $1$ and itself)
Since $2$ is the smallest positive prime, $m=2$
For a positive integer to have exactly three positive divisors, it must be in the form $p^2$ where $p$ is prime (its only factors would be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$)
The largest $p^2$ less than $100$ is $7^2=49$
Thus, $n=49$ and $m+n=2+49=\boxed{51}$.
Since $2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$ and $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \equiv b^c \pmod{m}$ and $ad \equiv bd \pmod{m}$, $$2^{19}= (2^3)^6 \cdot 2^1 \equiv 1^6 \cdot 2 \equiv \boxed{2} \pmod{7}.$$
We can ignore the $0$ digit for now, and find the product of $24_7 \times 3_7$
First, we need to multiply the units digit: $4_7 \times 3_7 = 12_{10} = 15_7$
Hence, we write down a $5$ and carry-over the $1$
Evaluating the next digit, we need to multiply $2_7 \times 3_7 + 1_7 = 7_{10} = 10_{7}$
Thus, the next digit is a $0$ and $1$ is carried over
Writing this out:  $$\begin{array}{@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& & & & & \stackrel{1}{2} & \stackrel{}{4}_7 \\
& & & \times & & & 3_7 \\
\cline{4-7} & & & & 1 & 0 & 5_7 \\
\end{array}$$ We can ignore the $0$ in $30_7$, since it does not contribute to the sum
Thus, the answer is $1+0+5 = \boxed{6}$.
Notice that the base seven sum of the digits of a number leaves the same remainder upon division by $6$ as the number itself.
We see that $2^7=128$ is the largest power of 2 less than 222, leaving us with $222-128=94$
Since the next largest power of 2, $2^6=64$, is less than 94, we are left with the remainder $94-64=30$
Because $2^5=32$ is greater than 30, the next non-zero coefficient goes to the $2^4=16$ term, giving us a remainder of $30-16=14$
Continuing from here, we find that $222_{10}=1\cdot2^7+1\cdot2^6+0\cdot2^5+1\cdot2^4+1\cdot2^3+1\cdot2^2+1\cdot2^1+0\cdot2^0=11011110_2$
This gives us the sum $1+1+0+1+1+1+1+0=\boxed{6}$.
If one marathon equals $26$ miles and $385$ yards, then ten marathons equal $260$ miles and $3850$ yards
Those $3850$ yards can be broken down as $2$ miles and $3850 - (2\cdot 1760) = 3850 - 3520 = 330$ yards
Therefore, $y=\boxed{330}$.
A terminating decimal can be written in the form $\frac{a}{10^b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers
So we try to get a denominator of the form $10^b$: $$\frac{1}{2^5\cdot5^8}\cdot\frac{2^3}{2^3}=\frac{2^3}{10^8}=\frac{8}{10^8}.$$The fraction $\frac{8}{10^8}$ means that there are 8 digits to the right of the decimal point, the last of which is 8
So there are $\boxed{7}$ zeroes between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit.
We look for the remainder when $25,197,624$ is divided by $4$
We could manually divide to see that $4$ divides evenly into $25,197,624$ for a remainder of $0$, but the quicker way is to know the divisibility rule for $4$
If the last two digits of the number form a multiple of $4$, then the number itself is divisible by $4$
In this case, $24$ is a multiple of $4$, so $25,197,624$ is also a multiple of $4$
That means $\boxed{0}$ hot dogs will be left over.
Setting up the terms in a descending order, the first column gives you a residue of $3$ and you carry over $2$
In the second column there is no residue but you carry over $2$
Finally, in the third column, the sum of $7$ gives you a residue of $1$ and you carry over $1$
$$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}&_{1}&_{2}&_{2}&\\&&5&5&5_6\\&&&5&5_6\\&+&&&5_6\\ \cline{2-5} &1&1&0&3_6\\ \end{array}$$Thus, the answer is $\boxed{1103_6}$.
If a debt of $D$ dollars can be resolved in this way, then integers $p$ and $g$ must exist with \[
D = 300p + 210g = 30(10p + 7g).
\]As a consequence, $D$ must be a multiple of 30, and  no positive debt less than $\$30$ can be resolved
A debt of  $\boxed{\$30}$  can be resolved since \[
30 = 300(-2) + 210(3).
\]This is  done by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs.
$3206_7 = 3 \cdot 7^3 + 2 \cdot 7^2 + 0 \cdot 7^1 + 6 \cdot 7^0 = 1029 + 98 + 6 = \boxed{1133}$.
Dealing with the second condition, it is set up in the following manner
$$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\ &+&&C_6\\ \cline{2-4} &&C&0_6\\ \end{array}$$Because $B+C$ can not equal $0$, we must carry in this column
Therefore, we arrive at two equations
$B+C-6=0$ and $A+1=C$ Looking at the third condition: $$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\ &+&B&A_6\\ \cline{2-4} &&C&C_6\\ \end{array}$$We can determine that no carrying occurs
Therefore, $A+B=C$
We now have a system of equations for our three variables
\[B+C-6=0\]\[A+1=C\]\[A+B=C\]Subtracting the third equation from the second, $1-B=0$, or $B=1$
Plugging that into our first equation we can determine that $C=5$
$A$ must then equal $4$
Thus, $\overline{ABC}$ is $\boxed{415}$.
The five primes after 11 are 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29
The tenth prime number is $\boxed{29}$.
Recall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results
We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $5$ factors
Since 5 is prime, the only way for a positive integer to have 5 factors is for the only exponent in its prime factorization to be 4
The smallest fourth power of a prime number is $2^4=\boxed{16}$.
The units digit of $31^3$ is the same as the units digit of $1^3$, which is 1
The units digit of $13^3$ is the same as the units digit of $3^3$, which is 7
Therefore, the units digit of $31^3+13^3$ is $\boxed{8}$.
Factor out $7^3$ in the given expression $7^4-7^3=7^3(7-1)=7^3\cdot6=2\cdot3\cdot7^3$
Thus, the least prime factor of $7^4-7^3$ is $\boxed{2}$.
First, we find what the sum of the divisors of $400$ is.
The prime factorization of $400$ is $2^4 \cdot 5^2$
Therefore, the sum of the divisors is $(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4)(1+5+5^2) = 31 \cdot 31$
To see why the expression on the left-hand side gives the sum of the divisors of 400, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 15 terms, each divisor of $2^4\cdot 5^2$ appearing exactly once.
Since $31$ is a prime number, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ only has $\boxed{1}$ prime factor.
Note that $\gcd(a,b)$ divides both $a$ and $b$, so $\gcd(a,b)$ must also divide $a + b = 1001$
Clearly, $\gcd(a,b)$ cannot be equal to 1001 (because both $a$ and $b$ must be less than 1001)
The next-largest divisor of 1001 is 143
If $a = 143$ and $b = 1001 - 143 = 858$, then $\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(143,858) = 143$
Therefore, the largest possible value of $\gcd(a,b)$ is $\boxed{143}$.
$1011_2 + 101_2 - 1100_2 + 1101_2 = (1011_2 + 101_2) + (-1100_2 + 1101_2) = 10000_2 + 1_2 = \boxed{10001_2}$.
Reducing each number modulo 9 first, we get \begin{align*}
88134 + 88135 + 88136& + 88137 + 88138 + 88139\\
&\equiv 6 + 7 + 8 + 0 + 1 + 2 \\
&\equiv 24 \\
&\equiv \boxed{6} \pmod{9}.
\end{align*}
Let's find the prime factorization of 436,995: $436,995=3^4\cdot5395=3^4\cdot5\cdot1079=3^4\cdot5\cdot13\cdot83$
We see that $3^2\cdot83=747$ is a three-digit palindrome, and the product of the remaining powers of primes is a palindrome as well: $3^2\cdot5\cdot13=585$
Thus, the desired sum is $747+585=\boxed{1332}$.
Any positive integer divisor of $N$ must take the form $2^a \cdot 3^b \cdot 5^c$ where $0 \le a \le 3$, $0 \le b \le 2$ and $0 \le c \le 1$
In other words, there are 4 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$ and 2 choices for $c$
So there are $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = \boxed{24}$ natural-number factors of $N$.
$245_{8} = 5\cdot8^{0}+4\cdot8^{1}+2\cdot8^{2} = 5+32+128= \boxed{165}$.
Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$
When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$
Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$
Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\boxed{102}$ jellybeans.
When 200 is reached in the sequence of non-square positive integers, all the perfect squares from $1^2$ up to $14^2$ have been omitted
Therefore, 200 is the 186th term
The 187th term is 201, the 188th term is 202, $\ldots$, the 200th term is $\boxed{214}$.
The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 6 are \[4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, \ldots.\] The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 are \[3, 8, 13,
18, 23, 28, 33, \ldots.\] So 28 is the smallest possible number of coins that meets both conditions
Because $4 \times 7 = 28$, there are $\boxed{0}$ coins left when they are divided among seven people
\[ \text{OR} \] If there were two more coins in the box, the number of coins would be divisible by both 6 and 5
The smallest number that is divisible by 6 and 5 is 30, so the smallest possible number of coins in the box is 28, and our answer is $\boxed{0}.$
An integer that is equivalent to 6 mod 7 can be written in the form $7k+6$.
$1000$ is the smallest four-digit integer, so we want to solve the inequality $7k+6 \ge 1000$
This inequality has solution $k \ge 142$, so since $k$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $k$ is $142$
As a result, the smallest four-digit integer equivalent to 6 mod 7 is $7(142) + 6 = \boxed{1000}$.
Let $a$ be the desired number
The given system of congruences is \begin{align*}
a\equiv 1\pmod 3\\
a\equiv 1\pmod 4\\
a\equiv 2\pmod 5
\end{align*} Since $\gcd(3,4)=1$, $(1)$ and $(2)$ together imply that $a\equiv 1\pmod {12}$
So there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=1+12n$
Substituting this into $(3)$ yields $$1+12n\equiv 2\pmod 5,$$ $$\implies n\equiv 3\pmod 5.$$ So $n$ has a lower bound of $3$
Then $$n\ge 3,$$ $$\implies a=1+12n\ge 37.$$ Since $37$ satisfies all three congruences, $a=\boxed{37}$.
The binary number $b_k b_{k - 1} \dots b_2 b_1 b_0$ is equal to $2^k b_k + 2^{k - 1} b_{k - 1} + \dots + 4b_2 + 2b_1 + b_0$, so when this number is divided by 4, the remainder is $2b_1 + b_0$
Hence, when the number $100101110010_2$ is divided by 4, the remainder is $2 \cdot 1 + 0 = \boxed{2}$.
If $n$ is prime, then $f(n) = n+1$
If $n+1$ is prime, then $n$ must be even
Therefore, the only prime value of $n$ for which $n+1$ is prime is $n = 2$
If $n = p^a$ for some prime $p$ and an integer $a > 1$, then $f(n) = \frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}$
This value is not guaranteed to be composite, so we must check all powers of primes
Checking powers of $2$ first, $f(4) = 7$, $f(8) = 15$, and $f(16) = 31$
Two of these powers of 2 work
Checking powers of $3$, $f(9) = 13$ and $f(27)$ is beyond our boundary for $n$, so one power of $3$ works
Finally, $f(25) = 31$, which gives one more value of $n$ that works
Finally, if $n$ is any other composite integer, it can be written as the product of two distinct primes $p$ and $q$
Since $n \le 25$, $n$ cannot be the product of three distinct primes, so $n = p^aq^b$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$
As a result, $f(n) = \left(\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}\right)\left(\frac{q^{b+1}-1}{q-1}\right)$, but then $f(n)$ is the product of two integers which are greater than $1$, so $f(n)$ is composite
Therefore, there are $2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = \boxed{5}$ values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ is prime.
The given congruence has a solution if and only if $a$ is invertible modulo $12$ since the congruence implies that $a,x$ are inverses of each other modulo $12$
In other words, $\gcd(12,a)=1$
The only such positive $a$ less than $12$ are $1,5,7,11$
So the number of possible values of $a$ is $\boxed{4}$.
Since $\phi(49) = 42$ (see Euler's totient function), Euler's Totient Theorem tells us that $a^{42} \equiv 1 \pmod{49}$ where $\text{gcd}(a,49) = 1$
Thus $6^{83} + 8^{83} \equiv 6^{2(42)-1}+8^{2(42)-1}$ $\equiv 6^{-1} + 8^{-1} \equiv \frac{8+6}{48}$ $\equiv \frac{14}{-1}\equiv \boxed{35} \pmod{49}$.
Let Mary's score, number correct, and number wrong be $s,c,w$ respectively
$s=30+4c-w=30+4(c-1)-(w-4)=30+4(c+1)-(w+4)$.
Therefore, Mary could not have left at least five blank; otherwise, one more correct and four more wrong would produce the same score
Similarly, Mary could not have answered at least four wrong (clearly Mary answered at least one right to have a score above $80$, or even $30$.)
It follows that $c+w\geq 26$ and $w\leq 3$, so $c\geq 23$ and $s=30+4c-w\geq 30+4(23)-3=119$
So Mary scored at least $119$
To see that no result other than $23$ right/$3$ wrong produces $119$, note that $s=119\Rightarrow 4c-w=89$ so $w\equiv 3\pmod{4}$
But if $w=3$, then $c=23$, which was the result given; otherwise $w\geq 7$ and $c\geq 24$, but this implies at least $31$ questions, a contradiction
This makes the minimum score $\boxed{119}$.
Any multiple of 15 is a multiple of 5 and a multiple of 3.
Any multiple of 5 ends in 0 or 5; since $n$ only contains the digits 0 and 8, the units digit of $n$ must be 0.
The sum of the digits of any multiple of 3 must be divisible by 3
If $n$ has $a$ digits equal to 8, the sum of the digits of $n$ is $8a$
For this number to be divisible by 3, $a$ must be divisible by 3
We also know that $a>0$ since $n$ is positive
Thus $n$ must have at least three copies of the digit 8.
The smallest number which meets these two requirements is 8880
Thus the answer is $\frac{8880}{15} = \boxed{592}$.
If $(x,y)$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$, then we have $d_n=(a_n,a_{n+1})=(100+n^2,100+n^2+2n+1)$
Now assuming that $d_n$ divides $100+n^2$, it must divide $2n+1$ if it is going to divide the entire expression $100+n^2+2n+1$.
Thus the equation turns into $d_n=(100+n^2,2n+1)$
Now note that since $2n+1$ is odd for integral $n$, we can multiply the left integer, $100+n^2$, by a power of two without affecting the greatest common divisor
Since the $n^2$ term is quite restrictive, let's multiply by $4$ so that we can get a $(2n+1)^2$ in there.
So $d_n=(4n^2+400,2n+1)=((2n+1)^2-4n+399,2n+1)=(-4n+399,2n+1)$
It simplified the way we wanted it to! Now using similar techniques we can write $d_n=(-2(2n+1)+401,2n+1)=(401,2n+1)$
Thus $d_n$ must divide $\boxed{401}$ for every single $n$
This means the largest possible value for $d_n$ is $401$, and we see that it can be achieved when $n = 200$.
It follows from the givens that $a$ is a perfect fourth power, $b$ is a perfect fifth power, $c$ is a perfect square and $d$ is a perfect cube
Thus, there exist integers $s$ and $t$ such that $a = t^4$, $b = t^5$, $c = s^2$ and $d = s^3$
So $s^2 - t^4 = 19$
We can factor the left-hand side of this equation as a difference of two squares, $(s - t^2)(s + t^2) = 19$
19 is a prime number and $s + t^2 > s - t^2$ so we must have $s + t^2 = 19$ and $s - t^2 = 1$
Then $s = 10, t = 3$ and so $d = s^3 = 1000$, $b = t^5 = 243$ and $d-b=\boxed{757}$.
Let $m$ be the number $100a+10b+c$
Observe that $3194+m=222(a+b+c)$ so
\[m\equiv -3194\equiv -86\equiv 136\pmod{222}\]
This reduces $m$ to one of $136, 358, 580, 802$
But also $a+b+c=\frac{3194+m}{222}>\frac{3194}{222}>14$ so $a+b+c\geq 15$
Of the four options, only $m = \boxed{358}$ satisfies this inequality.
If $n+10 \mid n^3+100$, $\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)=n+10$
Using the Euclidean algorithm, we have $\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)= \gcd(-10n^2+100,n+10)$ $= \gcd(100n+100,n+10)$ $= \gcd(-900,n+10)$, so $n+10$ must divide $900$
The greatest integer $n$ for which $n+10$ divides $900$ is $\boxed{890}$; we can double-check manually and we find that indeed $900\mid 890^3+100$.
Rewrite all of the terms in base 3
Since the numbers are sums of distinct powers of 3, in base 3 each number is a sequence of 1s and 0s (if there is a 2, then it is no longer the sum of distinct powers of 3)
Therefore, we can recast this into base 2 (binary) in order to determine the 100th number
$100$ is equal to $64 + 32 + 4$, so in binary form we get $1100100$
However, we must change it back to base 10 for the answer, which is $3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2 = 729 + 243 + 9 = \boxed{981}$.
Let us write down one such sum, with $m$ terms and first term $n + 1$:
$3^{11} = (n + 1) + (n + 2) + \ldots + (n + m) = \frac{1}{2} m(2n + m + 1)$.
Thus $m(2n + m + 1) = 2 \cdot 3^{11}$ so $m$ is a divisor of $2\cdot 3^{11}$
However, because $n \geq 0$ we have $m^2 < m(m + 1) \leq 2\cdot 3^{11}$ so $m < \sqrt{2\cdot 3^{11}} < 3^6$
Thus, we are looking for large factors of $2\cdot 3^{11}$ which are less than $3^6$
The largest such factor is clearly $2\cdot 3^5 = 486$; for this value of $m$ we do indeed have the valid expression $3^{11} = 122 + 123 + \ldots + 607$, for which $k=\boxed{486}$.
We begin by multiplying the units digit: $8_9 \times 5_9 = 40_{10} = 44_9$
So, we write down a $4$ and carry-over another $4$
Moving on to the next digit, we need to evaluate $1_9 \times 5_9 + 4_9 = 9_{10} = 10_{9}$
Thus, the next digit is a $0$ and a $1$ is carried over
Finally, the leftmost digits are given by the operation $2_9 \times 5_9 + 1_9 = 11_{10} = 12_9$
Writing this out, we have  $$\begin{array}{@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& & & & \stackrel{1}{2} & \stackrel{4}{1} & \stackrel{}{8}_9 \\
& & & \times & & & 5_9 \\
\cline{4-7} & & & 1 & 2 & 0 & 4_9 \\
\end{array}$$So our final answer is $\boxed{1204_9}$.
In order to keep $m$ as small as possible, we need to make $n$ as small as possible.
$m = (n + r)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3$
Since $r < \frac{1}{1000}$ and $m - n^3 = r(3n^2 + 3nr + r^2)$ is an integer, we must have that $3n^2 + 3nr + r^2 \geq \frac{1}{r} > 1000$
This means that the smallest possible $n$ should be quite a bit smaller than 1000
In particular, $3nr + r^2$ should be less than 1, so $3n^2 > 999$ and $n > \sqrt{333}$
$18^2 = 324 < 333 < 361 = 19^2$, so we must have $n \geq 19$
Since we want to minimize $n$, we take $n = 19$
Then for any positive value of $r$, $3n^2 + 3nr + r^2 > 3\cdot 19^2 > 1000$, so it is possible for $r$ to be less than $\frac{1}{1000}$
However, we still have to make sure a sufficiently small $r$ exists.
In light of the equation $m - n^3 = r(3n^2 + 3nr + r^2)$, we need to choose $m - n^3$ as small as possible to ensure a small enough $r$
The smallest possible value for $m - n^3$ is 1, when $m = 19^3 + 1$
Then for this value of $m$, $r = \frac{1}{3n^2 + 3nr + r^2} < \frac{1}{1000}$, and we're set
The answer is $\boxed{19}$.
Let $p(n)$ denote the product of the distinct proper divisors of $n$
A number $n$ is nice in one of two instances:
It has exactly two distinct prime divisors.
If we let $n = pq$, where $p,q$ are the prime factors, then its proper divisors are $p$ and $q$, and $p(n) = p \cdot q = n$.
It is the cube of a prime number.
If we let $n=p^3$ with $p$ prime, then its proper divisors are $p$ and $p^2$, and $p(n) = p \cdot p^2 =n$.
We now show that the above are the only two cases
Suppose that another nice number existed that does not fall into one of these two categories
Then we can either express it in the form $n = pqr$ (with $p,q$ prime and $r > 1$) or $n = p^e$ (with $e \neq 3$)
In the former case, it suffices to note that $p(n) \ge (pr) \cdot (qr) = pqr^2 > pqr = n$.
In the latter case, then $p(n) = p \cdot p^2 \cdots p^{(e-1)} = p^{(e-1)e/2}$.
For $p(n) = n$, we need $p^{(e-1)e/2} = p^e \Longrightarrow e^2 - e = 2e \Longrightarrow$ $e = 0 or e = 3$.
Since $e \neq 3$, in the case $e = 0 \Longrightarrow n = 1$ does not work.
Thus, listing out the first ten numbers to fit this form, $2 \cdot 3 = 6,\ 2^3 = 8,\ 2 \cdot 5 = 10,$ $\ 2 \cdot 7 = 14,\ 3 \cdot 5 = 15,\ 3 \cdot 7 = 21,$ $\ 2 \cdot 11 = 22,\ 2 \cdot 13 = 26,$ $\ 3^3 = 27,\ 3 \cdot 11 = 33$
Summing these yields $\boxed{182}$.
If we move the $x^2$ term to the left side, it is factorable:
\[(3x^2 + 1)(y^2 - 10) = 517 - 10\]
$507$ is equal to $3 \cdot 13^2$
Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $3x^2 + 1$ cannot equal a multiple of three
$169$ doesn't work either, so $3x^2 + 1 = 13$, and $x^2 = 4$
This leaves $y^2 - 10 = 39$, so $y^2 = 49$
Thus, $3x^2 y^2 = 3 \times 4 \times 49 = \boxed{588}$.
It's clear that we must have $a = 2^j5^k$, $b = 2^m 5^n$ and $c = 2^p5^q$ for some nonnegative integers $j, k, m, n, p, q$
Dealing first with the powers of 2: from the given conditions, $\max(j, m) = 3$, $\max(m, p) = \max(p, j) = 4$
Thus we must have $p = 4$ and at least one of $m, j$ equal to 3
This gives 7 possible triples $(j, m, p)$: $(0, 3, 4), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4), (3, 3, 4), (3, 2, 4), (3, 1, 4)$ and $(3, 0, 4)$.
Now, for the powers of 5: we have $\max(k, n) = \max(n, q) = \max(q, k) = 3$
Thus, at least two of $k, n, q$ must be equal to 3, and the other can take any value between 0 and 3
This gives us a total of 10 possible triples: $(3, 3, 3)$ and three possibilities of each of the forms $(3, 3, n)$, $(3, n, 3)$ and $(n, 3, 3)$.
Since the exponents of 2 and 5 must satisfy these conditions independently, we have a total of $7 \cdot 10 = \boxed{70}$ possible valid triples.
Multiplying out all of the denominators, we get:
\begin{align*}104(n+k) &< 195n< 105(n+k)\\ 0 &< 91n - 104k < n + k\end{align*}
Since $91n - 104k < n + k$, $k > \frac{6}{7}n$
Also, $0 < 91n - 104k$, so $k < \frac{7n}{8}$
Thus, $48n < 56k < 49n$
$k$ is unique if it is within a maximum range of $112$, so $n = \boxed{112}$.
$n^3 \equiv 888 \pmod{1000} \implies n^3 \equiv 0 \pmod 8$ and $n^3 \equiv 13 \pmod{125}$
$n \equiv 2 \pmod 5$ due to the last digit of $n^3$
Let $n = 5a + 2$
By expanding, $125a^3 + 150a^2 + 60a + 8 \equiv 13 \pmod{125} \implies 5a^2 + 12a \equiv 1 \pmod{25}$.
By looking at the last digit again, we see $a \equiv 3 \pmod5$, so we let $a = 5a_1 + 3$ where $a_1 \in \mathbb{Z^+}$
Plugging this in to $5a^2 + 12a \equiv 1 \pmod{25}$ gives $10a_1 + 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{25}$
Obviously, $a_1 \equiv 2 \pmod 5$, so we let $a_1 = 5a_2 + 2$ where $a_2$ can be any non-negative integer.
Therefore, $n = 2 + 5(3+ 5(2+5a_2)) = 125a_2 + 67$
$n^3$ must also be a multiple of $8$, so $n$ must be even
$125a_2 + 67 \equiv 0 \pmod 2 \implies a_2 \equiv 1 \pmod 2$
Therefore, $a_2 = 2a_3 + 1$, where $a_3$ is any non-negative integer
The number $n$ has form $125(2a_3+1)+67 = 250a_3+192$
So the minimum $n = \boxed{192}$.
Note that $n$ is even, since the $LHS$ consists of two odd and two even numbers
By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know ${n^{5}}$ is congruent to $n$ modulo 5
Hence,
$3 + 0 + 4 + 2 \equiv n\pmod{5}$
$4 \equiv n\pmod{5}$
Continuing, we examine the equation modulo 3,
$1 - 1 + 0 + 0 \equiv n\pmod{3}$
$0 \equiv n\pmod{3}$
Thus, $n$ is divisible by three and leaves a remainder of four when divided by 5
It's obvious that $n>133$, so the only possibilities are $n = 144$ or $n \geq 174$
It quickly becomes apparent that 174 is much too large, so $n$ must be $\boxed{144}$.
Since $9^{4000}$ has 3816 digits more than $9^1$, $4000 - 3816 = \boxed{184}$ numbers have 9 as their leftmost digits.
The product of $n - 3$ consecutive integers can be written as $\frac{(n - 3 + a)!}{a!}$ for some integer $a$
Thus, $n! = \frac{(n - 3 + a)!}{a!}$, from which it becomes evident that $a \ge 3$
Since $(n - 3 + a)! > n!$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{n!(n+1)(n+2) \ldots (n-3+a)}{a!} = n! \Longrightarrow (n+1)(n+2) \ldots (n-3+a) = a!$
For $a = 4$, we get $n + 1 = 4!$ so $n = 23$
For greater values of $a$, we need to find the product of $a-3$ consecutive integers that equals $a!$
$n$ can be approximated as $^{a-3}\sqrt{a!}$, which decreases as $a$ increases
Thus, $n = \boxed{23}$ is the greatest possible value to satisfy the given conditions.
The prime factorization of $75 = 3^15^2 = (2+1)(4+1)(4+1)$
For $n$ to have exactly $75$ integral divisors, we need to have $n = p_1^{e_1-1}p_2^{e_2-1}\cdots$ such that $e_1e_2 \cdots = 75$
Since $75|n$, two of the prime factors must be $3$ and $5$
To minimize $n$, we can introduce a third prime factor, $2$
Also to minimize $n$, we want $5$, the greatest of all the factors, to be raised to the least power
Therefore, $n = 2^43^45^2$ and $\frac{n}{75} = \frac{2^43^45^2}{3 \cdot 5^2} = 16 \cdot 27 = \boxed{432}$.
$2^{12}\times5^8=2^4\times(2\times5)^8=16\times10^8$
$10^8$ has 9 digits, so $16\times(10)^8$ has 10 digits (1, 6, and eight 0's)
Therefore, there are $\boxed{10}$ digits in the value of $2^{12}\times5^8$.
Let the number of zeros at the end of $m!$ be $f(m)$
We have $f(m) = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{125} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{625} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{3125} \right\rfloor + \cdots$.
Note that if $m$ is a multiple of $5$, $f(m) = f(m+1) = f(m+2) = f(m+3) = f(m+4)$.
Since $f(m) \le \frac{m}{5} + \frac{m}{25} + \frac{m}{125} + \cdots  = \frac{m}{4}$, a value of $m$ such that $f(m) = 1991$ is greater than $7964$
Testing values greater than this yields $f(7975)=1991$.
There are $\frac{7975}{5} = 1595$ distinct positive integers, $f(m)$, less than $1992$
Thus, there are $1991-1595 = \boxed{396}$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.
We consider the method in which repeating decimals are normally converted to fractions with an example:
$x=0.\overline{176}$
$\Rightarrow 1000x=176.\overline{176}$
$\Rightarrow 999x=1000x-x=176$
$\Rightarrow x=\frac{176}{999}$
Thus, let $x=0.\overline{abc}$
$\Rightarrow 1000x=abc.\overline{abc}$
$\Rightarrow 999x=1000x-x=abc$
$\Rightarrow x=\frac{abc}{999}$
If $abc$ is not divisible by $3$ or $37$, then this is in lowest terms
Let us consider the other multiples: $333$ multiples of $3$, $27$ of $37$, and $9$ of $3$ and $37$, so $999-333-27+9 = 648$, which is the amount that are neither
The $12$ numbers that are multiples of $81$ reduce to multiples of $3$
We have to count these since it will reduce to a multiple of $3$ which we have removed from $999$, but, this cannot be removed since the numerator cannot cancel the $3$.There aren't any numbers which are multiples of $37^2$, so we can't get numerators which are multiples of $37$
Therefore $648 + 12 = \boxed{660}$.
Consider what carrying means: If carrying is needed to add two numbers with digits $abcd$ and $efgh$, then $h+d\ge 10$ or $c+g\ge 10$ or $b+f\ge 10$
Consider $c \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$
$1abc + 1ab(c+1)$ has no carry if $a, b \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$
This gives $5^3=125$ possible solutions.
With $c \in \{5, 6, 7, 8\}$, there obviously must be a carry
Consider $c = 9$
$a, b \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$ have no carry
This gives $5^2=25$ possible solutions
Considering $b = 9$, $a \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9\}$ have no carry
Thus, the solution is $125 + 25 + 6=\boxed{156}$.
Let our answer be $n$
Write $n = 42a + b$, where $a, b$ are positive integers and $0 \leq b < 42$
Then note that $b, b + 42, ..
, b + 42(a-1)$ are all primes.
If $b$ is $0\mod{5}$, then $b = 5$ because $5$ is the only prime divisible by $5$
We get $n = 215$ as our largest possibility in this case.
If $b$ is $1\mod{5}$, then $b + 2 \times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \leq 2$
Thus, $n \leq 3 \times 42 = 126 < 215$.
If $b$ is $2\mod{5}$, then $b + 4 \times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \leq 4$
Thus, $n \leq 5 \times 42 = 210 < 215$.
If $b$ is $3\mod{5}$, then $b + 1 \times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a = 1$
Thus, $n \leq 2 \times 42 = 84 < 215$.
If $b$ is $4\mod{5}$, then $b + 3 \times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \leq 3$
Thus, $n \leq 4 \times 42 = 168 < 215$.
Our answer is $\boxed{215}$.
Let $P'$ be the prism similar to $P$, and let the sides of $P'$ be of length $x,y,z$, such that $x \le y \le z$
\[\frac{x}{a} = \frac{y}{b} = \frac zc < 1.\]
Note that if the ratio of similarity was equal to $1$, we would have a prism with zero volume
As one face of $P'$ is a face of $P$, it follows that $P$ and $P'$ share at least two side lengths in common
Since $x < a, y < b, z < c$, it follows that the only possibility is $y=a,z=b=1995$
\[\frac{x}{a} = \frac{a}{1995} = \frac{1995}{c} \Longrightarrow ac = 1995^2 = 3^25^27^219^2.\]
The number of factors of $3^25^27^219^2$ is $(2+1)(2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 81$
Only in $\left\lfloor \frac {81}2 \right\rfloor = 40$ of these cases is $a < c$ (for $a=c$, we end with a prism of zero volume)
We can easily verify that these will yield nondegenerate prisms, so the answer is $\boxed{40}$.
We know that $n^2 = 2^{62}3^{38}$ must have $(62+1)\times (38+1)$ factors by its prime factorization
If we group all of these factors (excluding $n$) into pairs that multiply to $n^2$, then one factor per pair is less than $n$, and so there are $\frac{63\times 39-1}{2} = 1228$ factors of $n^2$ that are less than $n$
There are $32\times20-1 = 639$ factors of $n$, which clearly are less than $n$, but are still factors of $n$
Therefore, using complementary counting, there are $1228-639=\boxed{589}$ factors of $n^2$ that do not divide $n$.
Since $y|x$, $y+1|x+1$, then $\text{gcd}\,(y,x)=y$ (the bars indicate divisibility) and $\text{gcd}\,(y+1,x+1)=y+1$
By the Euclidean algorithm, these can be rewritten respectively as $\text{gcd}\,(y,x-y)=y$ and $\text{gcd}\, (y+1,x-y)=y+1$, which implies that both $y,y+1 | x-y$
Also, as $\text{gcd}\,(y,y+1) = 1$, it follows that $y(y+1)|x-y$
Thus, for a given value of $y$, we need the number of multiples of $y(y+1)$ from $0$ to $100-y$ (as $x \le 100$)
It follows that there are $\left\lfloor\frac{100-y}{y(y+1)} \right\rfloor$ satisfactory positive integers for all integers $y \le 100$
The answer is
\[\sum_{y=1}^{99} \left\lfloor\frac{100-y}{y(y+1)} \right\rfloor = 49 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = \boxed{85}.\]
Consider a point travelling across the internal diagonal, and let the internal diagonal have a length of $d$
The point enters a new unit cube in the $x,y,z$ dimensions at multiples of $\frac{d}{150}, \frac{d}{324}, \frac{d}{375}$ respectively
We proceed by using PIE.
The point enters a new cube in the $x$ dimension $150$ times, in the $y$ dimension $324$ times and in the $z$ dimension, $375$ times.
The point enters a new cube in the $x$ and $y$ dimensions whenever a multiple of $\frac{d}{150}$ equals a multiple of $\frac{d}{324}$
This occurs $\gcd(150, 324)$ times
Similarly, a point enters a new cube in the $y,z$ dimensions $\gcd(324, 375)$ times and a point enters a new cube in the $z,x$ dimensions $\gcd(375, 150)$ times.
The point enters a new cube in the $x,y$ and $z$ dimensions whenever some multiples of $\frac{d}{150}, \frac{d}{324}, \frac{d}{375}$ are equal
This occurs $\gcd(150, 324, 375)$ times.
The total number of unit cubes entered is then $150+324+375-[\gcd(150, 324)+\gcd(324, 375)+\gcd(375, 150))] + \gcd(150, 324, 375) = \boxed{768}$
To solve this question we need to think about what the units digit of a prime number could be
A two-digit prime could end in 1, 3, 7 or 9; thus, we need to examine primes only in the 10s, 30s, 70s and 90s because when the digits are switched the tens digit will become the units digit
The primes greater than 12 but less than 99 that are still prime when their two digits are interchanged are 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79 and 97
Their sum is $\boxed{418}$.
The harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ is equal to $\frac{1}{\frac{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}}2} = \frac{2xy}{x+y}$, so we have $xy=(x+y)(3^{20}\cdot2^{19})$, and by SFFT, $(x-3^{20}\cdot2^{19})(y-3^{20}\cdot2^{19})=3^{40}\cdot2^{38}$
Now, $3^{40}\cdot2^{38}$ has $41\cdot39=1599$ factors, one of which is the square root ($3^{20}2^{19}$)
Since $x<y$, the answer is half of the remaining number of factors, which is $\frac{1599-1}{2}= \boxed{799}$.
Notice that all odd numbers can be obtained by using $(a+1)^2-a^2=2a+1,$ where $a$ is a nonnegative integer
All multiples of $4$ can be obtained by using $(b+1)^2-(b-1)^2 = 4b$, where $b$ is a positive integer
Numbers congruent to $2 \pmod 4$ cannot be obtained because squares are $0, 1 \pmod 4.$ Thus, the answer is $500+250 = \boxed{750}.$
Let $x$ be the two-digit number, $y$ be the three-digit number
Putting together the given, we have $1000x+y=9xy \Longrightarrow 9xy-1000x-y=0$
Using SFFT, this factorizes to $(9x-1)\left(y-\dfrac{1000}{9}\right)=\dfrac{1000}{9}$, and $(9x-1)(9y-1000)=1000$.
Since $89 < 9x-1 < 890$, we can use trial and error on factors of 1000
If $9x - 1 = 100$, we get a non-integer
If $9x - 1 = 125$, we get $x=14$ and $y=112$, which satisifies the conditions
Hence the answer is $112 + 14 = \boxed{126}$.
The nearest fractions to $\frac 27$ with numerator $1$ are $\frac 13, \frac 14$; and with numerator $2$ are $\frac 26, \frac 28 = \frac 13, \frac 14$ anyway
For $\frac 27$ to be the best approximation for $r$, the decimal must be closer to $\frac 27 \approx .28571$ than to $\frac 13 \approx .33333$ or $\frac 14 \approx .25$.
Thus $r$ can range between $\frac{\frac 14 + \frac{2}{7}}{2} \approx .267857$ and $\frac{\frac 13 + \frac{2}{7}}{2} \approx .309523$
At $r = .2679, .3095$, it becomes closer to the other fractions, so $.2679 \le r \le .3095$ and the number of values of $r$ is $3095 - 2679 + 1 = \boxed{417}$.
It is evident that $k$ has only 2s and 3s in its prime factorization, or $k = 2^a3^b$.
$6^6 = 2^6\cdot3^6$
$8^8 = 2^{24}$
$12^{12} = 2^{24}\cdot3^{12}$
The LCM of any numbers an be found by writing out their factorizations and taking the greatest power for each factor
$[6^6,8^8] = 2^{24}3^6$
Therefore $12^{12} = 2^{24}\cdot3^{12} = [2^{24}3^6,2^a3^b] = 2^{\max(24,a)}3^{\max(6,b)}$, and $b = 12$
Since $0 \le a \le 24$, there are $\boxed{25}$ values of $k$.
If $n^2-19n+99=x^2$ for some positive integer $x$, then rearranging we get $n^2-19n+99-x^2=0$
Now from the quadratic formula,
$n=\frac{19\pm \sqrt{4x^2-35}}{2}$
Because $n$ is an integer, this means $4x^2-35=q^2$ for some nonnegative integer $q$
Rearranging gives $(2x+q)(2x-q)=35$
Thus $(2x+q, 2x-q)=(35, 1)$ or $(7,5)$, giving $x=3$ or $9$
This gives $n=1, 9, 10,$ or $18$, and the sum is $1+9+10+18=\boxed{38}$.
If we work with the problem for a little bit, we quickly see that there is no direct combinatorics way to calculate $m/n$
The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion still requires us to find the individual probability of each box.
Let $a, b$ represent the number of marbles in each box, and without loss of generality let $a>b$
Then, $a + b = 25$, and since the $ab$ may be reduced to form $50$ on the denominator of $\frac{27}{50}$, $50|ab$
It follows that $5|a,b$, so there are 2 pairs of $a$ and $b: (20,5),(15,10)$.
Case 1: Then the product of the number of black marbles in each box is $54$, so the only combination that works is $18$ black in first box, and $3$ black in second
Then, $P(\text{both white}) = \frac{2}{20} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{1}{25},$ so $m + n = 26$.
Case 2: The only combination that works is 9 black in both
Thus, $P(\text{both white}) = \frac{1}{10}\cdot \frac{6}{15} = \frac{1}{25}$
$m + n = 26$.
Thus, $m + n = \boxed{26}$.
\[(x-y)(x+y)=2000^2=2^8 \cdot 5^6\]
Note that $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$ have the same parities, so both must be even
We first give a factor of $2$ to both $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$
We have $2^6 \cdot 5^6$ left
Since there are $7 \cdot 7=49$ factors of $2^6 \cdot 5^6$, and since both $x$ and $y$ can be negative, this gives us $49\cdot2=\boxed{98}$ lattice points.
We use the fact that the number of divisors of a number $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)$
If a number has $18 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3$ factors, then it can have at most $3$ distinct primes in its factorization.
Dividing the greatest power of $2$ from $n$, we have an odd integer with six positive divisors, which indicates that it either is ($6 = 2 \cdot 3$) a prime raised to the $5$th power, or two primes, one of which is squared
The smallest example of the former is $3^5 = 243$, while the smallest example of the latter is $3^2 \cdot 5 = 45$.
Suppose we now divide all of the odd factors from $n$; then we require a power of $2$ with $\frac{18}{6} = 3$ factors, namely $2^{3-1} = 4$
Thus, our answer is $2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 = \boxed{180}$.
Let each point $P_i$ be in column $c_i$
The numberings for $P_i$ can now be defined as follows.\begin{align*}x_i &= (i - 1)N + c_i\\ y_i &= (c_i - 1)5 + i \end{align*}
We can now convert the five given equalities.\begin{align}x_1&=y_2 & \Longrightarrow & & c_1 &= 5 c_2-3\\ x_2&=y_1 & \Longrightarrow & & N+c_2 &= 5 c_1-4\\ x_3&=y_4 & \Longrightarrow & & 2 N+c_3 &= 5 c_4-1\\ x_4&=y_5 & \Longrightarrow & & 3 N+c_4 &= 5 c_5\\ x_5&=y_3 & \Longrightarrow & & 4 N+c_5 &= 5 c_3-2 \end{align}Equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ combine to form\[N = 24c_2 - 19\]Similarly equations $(3)$, $(4)$, and $(5)$ combine to form\[117N +51 = 124c_3\]Take this equation modulo 31\[24N+20\equiv 0 \pmod{31}\]And substitute for N\[24 \cdot 24 c_2 - 24 \cdot 19 +20\equiv 0 \pmod{31}\]\[18 c_2 \equiv 2 \pmod{31}\]
Thus the smallest $c_2$ might be is $7$ and by substitution $N = 24 \cdot 7 - 19 = 149$
The column values can also easily be found by substitution\begin{align*}c_1&=32\\ c_2&=7\\ c_3&=141\\ c_4&=88\\ c_5&=107 \end{align*}As these are all positive and less than $N$, $\boxed{149}$ is the solution.
We let $N_7 = \overline{a_na_{n-1}\cdots a_0}_7$; we are given that
\[2(a_na_{n-1}\cdots a_0)_7 = (a_na_{n-1}\cdots a_0)_{10}\](This is because the digits in $N$ ' s base 7 representation make a number with the same digits in base 10 when multiplied by 2)
Expanding, we find that
\[2 \cdot 7^n a_n + 2 \cdot 7^{n-1} a_{n-1} + \cdots + 2a_0 = 10^na_n + 10^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \cdots + a_0\]
or re-arranging,
\[a_0 + 4a_1 = 2a_2 + 314a_3 + \cdots + (10^n - 2 \cdot 7^n)a_n\]
Since the $a_i$s are base-$7$ digits, it follows that $a_i < 7$, and the LHS is less than or equal to $30$
Hence our number can have at most $3$ digits in base-$7$
Letting $a_2 = 6$, we find that $630_7 = \boxed{315}_{10}$ is our largest 7-10 double.
The prime factorization of $1001 = 7\times 11\times 13$
We have $7\times 11\times 13\times k = 10^j - 10^i = 10^i(10^{j - i} - 1)$
Since $\text{gcd}\,(10^i = 2^i \times 5^i, 7 \times 11 \times 13) = 1$, we require that $1001 = 10^3 + 1 | 10^{j-i} - 1$
From the factorization $10^6 - 1 = (10^3 + 1)(10^{3} - 1)$, we see that $j-i = 6$ works; also, $a-b | a^n - b^n$ implies that $10^{6} - 1 | 10^{6k} - 1$, and so any $\boxed{j-i \equiv 0 \pmod{6}}$ will work.
To show that no other possibilities work, suppose $j-i \equiv a \pmod{6},\ 1 \le a \le 5$, and let $j-i-a = 6k$
Then we can write $10^{j-i} - 1 = 10^{a} (10^{6k} - 1) + (10^{a} - 1)$, and we can easily verify that $10^6 - 1 \nmid 10^a - 1$ for $1 \le a \le 5$.
If $j - i = 6, j\leq 99$, then we can have solutions of $10^6 - 10^0, 10^7 - 10^1, \dots\implies 94$ ways
If $j - i = 12$, we can have the solutions of $10^{12} - 10^{0},\dots\implies 94 - 6 = 88$, and so forth
Therefore, the answer is $94 + 88 + 82 + \dots + 4\implies 16\left(\dfrac{98}{2}\right) = \boxed{784}$.
Let the sum of the integers in $\mathcal{S}$ be $N$, and let the size of $|\mathcal{S}|$ be $n+1$
After any element $x$ is removed, we are given that $n|N-x$, so $x\equiv N\pmod{n}$
Since $1\in\mathcal{S}$, $N\equiv1\pmod{n}$, and all elements are congruent to 1 mod $n$
Since they are positive integers, the largest element is at least $n^2+1$, the $(n+1)$th positive integer congruent to 1 mod $n$.
We are also given that this largest member is 2002, so $2002\equiv1\pmod{n}$, and $n|2001=3\cdot23\cdot29$
Also, we have $n^2+1\le2002$, so $n<45$
The largest factor of 2001 less than 45 is 29, so $n=29$ and $n+1$ $\Rightarrow{\boxed{30}}$ is the largest possible
This can be achieved with $\mathcal{S}=\{1,30,59,88,\ldots,813,2002\}$, for instance.
Note that it is impossible for any of $h,t,u$ to be $1$, since then each picket will have been painted one time, and then some will be painted more than once.
$h$ cannot be $2$, or that will result in painting the third picket twice
If $h=3$, then $t$ may not equal anything not divisible by $3$, and the same for $u$
Now for fourth and fifth pickets to be painted, $t$ and $u$ must be $3$ as well
This configuration works, so $333$ is paintable.
If $h$ is $4$, then $t$ must be even
The same for $u$, except that it can't be $2 \mod 4$
Thus $u$ is $0 \mod 4$ and $t$ is $2 \mod 4$
Since this is all $\mod 4$, $t$ must be $2$ and $u$ must be $4$, in order for $5,6$ to be paint-able
Thus $424$ is paintable.
$h$ cannot be greater than $5$, since if that were the case then the answer would be greater than $999$, which would be impossible for the AIME.
Thus the sum of all paintable numbers is $\boxed{757}$.
We express the numbers as $x=100a+10b+c$ and $y=100c+10b+a$
From this, we have\begin{eqnarray*}z&=&|100a+10b+c-100c-10b-a|\\&=&|99a-99c|\\&=&99|a-c|\\ \end{eqnarray*}Because $a$ and $c$ are digits, and $a$ and $c$ are both between 1 and 9 (from condition 1), there are $\boxed{9}$ possible values (since all digits except $9$ can be expressed this way).
$\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$ is a multiple of $200$ if $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is a multiple of $1200 = 2^4 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2$
So $16,3,25|k(k+1)(2k+1)$.
Since $2k+1$ is always odd, and only one of $k$ and $k+1$ is even, either $k, k+1 \equiv 0 \pmod{16}$.
Thus, $k \equiv 0, 15 \pmod{16}$.
If $k \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$, then $3|k$
If $k \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, then $3|2k+1$
If $k \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$, then $3|k+1$.
Thus, there are no restrictions on $k$ in $\pmod{3}$.
It is easy to see that only one of $k$, $k+1$, and $2k+1$ is divisible by $5$
So either $k, k+1, 2k+1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}$.
Thus, $k \equiv 0, 24, 12 \pmod{25}$.
From the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $k \equiv 0, 112, 224, 175, 287, 399 \pmod{400}$
Thus, the smallest positive integer $k$ is $\boxed{112}$.
To find the smallest value of $n$, we consider when the first three digits after the decimal point are $0.251\ldots$.
Otherwise, suppose the number is in the form of $\frac{m}{n} = 0.X251 \ldots$, where $X$ is a string of $k$ digits and $n$ is small as possible
Then $10^k \cdot \frac{m}{n} - X = \frac{10^k m - nX}{n} = 0.251 \ldots$
Since $10^k m - nX$ is an integer and $\frac{10^k m - nX}{n}$ is a fraction between $0$ and $1$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{10^k m - nX}{n} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $q \le n$
Then the fraction $\frac pq = 0.251 \ldots$ suffices.
Thus we have $\frac{m}{n} = 0.251\ldots$, or
$\frac{251}{1000} \le \frac{m}{n} < \frac{252}{1000} \Longleftrightarrow 251n \le 1000m < 252n \Longleftrightarrow n \le 250(4m-n) < 2n.$
As $4m > n$, we know that the minimum value of $4m - n$ is $1$; hence we need $250 < 2n \Longrightarrow 125 < n$
Since $4m - n = 1$, we need $n + 1$ to be divisible by $4$, and this first occurs when $n = \boxed{127}$.
Let the three integers be $a, b, c$
$N = abc = 6(a + b + c)$ and $c = a + b$
Then $N = ab(a + b) = 6(a + b + a + b) = 12(a + b)$
Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $ab = 12$ so $\{a, b\}$ is one of $\{1, 12\}, \{2, 6\}, \{3, 4\}$ so $a + b$ is one of $13, 8, 7$ so $N$ is one of $12\cdot 13 = 156, 12\cdot 8 = 96, 12\cdot 7 = 84$ so the answer is $156 + 96 + 84 = \boxed{336}$.
We want a number with no digits repeating, so we can only use the digits 0-9 once in constructing our number
To make the greatest number, we want the greatest digit to occupy the leftmost side and the least digit to occupy the rightmost side
Therefore, the last three digits of the greatest number should be an arrangement of the digits $0,1,2$
Since the number has to be divisible by 8, the integer formed by the arrangement of $0,1,2$ is also divisible by 8
The only arrangement that works is $120$.
Therefore, the remainder when the number is divided by $1000$ is $\boxed{120}$.
If $k$ is a positive even integer, then $$9^{k} = 81^{k/2}=\overbrace{(81)(81)\cdots (81)}^{k/2\text{ times}},$$so $9^k$ has a units digit of 1
Since 8 is even, $8^7$ is even
Therefore, $9^{8^7}$ has a units digit of $\boxed{1}$.
A brute-force solution to this question is fairly quick, but we'll try something slightly more clever: our numbers have the form ${\underline{(n+3)}}\,{\underline{(n+2)}}\,{\underline{( n+1)}}\,{\underline {(n)}}$$= 1000(n + 3) + 100(n + 2) + 10(n + 1) + n = 3210 + 1111n$, for $n \in \lbrace0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\rbrace$.
Now, note that $3\cdot 37 = 111$ so $30 \cdot 37 = 1110$, and $90 \cdot 37 = 3330$ so $87 \cdot 37 = 3219$
So the remainders are all congruent to $n - 9 \pmod{37}$
However, these numbers are negative for our choices of $n$, so in fact the remainders must equal $n + 28$.
Adding these numbers up, we get $(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) + 7\cdot28 = \boxed{217}$.
A positive integer $n$ has exactly two 1s in its binary representation exactly when $n = 2^j + 2^k$ for $j \neq k$ nonnegative integers
Thus, the set $S$ is equal to the set $\{n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid n = 2^j + 2^k \,\mathrm{ and }\, 0 \leq j < k \leq 39\}$
(The second condition ensures simultaneously that $j \neq k$ and that each such number less than $2^{40}$ is counted exactly once.) This means there are ${40 \choose 2} = 780$ total such numbers.
Now, consider the powers of $2$ mod $9$: $2^{6n} \equiv 1, 2^{6n + 1} \equiv 2, 2^{6n + 2} \equiv 4, 2^{6n + 3} \equiv 8 \equiv -1,$ $2^{6n + 4} \equiv 7 \equiv -2,$ $2^{6n + 5} \equiv 5 \equiv -4 \pmod 9$.
It's clear what the pairs $j, k$ can look like
If one is of the form $6n$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 3$ (7 choices)
If one is of the form $6n + 1$ (7 choices) the other must be of the form $6n + 4$ (6 choices)
And if one is of the form $6n + 2$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 5$ (6 choices)
This means that there are $7\cdot 7 + 7\cdot 6 + 7\cdot 6 = 49 + 42 +42 = 133$ total "good" numbers.
The probability is $\frac{133}{780}$, and the answer is $133 + 780 = \boxed{913}$.
Suppose we require $a$ $7$s, $b$ $77$s, and $c$ $777$s to sum up to $7000$ ($a,b,c \ge 0$)
Then $7a + 77b + 777c = 7000$, or dividing by $7$, $a + 11b + 111c = 1000$
Then the question is asking for the number of values of $n = a + 2b + 3c$.
Manipulating our equation, we have $a + 2b + 3c = n = 1000 - 9(b + 12c) \Longrightarrow 0 \le 9(b+12c) < 1000$
Thus the number of potential values of $n$ is the number of multiples of $9$ from $0$ to $1000$, or $112$.
However, we forgot to consider the condition that $a \ge 0$
For a solution set $(b,c): n=1000-9(b+12c)$, it is possible that $a = n-2b-3c < 0$ (for example, suppose we counted the solution set $(b,c) = (1,9) \Longrightarrow n = 19$, but substituting into our original equation we find that $a = -10$, so it is invalid)
In particular, this invalidates the values of $n$ for which their only expressions in terms of $(b,c)$ fall into the inequality $9b + 108c < 1000 < 11b + 111c$.
For $1000 - n = 9k \le 9(7 \cdot 12 + 11) = 855$, we can express $k$ in terms of $(b,c): n \equiv b \pmod{12}, 0 \le b \le 11$ and $c = \frac{n-b}{12} \le 7$ (in other words, we take the greatest possible value of $c$, and then "fill in" the remainder by incrementing $b$)
Then $11b + 111c \le 855 + 2b + 3c \le 855 + 2(11) + 3(7) = 898 < 1000$, so these values work.
Similarily, for $855 \le 9k \le 9(8 \cdot 12 + 10) = 954$, we can let $(b,c) = (k-8 \cdot 12,8)$, and the inequality $11b + 111c \le 954 + 2b + 3c \le 954 + 2(10) + 3(8) = 998 < 1000$
However, for $9k \ge 963 \Longrightarrow n \le 37$, we can no longer apply this approach.
So we now have to examine the numbers on an individual basis
For $9k = 972$, $(b,c) = (0,9)$ works
For $9k = 963, 981, 990, 999 \Longrightarrow n = 37, 19, 10, 1$, we find (using that respectively, $b = 11,9,10,11 + 12p$ for integers $p$) that their is no way to satisfy the inequality $11b + 111c < 1000$.
Thus, the answer is $112 - 4 = \boxed{108}$.
The $231$ cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes
Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension
If the original block has dimensions $l \times m \times n$, we must have $(l - 1)\times(m-1) \times(n - 1) = 231$
The prime factorization of $231 = 3\cdot7\cdot11$, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, $l - 1 = 1$ and $m - 1 = 11$ and $n - 1 = 3 \cdot 7$, among others
However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\cdot m\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \times 7 \times 11$
Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\times8\times12$, and $N= \boxed{384}$.
Denote the number of bananas the first monkey took from the pile as $b_1$, the second $b_2$, and the third $b_3$; the total is $b_1 + b_2 + b_3$
Thus, the first monkey got $\frac{3}{4}b_1 + \frac{3}{8}b_2 + \frac{11}{24}b_3$, the second monkey got $\frac{1}{8}b_1 + \frac{1}{4}b_2 + \frac{11}{24}b_3$, and the third monkey got $\frac{1}{8}b_1 + \frac{3}{8}b_2 + \frac{1}{12}b_3$.
Taking into account the ratio aspect, say that the third monkey took $x$ bananas in total
$x = \frac{1}{4}b_1 + \frac{1}{8}b_2 + \frac{11}{72}b_3 = \frac{1}{16}b_1 + \frac{1}{8}b_2 + \frac{11}{48}b_3 = \frac{1}{8}b_1 + \frac{3}{8}b_2 + \frac{1}{12}b_3$
Solve this to find that $\frac{b_1}{11} = \frac{b_2}{13} = \frac{b_3}{27}$
All three fractions must be integral
Also note some other conditions we have picked up in the course of the problem, namely that $b_1$ is divisible by $8$, $b_2$ is divisible by $8$, and $b_3$ is divisible by $72$ (however, since the denominator contains a $27$, the factors of $3$ cancel, and it only really needs to be divisible by $8$)
Thus, the minimal value is when each fraction is equal to $8$, and the solution is $8(11 + 13 + 27) = \boxed{408}$.
The prime factorization of 2004 is $2^2\cdot 3\cdot 167$
Thus the prime factorization of $2004^{2004}$ is $2^{4008}\cdot 3^{2004}\cdot 167^{2004}$.
We can count the number of divisors of a number by multiplying together one more than each of the exponents of the prime factors in its prime factorization
For example, the number of divisors of $2004=2^2\cdot 3^1\cdot 167^1$ is $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12$.
A positive integer divisor of $2004^{2004}$ will be of the form $2^a\cdot 3^b\cdot 167^c$
Thus we need to find how many $(a,b,c)$ satisfy
$(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)=2^2\cdot 3\cdot 167.$
We can think of this as partitioning the exponents to $a+1,$ $b+1,$ and $c+1$
So let's partition the 2's first
There are two 2's so this is equivalent to partitioning two items in three containers
We can do this in ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ ways
We can partition the 3 in three ways and likewise we can partition the 167 in three ways
So we have $6\cdot 3\cdot 3 = \boxed{54}$ as our answer.
It is well-known that $\tau(n)$ is odd if and only if $n$ is a perfect square
(Otherwise, we can group divisors into pairs whose product is $n$.) Thus, $S(n)$ is odd if and only if there are an odd number of perfect squares less than $n$
So $S(1), S(2)$ and $S(3)$ are odd, while $S(4), S(5), \ldots, S(8)$ are even, and $S(9), \ldots, S(15)$ are odd, and so on.
So, for a given $n$, if we choose the positive integer $m$ such that $m^2 \leq n < (m + 1)^2$ we see that $S(n)$ has the same parity as $m$.
It follows that the numbers between $1^2$ and $2^2$, between $3^2$ and $4^2$, and so on, all the way up to the numbers between $43^2$ and $44^2 = 1936$ have $S(n)$ odd
These are the only such numbers less than $2005$ (because $45^2 = 2025 > 2005$).
Notice that the difference between consecutive squares are consecutively increasing odd numbers
Thus, there are $3$ numbers between $1$ (inclusive) and $4$ (exclusive), $5$ numbers between $4$ and $9$, and so on
The number of numbers from $n^2$ to $(n + 1)^2$ is $(n + 1 - n)(n + 1 + n) = 2n + 1$
Whenever the lowest square beneath a number is odd, the parity will be odd, and the same for even
Thus, $a = [2(1) + 1] + [2(3) + 1] \ldots [2(43) + 1] = 3 + 7 + 11 \ldots 87$
$b = [2(2) + 1] + [2(4) + 1] \ldots [2(42) + 1] + 70 = 5 + 9 \ldots 85 + 70$, the $70$ accounting for the difference between $2005$ and $44^2 = 1936$, inclusive
Notice that if we align the two and subtract, we get that each difference is equal to $2$
Thus, the solution is $|a - b| = |b - a| = |2 \cdot 21 + 70 - 87| = \boxed{25}$.
If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$
If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$
Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \leq 14$
In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{294}$.
Given $g : x \mapsto \max_{j : 2^j | x} 2^j$, consider $S_n = g(2) + \cdots + g(2^n)$
Define $S = \{2, 4, \ldots, 2^n\}$
There are $2^0$ elements of $S$ that are divisible by $2^n$, $2^1 - 2^0 = 2^0$ elements of $S$ that are divisible by $2^{n-1}$ but not by $2^n, \ldots,$ and $2^{n-1}-2^{n-2} = 2^{n-2}$ elements of $S$ that are divisible by $2^1$ but not by $2^2$.
Thus\begin{align*} S_n &= 2^0\cdot2^n + 2^0\cdot2^{n-1} + 2^1\cdot2^{n-2} + \cdots + 2^{n-2}\cdot2^1\\ &= 2^n + (n-1)2^{n-1}\\ &= 2^{n-1}(n+1).\end{align*}Let $2^k$ be the highest power of $2$ that divides $n+1$
Thus by the above formula, the highest power of $2$ that divides $S_n$ is $2^{k+n-1}$
For $S_n$ to be a perfect square, $k+n-1$ must be even
If $k$ is odd, then $n+1$ is even, hence $k+n-1$ is odd, and $S_n$ cannot be a perfect square
Hence $k$ must be even
In particular, as $n<1000$, we have five choices for $k$, namely $k=0,2,4,6,8$.
If $k=0$, then $n+1$ is odd, so $k+n-1$ is odd, hence the largest power of $2$ dividing $S_n$ has an odd exponent, so $S_n$ is not a perfect square.
In the other cases, note that $k+n-1$ is even, so the highest power of $2$ dividing $S_n$ will be a perfect square
In particular, $S_n$ will be a perfect square if and only if $(n+1)/2^{k}$ is an odd perfect square.
If $k=2$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\frac{n+1}{4} \le 250$, so we have $n+1 = 4, 4 \cdot 3^2, \ldots, 4 \cdot 13^2, 4\cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2$.
If $k=4$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\frac{n+1}{16} \le 62$, so $n+1 = 16, 16 \cdot 3^2, 16 \cdot 5^2, 16 \cdot 7^2$.
If $k=6$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\frac{n+1}{64}\le 15$, so $n+1=64,64\cdot 3^2$.
If $k=8$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\frac{n+1}{256}\le 3$, so $n+1=256$.
Comparing the largest term in each case, we find that the maximum possible $n$ such that $S_n$ is a perfect square is $4\cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 - 1 = \boxed{899}$.
Because $24 = 3\cdot 2^3$, a square is divisible by 24 if and only if it is divisible by $3^2\cdot 2^4 = 144$
Furthermore, a perfect square $N^2$ less than $10^6$ is a multiple of 144 if and only if $N$ is a multiple of 12 less than $10^3$
Because 996 is the largest multiple of 12 less than $10^3$, there are $\frac{996}{12}= 83$ such positive integers less than $10^3$ and $\boxed{83}$ positive perfect squares which are multiples of 24.
A number in decimal notation ends in a zero for each power of ten which divides it
Thus, we need to count both the number of 5s and the number of 2s dividing into our given expression
Since there are clearly more 2s than 5s, it is sufficient to count the number of 5s.
One way to do this is as follows: $96$ of the numbers $1!,\ 2!,\ 3!,\ 100!$ have a factor of $5$
$91$ have a factor of $10$
$86$ have a factor of $15$
And so on
This gives us an initial count of $96 + 91 + 86 + \ldots + 1$
Summing this arithmetic series of $20$ terms, we get $970$
However, we have neglected some powers of $5$ - every $n!$ term for $n\geq25$ has an additional power of $5$ dividing it, for $76$ extra; every n! for $n\geq 50$ has one more in addition to that, for a total of $51$ extra; and similarly there are $26$ extra from those larger than $75$ and $1$ extra from $100$
Thus, our final total is $970 + 76 + 51 + 26 + 1 = 1124$, and the answer is $\boxed{124}$.
Numbers of the form $0.\overline{abc}$ can be written as $\frac{abc}{999}$
There are $10\times9\times8=720$ such numbers
Each digit will appear in each place value $\frac{720}{10}=72$ times, and the sum of the digits, 0 through 9, is 45
So the sum of all the numbers is $\frac{45\times72\times111}{999}= \boxed{360}$.
\[\log_8 a_1+\log_8 a_2+\ldots+\log_8 a_{12}= \log_8 a+\log_8 (ar)+\ldots+\log_8 (ar^{11}) \\ = \log_8(a\cdot ar\cdot ar^2\cdot \cdots \cdot ar^{11}) = \log_8  (a^{12}r^{66})\]
So our question is equivalent to solving $\log_8 (a^{12}r^{66})=2006$ for $a, r$ positive integers
$a^{12}r^{66}=8^{2006} = (2^3)^{2006} = (2^6)^{1003}$ so $a^{2}r^{11}=2^{1003}$.
The product of $a^2$ and $r^{11}$ is a power of 2
Since both numbers have to be integers, this means that $a$ and $r$ are themselves powers of 2
Now, let $a=2^x$ and $r=2^y$:
\begin{eqnarray*}(2^x)^2\cdot(2^y)^{11}&=&2^{1003}\\ 2^{2x}\cdot 2^{11y}&=&2^{1003}\\ 2x+11y&=&1003\\ y&=&\frac{1003-2x}{11} \end{eqnarray*}
For $y$ to be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by $11$
This occurs when $x=1$ because $1001=91*11$
Because only even integers are being subtracted from $1003$, the numerator never equals an even multiple of $11$
Therefore, the numerator takes on the value of every odd multiple of $11$ from $11$ to $1001$
Since the odd multiples are separated by a distance of $22$, the number of ordered pairs that work is $1 + \frac{1001-11}{22}=1 + \frac{990}{22}=46$
(We must add 1 because both endpoints are being included.) So the answer is $\boxed{46}$.
For the step above, you may also simply do $1001/11 + 1 = 91 + 1 = 92$ to find how many multiples of $11$ there are in between $11$ and $1001$
Then, divide $92/2$ = $\boxed{46}$ to find only the odd solutions.

Notice that $\angle{E} = \angle{BGC} = 120^\circ$ because $\angle{A} = 60^\circ$
Also, $\angle{GBC} = \angle{GAC} = \angle{FAE}$ because they both correspond to arc ${GC}$
So $\Delta{GBC} \sim \Delta{EAF}$.
\[[EAF] = \frac12 (AE)(EF)\sin \angle AEF  = \frac12\cdot11\cdot13\cdot\sin{120^\circ} = \frac {143\sqrt3}4.\]
Because the ratio of the area of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of the corresponding sides, $[GBC] = \frac {BC^2}{AF^2}\cdot[EAF] = \frac {12}{11^2 + 13^2 - 2\cdot11\cdot13\cdot\cos120^\circ}\cdot\frac {143\sqrt3}4 = \frac {429\sqrt3}{433}$
Therefore, the answer is $429+433+3=\boxed{865}$.
Let the first odd integer be $2n+1$, $n\geq 0$
Then the final odd integer is $2n+1 + 2(j-1) = 2(n+j) - 1$
The odd integers form an arithmetic sequence with sum $N = j\left(\frac{(2n+1) + (2(n+j)-1)}{2}\right) = j(2n+j)$
Thus, $j$ is a factor of $N$.
Since $n\geq 0$, it follows that $2n+j \geq j$ and $j\leq \sqrt{N}$.
Since there are exactly $5$ values of $j$ that satisfy the equation, there must be either $9$ or $10$ factors of $N$
This means $N=p_1^2p_2^2$ or $N=p_1p_2^4$
Unfortunately, we cannot simply observe prime factorizations of $N$ because the factor $(2n+j)$ does not cover all integers for any given value of $j$.
Instead we do some casework:
If $N$ is odd, then $j$ must also be odd
For every odd value of $j$, $2n+j$ is also odd, making this case valid for all odd $j$
Looking at the forms above and the bound of $1000$, $N$ must be
\[(3^2\cdot5^2),\ (3^2\cdot7^2),\ (3^4\cdot5),\ (3^4\cdot7),\ (3^4\cdot 11)\]
Those give $5$ possibilities for odd $N$.
If $N$ is even, then $j$ must also be even
Substituting $j=2k$, we get
\[N = 4k(n+k) \Longrightarrow \frac{N}{4} = k(n+k)\]
Now we can just look at all the prime factorizations since $(n+k)$ cover the integers for any $k$
Note that our upper bound is now $250$:
\[\frac{N}{4} = (2^2\cdot3^2),(2^2\cdot5^2),(2^2\cdot7^2), (3^2\cdot5^2), (2^4\cdot3), (2^4\cdot5), (2^4\cdot7), (2^4\cdot11), (2^4\cdot13), (3^4\cdot2)\]
Those give $10$ possibilities for even $N$.
The total number of integers $N$ is $5 + 10 = \boxed{15}$.
Let $K = \sum_{i=1}^{9}{\frac{1}{i}}$
Examining the terms in $S_1$, we see that $S_1 = K + 1$ since each digit $n$ appears once and 1 appears an extra time
Now consider writing out $S_2$
Each term of $K$ will appear 10 times in the units place and 10 times in the tens place (plus one extra 1 will appear), so $S_2 = 20K + 1$.
In general, we will have that
$S_n = (n10^{n-1})K + 1$
because each digit will appear $10^{n - 1}$ times in each place in the numbers $1, 2, \ldots, 10^{n} - 1$, and there are $n$ total places.
The denominator of $K$ is $D = 2^3\cdot 3^2\cdot 5\cdot 7$
For $S_n$ to be an integer, $n10^{n-1}$ must be divisible by $D$
Since $10^{n-1}$ only contains the factors $2$ and $5$ (but will contain enough of them when $n \geq 3$), we must choose $n$ to be divisible by $3^2\cdot 7$
Since we're looking for the smallest such $n$, the answer is $\boxed{63}$.
Note that the product of the first $100$ positive odd integers can be written as $1\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7\cdots 195\cdot 197\cdot 199=\frac{1\cdot 2\cdots200}{2\cdot4\cdots200} = \frac{200!}{2^{100}\cdot 100!}$
Hence, we seek the number of threes in $200!$ decreased by the number of threes in $100!.$
There are
$\left\lfloor \frac{200}{3}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{200}{9}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor \frac{200}{27}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{200}{81}\right\rfloor =66+22+7+2=97$
threes in $200!$ and
$\left\lfloor \frac{100}{3}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{100}{9}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor \frac{100}{27}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{100}{81}\right\rfloor=33+11+3+1=48$
threes in $100!$
Therefore, we have a total of $97-48=\boxed{49}$ threes.
Examine $F - 32$ modulo 9.
If $F - 32 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$, then we can define $9x = F - 32$
This shows that $F = \left[\frac{9}{5}\left[\frac{5}{9}(F-32)\right] + 32\right] \Longrightarrow F = \left[\frac{9}{5}(5x) + 32\right] \Longrightarrow F = 9x + 32$
This case works.
If $F - 32 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}$, then we can define $9x + 1 = F - 32$
This shows that $F = \left[\frac{9}{5}\left[\frac{5}{9}(F-32)\right] + 32\right] \Longrightarrow F = \left[\frac{9}{5}(5x + 1) + 32\right] \Longrightarrow$$F = \left[9x + \frac{9}{5}+ 32 \right] \Longrightarrow F = 9x + 34$
So this case doesn't work.
Generalizing this, we define that $9x + k = F - 32$
Thus, $F = \left[\frac{9}{5}\left[\frac{5}{9}(9x + k)\right] + 32\right] \Longrightarrow F = \left[\frac{9}{5}(5x + \left[\frac{5}{9}k\right]) + 32\right] \Longrightarrow F = \left[\frac{9}{5} \left[\frac{5}{9}k \right] \right] + 9x + 32$
We need to find all values $0 \le k \le 8$ that $\left[ \frac{9}{5} \left[ \frac{5}{9} k \right] \right] = k$
Testing every value of $k$ shows that $k = 0, 2, 4, 5, 7$, so $5$ of every $9$ values of $k$ work.
There are $\lfloor \frac{1000 - 32}{9} \rfloor = 107$ cycles of $9$, giving $5 \cdot 107 = 535$ numbers that work
Of the remaining $6$ numbers from $995$ onwards, $995,\ 997,\ 999,\ 1000$ work, giving us $535 + 4 = \boxed{539}$ as the solution.
Approach this problem systematically: 2 is prime, 2+3=5 is prime, 5+5=10 is composite, 10+7=17 is prime, 17+11=28 is composite, 28+13=41 is prime, 41+17=58 is composite, 58+19=77 is composite, 77+23=100 is composite, 100+29=129 is composite, 129+31=160 is composite, and finally 160+37=197 is prime
Thus, $\boxed{5}$ of the first 12 such sums are prime.
Let $n$ be the number of car lengths that separates each car
Then their speed is at most $15n$
Let a unit be the distance between the cars (front to front)
Then the length of each unit is $4(n + 1)$
To maximize, in a unit, the CAR comes first, THEN the empty space
So at time zero, the car is right at the eye.
Hence, we count the number of units that pass the eye in an hour: $\frac {15,000n\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{hour}}}{4(n + 1)\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{unit}}} = \frac {15,000n}{4(n + 1)}\frac{\text{units}}{\text{hour}}$
We wish to maximize this.
Observe that as $n$ gets larger, the $+ 1$ gets less and less significant, so we take the limit as $n$ approaches infinity
$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac {15,000n}{4(n + 1)} = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac {15,000}{4} = 3750$
Now, as the speeds are clearly finite, we can never actually reach $3750$ full UNITs
However, we only need to find the number of CARS
We can increase their speed so that the camera stops (one hour goes by) after the car part of the $3750$th unit has passed, but not all of the space behind it
Hence, $3750$ cars is possible, and the answer is $\boxed{375}$.
Let the biking rate be $b$, swimming rate be $s$, jogging rate be $j$, all in km/h.
We have $2b + 3j + 4s = 74,2j + 3s + 4b = 91$
Subtracting the second from twice the first gives $4j + 5s = 57$
Mod 4, we need $s\equiv1\pmod{4}$
Thus, $(j,s) = (13,1),(8,5),(3,9)$.
$(13,1)$ and $(3,9)$ give non-integral $b$, but $(8,5)$ gives $b = 15$
Thus, our answer is $15^{2} + 8^{2} + 5^{2} = \boxed{314}$.
Let the $k$th number in the $n$th row be $a(n,k)$
Writing out some numbers, we find that $a(n,k) = 2^{n-1}(n+2k-2)$.[1]
We wish to find all $(n,k)$ such that $67| a(n,k) = 2^{n-1} (n+2k-2)$
Since $2^{n-1}$ and $67$ are relatively prime, it follows that $67|n+2k-2$
Since every row has one less element than the previous row, $1 \le k \le 51-n$ (the first row has $50$ elements, the second $49$, and so forth; so $k$ can range from $1$ to $50$ in the first row, and so forth)
$n+2k-2 \le n + 2(51-n) - 2 = 100 - n \le 100,$
it follows that $67| n - 2k + 2$ implies that $n-2k+2 = 67$ itself.
Now, note that we need $n$ to be odd, and also that $n+2k-2 = 67 \le 100-n \Longrightarrow n \le 33$.
We can check that all rows with odd $n$ satisfying $1 \le n \le 33$ indeed contains one entry that is a multiple of $67$, and so the answer is $\frac{33+1}{2} = \boxed{17}$.
The difference between consecutive squares is $(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1$, which means that all squares above $50^2 = 2500$ are more than $100$ apart.
Then the first $26$ sets ($S_0,\cdots S_{25}$) each have at least one perfect square
Also, since $316^2 < 100000$ (which is when $i = 1000$), there are $316 - 50 = 266$ other sets after $S_{25}$ that have a perfect square.
There are $1000 - 266 - 26 = \boxed{708}$ sets without a perfect square.
Only the heights matter, and each crate is either 3, 4, or 6 feet tall with equal probability
We have the following:
\begin{align*}3a + 4b + 6c &= 41\\ a + b + c &= 10\end{align*}
Subtracting 3 times the second from the first gives $b + 3c = 11$, or $(b,c) = (2,3),(5,2),(8,1),(11,0)$
The last doesn't work, obviously
This gives the three solutions $(a,b,c) = (5,2,3),(3,5,2),(1,8,1)$
In terms of choosing which goes where, the first two solutions are analogous.
For $(5,2,3),(3,5,2)$, we see that there are $2\cdot\dfrac{10!}{5!2!3!} = 10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7$ ways to stack the crates
For $(1,8,1)$, there are $2\dbinom{10}{2} = 90$
Also, there are $3^{10}$ total ways to stack the crates to any height.
Thus, our probability is $\dfrac{10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7 + 90}{3^{10}} = \dfrac{10\cdot8\cdot7 + 10}{3^{8}} = \dfrac{570}{3^8} = \dfrac{190}{3^{7}}$
Our answer is the numerator, $\boxed{190}$.
Write $n^2 = (m + 1)^3 - m^3 = 3m^2 + 3m + 1$, or equivalently, $(2n + 1)(2n - 1) = 4n^2 - 1 = 12m^2 + 12m + 3 = 3(2m + 1)^2$.
Since $2n + 1$ and $2n - 1$ are both odd and their difference is $2$, they are relatively prime
But since their product is three times a square, one of them must be a square and the other three times a square
We cannot have $2n - 1$ be three times a square, for then $2n + 1$ would be a square congruent to $2$ modulo $3$, which is impossible.
Thus $2n - 1$ is a square, say $b^2$
But $2n + 79$ is also a square, say $a^2$
Then $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 = 80$
Since $a + b$ and $a - b$ have the same parity and their product is even, they are both even
To maximize $n$, it suffices to maximize $2b = (a + b) - (a - b)$ and check that this yields an integral value for $m$
This occurs when $a + b = 40$ and $a - b = 2$, that is, when $a = 21$ and $b = 19$
This yields $n = 181$ and $m = 104$, so the answer is $\boxed{181}$.
In base $3$, we find that $\overline{2008}_{10} = \overline{2202101}_{3}$
In other words,
$2008 = 2 \cdot 3^{6} + 2 \cdot 3^{5} + 2 \cdot 3^3 + 1 \cdot 3^2 + 1 \cdot 3^0$
In order to rewrite as a sum of perfect powers of $3$, we can use the fact that $2 \cdot 3^k = 3^{k+1} - 3^k$:
$2008 = (3^7 - 3^6) + (3^6-3^5) + (3^4 - 3^3) + 3^2 + 3^0 = 3^7 - 3^5 + 3^4 - 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^0$
The answer is $7+5+4+3+2+0 = \boxed{21}$.
Note: Solution by bounding is also possible, namely using the fact that $1+3+3^2 + \cdots + 3^{n} = \displaystyle\frac{3^{n+1}-1}{2}.$
Assume that the largest geometric number starts with a $9$
We know that the common ratio must be a rational of the form $k/3$ for some integer $k$, because a whole number should be attained for the 3rd term as well
When $k = 1$, the number is $931$
When $k = 2$, the number is $964$
When $k = 3$, we get $999$, but the integers must be distinct
By the same logic, the smallest geometric number is $124$
The largest geometric number is $964$ and the smallest is $124$
Thus the difference is $964 - 124 = \boxed{840}$.
We have that \[a\equiv (3^{2n}+4)^{-1}\equiv (9^{n}+4)^{-1}\equiv 4^{-1}\equiv \boxed{7}\pmod{9}.\]
First, note that $(2n)!! = 2^n \cdot n!$, and that $(2n)!! \cdot (2n-1)!! = (2n)!$.
We can now take the fraction $\dfrac{(2i-1)!!}{(2i)!!}$ and multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $(2i)!!$
We get that this fraction is equal to $\dfrac{(2i)!}{(2i)!!^2} = \dfrac{(2i)!}{2^{2i}(i!)^2}$.
Now we can recognize that $\dfrac{(2i)!}{(i!)^2}$ is simply ${2i \choose i}$, hence this fraction is $\dfrac{{2i\choose i}}{2^{2i}}$, and our sum turns into $S=\sum_{i=1}^{2009} \dfrac{{2i\choose i}}{2^{2i}}$.
Let $c = \sum_{i=1}^{2009} {2i\choose i} \cdot 2^{2\cdot 2009 - 2i}$
Obviously $c$ is an integer, and $S$ can be written as $\dfrac{c}{2^{2\cdot 2009}}$
Hence if $S$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, its denominator will be of the form $2^a$ for some $a\leq 2\cdot 2009$.
In other words, we just showed that $b=1$
To determine $a$, we need to determine the largest power of $2$ that divides $c$.
Let $p(i)$ be the largest $x$ such that $2^x$ that divides $i$.
We can now return to the observation that $(2i)! = (2i)!! \cdot (2i-1)!! = 2^i \cdot i! \cdot (2i-1)!!$
Together with the obvious fact that $(2i-1)!!$ is odd, we get that $p((2i)!)=p(i!)+i$.
It immediately follows that $p\left( {2i\choose i} \right) = p((2i)!) - 2p(i!) = i - p(i!)$, and hence $p\left( {2i\choose i} \cdot 2^{2\cdot 2009 - 2i} \right) = 2\cdot 2009 - i - p(i!)$.
Obviously, for $i\in\{1,2,\dots,2009\}$ the function $f(i)=2\cdot 2009 - i - p(i!)$ is is a strictly decreasing function
Therefore $p(c) = p\left( {2\cdot 2009\choose 2009} \right) = 2009 - p(2009!)$.
We can now compute $p(2009!) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \dfrac{2009}{2^k} \right\rfloor = 1004 + 502 + \cdots + 3 + 1 = 2001$
Hence $p(c)=2009-2001=8$.
And thus we have $a=2\cdot 2009 - p(c) = 4010$, and the answer is $\dfrac{ab}{10} = \dfrac{4010\cdot 1}{10} = \boxed{401}$.
If we choose $a_3$ and $a_1$ such that $(10^3)(a_3) + (10)(a_1) \leq 2010$ there is a unique choice of $a_2$ and $a_0$ that makes the equality hold
So $N$ is just the number of combinations of $a_3$ and $a_1$ we can pick
If $a_3 = 0$ or $a_3 = 1$ we can let $a_1$ be anything from $0$ to $99$
If $a_3 = 2$ then $a_1 = 0$ or $a_1 = 1$
Thus $N = 100 + 100 + 2 = \boxed{202}$.
We claim that $243$ is the minimal value of $m$
Let the two partitioned sets be $A$ and $B$; we will try to partition $3, 9, 27, 81,$ and $243$ such that the $ab=c$ condition is not satisfied
Without loss of generality, we place $3$ in $A$
Then $9$ must be placed in $B$, so $81$ must be placed in $A$, and $27$ must be placed in $B$
Then $243$ cannot be placed in any set, so we know $m$ is less than or equal to $243$.
For $m \le 242$, we can partition $S$ into $S \cap \{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 81, 82, 83, 84 ..
242\}$ and $S \cap \{9, 10, 11 ..
80\}$, and in neither set are there values where $ab=c$ (since $8 < (3\text{ to }8)^2 < 81$ and $(9\text{ to }80)^2 > 80$)
Thus $m = \boxed{243}$.
Note that $x \equiv y \pmod{1000} \Leftrightarrow x \equiv y \pmod{125}$ and $x \equiv y \pmod{8}$
So we must find the first two integers $i$ and $j$ such that $2^i \equiv 2^j \pmod{125}$ and $2^i \equiv 2^j \pmod{8}$ and $i \neq j$
Note that $i$ and $j$ will be greater than 2 since remainders of $1, 2, 4$ will not be possible after 2 (the numbers following will always be congruent to 0 modulo 8)
Note that $2^{100}\equiv 1\pmod{125}$ (see Euler's theorem) and $2^0,2^1,2^2,\ldots,2^{99}$ are all distinct modulo 125 (proof below)
Thus, $i = 103$ and $j =3$ are the first two integers such that $2^i \equiv 2^j \pmod{1000}$
All that is left is to find $S$ in mod $1000$
After some computation:\[S = 2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+...+2^{101}+ 2^{102} = 2^{103}-1 \equiv 8 - 1 \mod 1000 = \boxed{7}.\]To show that $2^0, 2^1,\ldots, 2^{99}$ are distinct modulo 125, suppose for the sake of contradiction that they are not
Then, we must have at least one of $2^{20}\equiv 1\pmod{125}$ or $2^{50}\equiv 1\pmod{125}$
However, writing $2^{10}\equiv 25 - 1\pmod{125}$, we can easily verify that $2^{20}\equiv -49\pmod{125}$ and $2^{50}\equiv -1\pmod{125}$, giving us the needed contradiction.
We see that a number $n$ is $p$-safe if and only if the residue of $n \mod p$ is greater than $2$ and less than $p-2$; thus, there are $p-5$ residues $\mod p$ that a $p$-safe number can have
Therefore, a number $n$ satisfying the conditions of the problem can have $2$ different residues $\mod 7$, $6$ different residues $\mod 11$, and $8$ different residues $\mod 13$
The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that for a number $x$ that is $a$ (mod b) $c$ (mod d) $e$ (mod f) has one solution if $gcd(b,d,f)=1$
For example, in our case, the number $n$ can be: 3 (mod 7) 3 (mod 11) 7 (mod 13) so since $gcd(7,11,13)$=1, there is 1 solution for n for this case of residues of $n$.
This means that by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $n$ can have $2\cdot 6 \cdot 8 = 96$ different residues mod $7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 = 1001$
Thus, there are $960$ values of $n$ satisfying the conditions in the range $0 \le n < 10010$
However, we must now remove any values greater than $10000$ that satisfy the conditions
By checking residues, we easily see that the only such values are $10006$ and $10007$, so there remain $\boxed{958}$ values satisfying the conditions of the problem.
We have that $N^2 - N = N(N - 1)\equiv 0\mod{10000}$
Thus, $N(N-1)$ must be divisible by both $5^4$ and $2^4$
Note, however, that if either $N$ or $N-1$ has both a $5$ and a $2$ in its factorization, the other must end in either $1$ or $9$, which is impossible for a number that is divisible by either $2$ or $5$
Thus, one of them is divisible by $2^4 = 16$, and the other is divisible by $5^4 = 625$
Noting that $625 \equiv 1\mod{16}$, we see that $625$ would work for $N$, except the thousands digit is $0$
The other possibility is that $N$ is a multiple of $16$ and $N-1$ is a multiple of $625$
In order for this to happen,\[N-1 \equiv -1 \pmod {16}.\]Since $625 \equiv 1 \pmod{16}$, we know that $15 \cdot 625 = 9375 \equiv 15 \equiv -1 \mod{16}$
Thus, $N-1 = 9375$, so $N = 9376$, and our answer is $\boxed{937}$.
Notice repeating decimals can be written as the following:
$0.\overline{ab}=\frac{10a+b}{99}$
$0.\overline{abc}=\frac{100a+10b+c}{999}$
where a,b,c are the digits
Now we plug this back into the original fraction:
$\frac{10a+b}{99}+\frac{100a+10b+c}{999}=\frac{33}{37}$
Multiply both sides by $999*99.$ This helps simplify the right side as well because $999=111*9=37*3*9$:
$9990a+999b+9900a+990b+99c=33/37*37*3*9*99=33*3*9*99$
Dividing both sides by $9$ and simplifying gives:
$2210a+221b+11c=99^2=9801$
At this point, seeing the $221$ factor common to both a and b is crucial to simplify
This is because taking $mod 221$ to both sides results in:
$2210a+221b+11c  \equiv 9801 \mod 221 \iff 11c  \equiv 77 \mod 221$
Notice that we arrived to the result $9801 \equiv 77 \mod 221$ by simply dividing $9801$ by $221$ and seeing $9801=44*221+77.$ Okay, now it's pretty clear to divide both sides by $11$ in the modular equation but we have to worry about $221$ being multiple of $11.$ Well, $220$ is a multiple of $11$ so clearly, $221$ couldn't be
Also, $221=13*17.$ Now finally we simplify and get:
$c \equiv 7 \mod 221$
But we know $c$ is between $0$ and $9$ because it is a digit, so $c$ must be $7.$ Now it is straightforward from here to find $a$ and $b$:
$2210a+221b+11(7)=9801 \iff 221(10a+b)=9724 \iff 10a+b=44$
and since a and b are both between $0$ and $9$, we have $a=b=4$
Finally we have the $3$ digit integer $\boxed{447}$.
We claim that an integer $N$ is only $k$-nice if and only if $N \equiv 1 \pmod k$
By the number of divisors formula, the number of divisors of $\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{a_i}$ is $\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i+1)$
Since all the $a_i$s are divisible by $k$ in a perfect $k$ power, the only if part of the claim follows
To show that all numbers $N \equiv 1 \pmod k$ are $k$-nice, write $N=bk+1$
Note that $2^{kb}$ has the desired number of factors and is a perfect kth power
By PIE, the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are either $1 \pmod 7$ or $1\pmod 8$ is $143+125-18=250$, so the desired answer is $999-250=\boxed{749}$.
Writing out the recursive statement for $a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_{10}$ and summing them gives\[a_n+\dots+a_{10}=100(a_{n-1}+\dots+a_{10})+n+\dots+10\]Which simplifies to\[a_n=99(a_{n-1}+\dots+a_{10})+\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)\]Therefore, $a_n$ is divisible by 99 if and only if $\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)$ is divisible by 99, so $(n+10)(n-9)$ needs to be divisible by 9 and 11
Assume that $n+10$ is a multiple of 11
Writing out a few terms, $n=12, 23, 34, 45$, we see that $n=45$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case
Next, assume that $n-9$ is a multiple of 11
Writing out a few terms, $n=20, 31, 42, 53$, we see that $n=53$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case
The smallest $n$ is $\boxed{45}$.
Note that we can also construct the solution using CRT by assuming either $11$ divides $n+10$ and $9$ divides $n-9$, or $9$ divides $n+10$ and $11$ divides $n-9$, and taking the smaller solution.
Let's express the number in terms of $10^n$
We can obtain $(10-1)+(10^2-1)+(10^3-1)+\cdots+(10^{321}-1)$
By the commutative and associative property, we can group it into $(10+10^2+10^3+\cdots+10^{321})-321$
We know the former will yield $1111....10$, so we only have to figure out what the last few digits are
There are currently $321$ 1's
We know the last four digits are $1110$, and that the others will not be affected if we subtract $321$
If we do so, we get that $1110-321=789$
This method will remove three $1$'s, and add a $7$, $8$ and $9$
Therefore, the sum of the digits is $(321-3)+7+8+9=\boxed{342}$.
We know that $2019^8 \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$
We want to find the smallest odd possible value of $p$
By squaring both sides of the congruence, we find $2019^{16} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.
Since $2019^{16} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.
However, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1 \pmod{p},$ which contradicts the given requirement that $2019^8\equiv -1\pmod{p}$.
Therefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$
Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\phi(p)$, we see that $\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$
As $p$ is prime, $\phi(p) = p\left(1 - \dfrac{1}{p}\right) = p - 1$
Therefore, $p\equiv 1 \pmod{16}$
The two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$
As $2019^8 \not\equiv -1 \pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \equiv -1 \pmod{97}$, the smallest possible $p$ is thus $\boxed{97}$.
Add the two equations to get that $\log x+\log y+2(\log(\gcd(x,y))+\log(\text{lcm}(x,y)))=630$
Then, we use the theorem $\log a+\log b=\log ab$ to get the equation, $\log (xy)+2(\log(\gcd(x,y))+\log(\text{lcm}(x,y)))=630$
Using the theorem that $\gcd(x,y) \cdot \text{lcm}(x,y)=x\cdot y$, along with the previously mentioned theorem, we can get the equation $3\log(xy)=630$
This can easily be simplified to $\log(xy)=210$, or $xy = 10^{210}$.
$10^{210}$ can be factored into $2^{210} \cdot 5^{210}$, and $m+n$ equals to the sum of the exponents of $2$ and $5$, which is $210+210 = 420$
Multiply by two to get $2m +2n$, which is $840$
Then, use the first equation ($\log x + 2\log(\gcd(x,y)) = 60$) to show that $x$ has to have lower degrees of $2$ and $5$ than $y$ (you can also test when $x>y$, which is a contradiction to the restrains you set before)
Therefore, $\gcd(x,y)=x$
Then, turn the equation into $3\log x = 60$, which yields $\log x = 20$, or $x = 10^{20}$
Factor this into $2^{20} \cdot 5^{20}$, and add the two 20's, resulting in $m$, which is $40$
Add $m$ to $2m + 2n$ (which is $840$) to get $40+840 = \boxed{880}$.
In order to obtain a sum of $7$, we must have:
either a number with $5$ divisors (a fourth power of a prime) and a number with $2$ divisors (a prime), or
a number with $4$ divisors (a semiprime or a cube of a prime) and a number with $3$ divisors (a square of a prime)
(No integer greater than $1$ can have fewer than $2$ divisors.)
Since both of these cases contain a number with an odd number of divisors, that number must be an even power of a prime
These can come in the form of a square-like $3^2$ with $3$ divisors, or a fourth power like $2^4$ with $5$ divisors
We then find the smallest such values by hand.
$2^2$ has two possibilities: $3$ and $4$ or $4$ and $5$
Neither works.
$3^2$ has two possibilities: $8$ and $9$ or $9$ and $10$
$(8,9)$ and $(9,10)$ both work.
$2^4$ has two possibilities: $15$ and $16$ or $16$ and $17$
Only $(16,17)$ works.
$5^2$ has two possibilities: $24$ and $25$ or $25$ and $26$
Only $(25,26)$ works.
$7^2$ has two possibilities: $48$ and $49$ or $49$ and $50$
Neither works.
$3^4$ has two possibilities: $80$ and $81$ or $81$ and $82$
Neither works.
$11^2$ has two possibilities: $120$ and $121$ or $121$ and $122$
Only $(121,122)$ works.
$13^2$ has two possibilities: $168$ and $169$ or $169$ and $170$
Neither works.
$17^2$ has two possibilities: $288$ and $289$ or $289$ and $290$
Neither works.
$19^2$ has two possibilities: $360$ and $361$ or $361$ and $362$
Only $(361,362)$ works.
Having computed the working possibilities, we take the sum of the corresponding values of $n$: $8+9+16+25+121+361 = \boxed{540}$.
By the Chicken McNugget theorem, the least possible value of $n$ such that $91$ cents cannot be formed satisfies $5n - (5 + n) = 91 \implies n = 24$, so $n$ must be at least $24$.
For a value of $n$ to work, we must not only be unable to form the value $91$, but we must also be able to form the values $92$ through $96$, as with these five values, we can form any value greater than $96$ by using additional $5$ cent stamps.
Notice that we must form the value $96$ without forming the value $91$
If we use any $5$ cent stamps when forming $96$, we could simply remove one to get $91$
This means that we must obtain the value $96$ using only stamps of denominations $n$ and $n+1$.
Recalling that $n \geq 24$, we can easily figure out the working $(n,n+1)$ pairs that can used to obtain $96$, as we can use at most $\frac{96}{24}=4$ stamps without going over
The potential sets are $(24, 25), (31, 32), (32, 33), (47, 48), (48, 49), (95, 96)$, and $(96, 97)$.
The last two obviously do not work, since they are too large to form the values $92$ through $94$, and by a little testing, only $(24, 25)$ and $(47, 48)$ can form the necessary values, so $n \in \{24, 47\}$
$24 + 47 = \boxed{71}$.
Every 20-pretty integer can be written in form $n = 2^a 5^b k$, where $a \ge 2$, $b \ge 1$, $\gcd(k,10) = 1$, and $d(n) = 20$, where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$
Thus, we have $20 = (a+1)(b+1)d(k)$, using the fact that the divisor function is multiplicative
As $(a+1)(b+1)$ must be a divisor of 20, there are not many cases to check.
If $a+1 = 4$, then $b+1 = 5$
But this leads to no solutions, as $(a,b) = (3,4)$ gives $2^3 5^4 > 2019$.
If $a+1 = 5$, then $b+1 = 2$ or $4$
The first case gives $n = 2^4 \cdot 5^1 \cdot p$ where $p$ is a prime other than 2 or 5
Thus we have $80p < 2019 \implies p = 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$
The sum of all such $n$ is $80(3+7+11+13+17+19+23) = 7440$
In the second case $b+1 = 4$ and $d(k) = 1$, and there is one solution $n = 2^4 \cdot 5^3 = 2000$.
If $a+1 = 10$, then $b+1 = 2$, but this gives $2^9 \cdot 5^1 > 2019$
No other values for $a+1$ work.
Then we have $\frac{S}{20} = \frac{80(3+7+11+13+17+19+23) + 2000}{20} = 372 + 100 = \boxed{472}$.
Taking inspiration from $4^4 \mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \implies n = 121$
Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \geq 22$
Now, $\gcd(m+n, 210) = \gcd(11+k,210) = 1$
Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$
Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\boxed{407}$.
Let's work backwards
The minimum base-sixteen representation of $g(n)$ that cannot be expressed using only the digits $0$ through $9$ is $A_{16}$, which is equal to $10$ in base 10
Thus, the sum of the digits of the base-eight representation of the sum of the digits of $f(n)$ is $10$
The minimum value for which this is achieved is $37_8$
We have that $37_8 = 31$
Thus, the sum of the digits of the base-four representation of $n$ is $31$
The minimum value for which this is achieved is $13,333,333,333_4$
We just need this value in base 10 modulo 1000
We get $13,333,333,333_4 = 3(1 + 4 + 4^2 + \dots + 4^8 + 4^9) + 4^{10} = 3\left(\dfrac{4^{10} - 1}{3}\right) + 4^{10} = 2*4^{10} - 1$
Taking this value modulo $1000$, we get the final answer of $\boxed{151}$.
First notice that the graphs of $(n+1000)/70$ and $\sqrt[]{n}$ intersect at 2 points
Then, notice that $(n+1000)/70$ must be an integer
This means that n is congruent to $50 \pmod{70}$.
For the first intersection, testing the first few values of $n$ (adding $70$ to $n$ each time and noticing the left side increases by $1$ each time) yields $n=20$ and $n=21$
Estimating from the graph can narrow down the other cases, being $n=47$, $n=50$
This results in a total of $\boxed{6}$ cases.
The smallest $n$ that works is $4$ with $2^4=16$ and the largest is $6$ with $2^6=64,$ so $n$ can be $4,\ 5,$ or $6$ for $\boxed{3}$ such numbers.
We claim that, between any two fractions $a/b$ and $c/d$, if $bc-ad=1$, the fraction with smallest denominator between them is $\frac{a+c}{b+d}$
To prove this, we see that
\[\frac{1}{bd}=\frac{c}{d}-\frac{a}{b}=\left(\frac{c}{d}-\frac{p}{q}\right)+\left(\frac{p}{q}-\frac{a}{b}\right) \geq \frac{1}{dq}+\frac{1}{bq},\]which reduces to $q\geq b+d$
We can easily find that $p=a+c$, giving an answer of $\boxed{7}$.
Since prime factorizing $323$ gives you $17 \cdot 19$, the desired answer needs to be a multiple of $17$ or $19$, this is because if it is not a multiple of $17$ or $19$, $n$ will be more than a $4$ digit number
For example, if the answer were to instead be $324$, $n$ would have to be a multiple of $2^2 * 3^4 * 17 * 19$ for both $323$ and $324$ to be a valid factor, meaning $n$ would have to be at least $104652$, which is too big
Looking at the answer choices, $\text{(A) }324$ and $\text{(B) }330$ are both not a multiple of neither 17 nor 19, $\text{(C) }340$ is divisible by $17$
$\text{(D) }361$ is divisible by $19$, and $\text{(E) }646$ is divisible by both $17$ and $19$
Since $\boxed{340}$ is the smallest number divisible by either $17$ or $19$ it is the answer
Checking, we can see that $n$ would be $6460$, a four-digit number
Note that $n$ is also divisible by $2$, one of the listed divisors of $n$
(If $n$ was not divisible by $2$, we would need to look for a different divisor)
Observe $A_n = a(1 + 10 + \dots + 10^{n - 1}) = a \cdot \tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$; similarly $B_n = b \cdot \tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ and $C_n = c \cdot \tfrac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$
The relation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ rewrites as\[c \cdot \frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \cdot \frac{10^n - 1}{9} = a^2 \cdot \left(\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\right)^2.\]Since $n > 0$, $10^n > 1$ and we may cancel out a factor of $\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ to obtain\[c \cdot (10^n + 1) - b = a^2 \cdot \frac{10^n - 1}{9}.\]This is a linear equation in $10^n$
Thus, if two distinct values of $n$ satisfy it, then all values of $n$ will
Now we plug in $n=0$ and $n=1$ (or some other number), we get $2c - b = 0$ and $11c - b= a^2$
Solving the equations for $c$ and $b$, we get\[c = \frac{a^2}{9} \quad \text{and} \quad c - b = -\frac{a^2}{9} \implies b = \frac{2a^2}{9}.\]To maximize $a + b + c = a + \tfrac{a^2}{3}$, we need to maximize $a$
Since $b$ and $c$ must be integers, $a$ must be a multiple of $3$
If $a = 9$ then $b$ exceeds $9$
However, if $a = 6$ then $b = 8$ and $c = 4$ for an answer of $\boxed{18}$.
The GCD information tells us that $24$ divides $a$, both $24$ and $36$ divide $b$, both $36$ and $54$ divide $c$, and $54$ divides $d$
Note that we have the prime factorizations:\begin{align*} 24 &= 2^3\cdot 3,\\ 36 &= 2^2\cdot 3^2,\\ 54 &= 2\cdot 3^3
\end{align*}
Hence we have\begin{align*} a &= 2^3\cdot 3\cdot w\\ b &= 2^3\cdot 3^2\cdot x\\ c &= 2^2\cdot 3^3\cdot y\\ d &= 2\cdot 3^3\cdot z \end{align*}for some positive integers $w,x,y,z$
Now if $3$ divdes $w$, then $\gcd(a,b)$ would be at least $2^3\cdot 3^2$ which is too large, hence $3$ does not divide $w$
Similarly, if $2$ divides $z$, then $\gcd(c,d)$ would be at least $2^2\cdot 3^3$ which is too large, so $2$ does not divide $z$
Therefore,\[\gcd(a,d)=2\cdot 3\cdot \gcd(w,z)\]where neither $2$ nor $3$ divide $\gcd(w,z)$
In other words, $\gcd(w,z)$ is divisible only by primes that are at least $5$
The only possible value of $\gcd(a,d)$ between $70$ and $100$ and which fits this criterion is $78=2\cdot3\cdot13$, so the answer is $\boxed{13}$.
This looks like balanced ternary, in which all the integers with absolute values less than $\frac{3^n}{2}$ are represented in $n$ digits
There are 8 digits
Plugging in 8 into the formula for the balanced ternary gives a maximum bound of $|x|=3280.5$, which means there are 3280 positive integers, 0, and 3280 negative integers
Since we want all nonnegative integers, there are $3280+1=\boxed{3281}$.
We write\[\frac{3^{100}+2^{100}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}=\frac{3^{96}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}\cdot\frac{3^{100}}{3^{96}}+\frac{2^{96}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}\cdot\frac{2^{100}}{2^{96}}=\frac{3^{96}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}\cdot 81+\frac{2^{96}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}\cdot 16.\]Hence we see that our number is a weighted average of 81 and 16, extremely heavily weighted toward 81
Hence the number is ever so slightly less than 81, so the answer is $\boxed{80}$.
Let us simplify the problem
Since all of Isabella's test scores can be expressed as the sum of $90$ and an integer between $1$ and $10$, we rewrite the problem into receiving scores between $1$ and $10$
Later, we can add $90$ to her score to obtain the real answer.
From this point of view, the problem states that Isabella's score on the seventh test was $5$
We note that Isabella received $7$ integer scores out of $1$ to $10$
Since $5$ is already given as the seventh test score, the possible scores for Isabella on the other six tests are $S={1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10}$.
The average score for the seven tests must be an integer
In other words, six distinct integers must be picked from set $S$ above, and their sum with $5$ must be a multiple of $7$
The interval containing the possible sums of the six numbers in S are from $1 +2+3+4+6+7=23$ to $4+6+7+8+9+10=44$
We must now find multiples of $7$ from the interval $23+5 = 28$ to $44+5=49$
There are four possibilities: $28$, $35$, $42$, $49$
However, we also note that the sum of the six numbers (besides $5$) must be a multiple of $6$ as well
Thus, $35$ is the only valid choice.(The six numbers sum to $30$.)
Thus the sum of the six numbers equals to $30$
We apply the logic above in a similar way for the sum of the scores from the first test to the fifth test
The sum must be a multiple of $5$
The possible interval is from $1+2+3+4+6=16$ to $6+7+8+9+10=40$
Since the sum of the five scores must be less than $30$, the only possibilities are $20$ and $25$
However, we notice that $25$ does not work because the seventh score turns out to be $5$ from the calculation
Therefore, the sum of Isabella's scores from test $1$ to $5$ is $20$
Therefore, her score on the sixth test is $10$
Our final answer is $10+90=  \boxed{100}$.
We will consider this number $\bmod\ 5$ and $\bmod\ 9$
By looking at the last digit, it is obvious that the number is $\equiv 4\bmod\ 5$
To calculate the number $\bmod\ 9$, note that
\[123456\cdots 4344 \equiv 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+(1+0)+(1+1)+\cdots+(4+3)+(4+4) \equiv 1+2+\cdots+44 \bmod\ 9,\]
so it is equivalent to
\[\frac{44\cdot 45}{2} = 22\cdot 45 \equiv 0\bmod\ 9.\]
Let $x$ be the remainder when this number is divided by $45$
We know that $x\equiv 0 \pmod {9}$ and $x\equiv 4 \pmod {5}$, so by the Chinese remainder theorem, since $9(-1)\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, $x\equiv 5(0)+9(-1)(4) \pmod {5\cdot 9}$, or $x\equiv -36 \equiv \boxed{9} \pmod {45}$.
Note that $n \equiv S(n) \pmod{9}$
This can be seen from the fact that $\sum_{k=0}^{n}10^{k}a_k \equiv \sum_{k=0}^{n}a_k \pmod{9}$
Thus, if $S(n) = 1274$, then $n \equiv 5 \pmod{9}$, and thus $n+1 \equiv S(n+1) \equiv 6 \pmod{9}$
The only answer choice that is $6 \pmod{9}$ is $\boxed{1239}$.
Since the prime factorization of $110$ is $2 \cdot 5 \cdot 11$, we have that the number is equal to $2 \cdot 5 \cdot 11 \cdot n^3$
This has $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2=8$ factors when $n=1$
This needs a multiple of 11 factors, which we can achieve by setting $n=2^3$, so we have $2^{10} \cdot 5 \cdot 11$ has $44$ factors
To achieve the desired $110$ factors, we need the number of factors to also be divisible by $5$, so we can set $n=2^3 \cdot 5$, so $2^{10} \cdot 5^4 \cdot 11$ has $110$ factors
Therefore, $n=2^3 \cdot 5$
In order to find the number of factors of $81n^4$, we raise this to the fourth power and multiply it by $81$, and find the factors of that number
We have $3^4 \cdot 2^{12} \cdot 5^4$, and this has $5 \cdot 13 \cdot 5=\boxed{325}$ factors.
By Vieta's Formula, $a$ is the sum of the integral zeros of the function, and so $a$ is integral.
Because the zeros are integral, the discriminant of the function, $a^2 - 8a$, is a perfect square, say $k^2$
Then adding 16 to both sides and completing the square yields\[(a - 4)^2 = k^2 + 16.\]Therefore $(a-4)^2 - k^2 = 16$ and\[((a-4) - k)((a-4) + k) = 16.\]Let $(a-4) - k = u$ and $(a-4) + k = v$; then, $a-4 = \dfrac{u+v}{2}$ and so $a = \dfrac{u+v}{2} + 4$
Listing all possible $(u, v)$ pairs (not counting transpositions because this does not affect ($u + v$), $(2, 8), (4, 4), (-2, -8), (-4, -4)$, yields $a = 9, 8, -1, 0$
These $a$ sum to $16$, so our answer is $\boxed{16}$.
Note that $2014\equiv -3 \mod2017$
We have for $k\ge1$\[\dbinom{2014}{k}\equiv \frac{(-3)(-4)(-5)....(-2-k)}{k!}\mod 2017\]\[\equiv (-1)^k\dbinom{k+2}{k} \mod 2017\]\[\equiv (-1)^k\dbinom{k+2}{2} \mod 2017\]Therefore\[\sum \limits_{k=0}^{62} \dbinom{2014}{k}\equiv \sum \limits_{k=0}^{62}(-1)^k\dbinom{k+2}{2} \mod 2017\]This is simply an alternating series of triangular numbers that goes like this: $1-3+6-10+15-21....$ After finding the first few sums of the series, it becomes apparent that\[\sum \limits_{k=1}^{n}(-1)^k\dbinom{k+2}{2}\equiv -\left(\frac{n+1}{2} \right) \left(\frac{n+1}{2}+1 \right) \mod 2017 \textnormal{  if n is odd}\]and\[\sum \limits_{k=1}^{n}(-1)^k\dbinom{k+2}{2}\equiv \left(\frac{n}{2}+1 \right)^2 \mod 2017 \textnormal{  if n is even}\]Obviously, $62$ falls in the second category, so our desired value is\[\left(\frac{62}{2}+1 \right)^2 = 32^2 = \boxed{1024}\]
The number $I_k$ can be written as $10^{k+2} + 64 = 5^{k+2}\cdot 2^{k+2} + 2^6$.
For $k\in\{1,2,3\}$ we have $I_k = 2^{k+2} \left( 5^{k+2} + 2^{4-k} \right)$
The first value in the parentheses is odd, the second one is even, hence their sum is odd and we have $N(k)=k+2\leq 5$.
For $k>4$ we have $I_k=2^6 \left( 5^{k+2}\cdot 2^{k-4} + 1 \right)$
For $k>4$ the value in the parentheses is odd, hence $N(k)=6$.
This leaves the case $k=4$
We have $I_4 = 2^6 \left( 5^6 + 1 \right)$
The value $5^6 + 1$ is obviously even
And as $5\equiv 1 \pmod 4$, we have $5^6 \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, and therefore $5^6 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod 4$
Hence the largest power of $2$ that divides $5^6+1$ is $2^1$, and this gives us the desired maximum of the function $N$: $N(4) = \boxed{7}$.
The fact that $x \equiv 0 \mod 7 \Rightarrow 7 \mid x$ is assumed as common knowledge in this answer.
First, note that there are $8$ possible numbers that are equivalent to $1 \mod 7$, and there are $7$ possible numbers equivalent to each of $2$-$6 \mod 7$.
Second, note that there can be no pairs of numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a \equiv -b$ mod $7$, because then $a+b | 7$
These pairs are $(0,0)$, $(1,6)$, $(2,5)$, and $(3,4)$
Because $(0,0)$ is a pair, there can always be $1$ number equivalent to $0 \mod 7$, and no more.
To maximize the amount of numbers in S, we will use $1$ number equivalent to $0 \mod 7$, $8$ numbers equivalent to $1$, and $14$ numbers equivalent to $2$-$5$
This is obvious if you think for a moment
Therefore the answer is $1+8+14=\boxed{23}$ numbers.
Notice that inclusion of the integers from $34$ to $100$ is allowed as long as no integer between $11$ and $33$ inclusive is within the set
This provides a total of $100 - 34 + 1$ = 67 solutions.
Further analyzation of the remaining integers between $1$ and $10$, we notice that we can include all the numbers except $3$ (as including $3$ would force us to remove both $9$ and $1$) to obtain the maximum number of $9$ solutions.
Thus, $67 + 9 = \boxed{76}$.
Observe that for all $k \in 1< k< n$, since $k$ divides $n!$, $k$ also divides $n!+k$
Therefore, all numbers $a$ in the range $n!+1<a<n!+n$ are composite
Therefore there are $\boxed{}$ primes in that range.
Let $a = 2^x$ and $b = 3^y$
Substituting these values results in\[a^2 - b^2 = 55\]Factor the difference of squares to get\[(a + b)(a - b) = 55\]If $y < 0$, then $55 + 3^{2y} < 64$, so $y$ can not be negative
If $x < 0$, then $2^{2x} < 1$
Since $3^{2y}$ is always positive, the result would be way less than $55$, so $x$ can not be negative
Thus, $x$ and $y$ have to be nonnegative, so $a$ and $b$ are integers
Thus,\[a+b=55 \text{ and } a-b=1\]\[\text{or}\]\[a+b=11 \text{ and } a-b=5\]From the first case, $a = 28$ and $b = 27$
Since $2^x = 28$ does not have an integral solution, the first case does not work
From the second case, $a = 8$ and $b = 3$
Thus, $x = 3$ and $y = 1$
Thus, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution.
First, note that $n$ does not have a prime number larger than $61$ as one of its factors
Also, note that $n$ does not equal $1$.
Therefore, since the prime factorization of $n$ only has primes from $2$ to $59$, $n$ and $P$ share at least one common factor other than $1$
Therefore $P+n$ is not prime for any $n$, so the answer is $\boxed{}$.
First, factor the difference of squares.\[(m+n)(m-n)\]Since $m$ and $n$ are odd numbers, let $m=2a+1$ and $n=2b+1$, where $a$ and $b$ can be any integer.\[(2a+2b+2)(2a-2b)\]Factor the resulting expression.\[4(a+b+1)(a-b)\]If $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $a-b$ is even
If $a$ and $b$ are both odd, then $a-b$ is even as well
If $a$ is odd and $b$ is even (or vise versa), then $a+b+1$ is even
Therefore, in all cases, $8$ can be divided into all numbers with the form $m^2-n^2$.
This can be confirmed by setting $m=3$ and $n=1$, making $m^2-n^2=9-1=8$
Since $8$ is not a multiple of $3$ and is less than $16$, we can confirm that the answer is $\boxed{8}$.
\begin{align*}[(a^2 + 2^a) + a \cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}][(a^2 + 2^a) - a \cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}] &= (a^2 + 2^a)^2 - a^2 \cdot 2^{a+1}\\ &= a^4 + 2 \cdot a^22^{a} + 2^{2a} - a^2 \cdot 2^{a+1}\\ &= a^4 + 2^{2a}\end{align*}
(If you recall the reverse of Sophie Germain Identity with $a=a,\, b = 2^{(a-1)/2}$, then you could have directly found the answer).
By Fermat's Little Theorem, we have that $a^{4} \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ if $a \nmid 5$ and $a^{4} \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$ if $a | 5$
Also, we note that by examining a couple of terms, $2^{2a} \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$ if $a \nmid 2$ and $2^{2a} \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ if $a|2$
Therefore,\[a^{4} + 2^{2a} \equiv \{0,1\} + \{1,4\} \equiv \{0,1,2,4\} \pmod{5}\]With divisibility by $5$ achievable only if $a \nmid 2,5$
There are $\frac{251-1}{2}+1 = 126$ odd numbers in the range given, and $\frac{245-5}{10}+1 = 25$ of those are divisible by $5$, so the answer is $126 - 25 = \boxed{101}$.
We have $11\equiv 2\pmod 9$
Therefore, we have \begin{align*}
11^5 &\equiv 2^5 \\
&= 32 \\
&\equiv \boxed{5}\pmod 9.
\end{align*}
Rewrite the expression as\[4(5x + 1)(5x + 3)(5x+5)\]Since $x$ is odd, let $x = 2n-1$
The expression becomes\[4(10n-4)(10n-2)(10n)=32(5n-2)(5n-1)(5n)\]Consider just the product of the last three terms, $5n-2,5n-1,5n$, which are consecutive
At least one term must be divisible by $2$ and one term must be divisible by $3$ then
Also, since there is the $5n$ term, the expression must be divisible by $5$
Therefore, the minimum integer that always divides the expression must be $32 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = \boxed{960}$.
To prove that the number is the largest integer to work, consider when $x=1$ and $x = 5$
These respectively evaluate to be $1920,\ 87360$; their greatest common factor is indeed $960$.
The first condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be an even power (excluding $2$, which must be an odd power)
The second condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $3$ (excluding $3$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $3$)
The third condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $5$ (excluding $5$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $5$).
Clearly, to minimize $n$, we want to just use the prime factors $2,3,5$
The power of $2$ must be divisible by $3,5$, and $2^{15}$ works
Similarly, the powers of $3$ and $5$ must be $10$ and $6$, respectively, both of which leave a residue of $1$ upon division
Thus, we need the number of factors of $2^{15} \cdot 3^{10} \cdot 5^{6}$ which are not multiples of $10$.
Applying the complement principle, there are a total of $(15+1)(10+1)(6+1) = 1232$ factors
We can draw a bijection between the number of divisors of $2^{15} \cdot 3^{10} \cdot 5^{6}$ that are divisible by $10$ and the number of divisors of $2^{14} \cdot 3^{10} \cdot 5^{5}$ (as each of these divisors, when multiplied by 10, will provide a factor of the original number that is divisible by 10)
There are $(14+1)(10+1)(5+1) = 990$
The answer is $1232-990 = \boxed{242}$.
We find the sum of all possible hundreds digits, then tens digits, then units digits
Every one of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ may appear as the hundreds digit, and there are $9 \cdot 8 = 72$ choices for the tens and units digits
Thus the sum of the hundreds places is $(1+2+3+\cdots+9)(72) \times 100 = 45 \cdot 72 \cdot 100 = 324000$.
Every one of $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ may appear as the tens digit; however, since $0$ does not contribute to this sum, we can ignore it
Then there are $8$ choices left for the hundreds digit, and $8$ choices afterwards for the units digit (since the units digit may also be $0$)
Thus, the the sum of the tens digit gives $45 \cdot 64 \cdot 10 = 28800$.
The same argument applies to the units digit, and the sum of them is $45 \cdot 64 \cdot 1 = 2880$
Then $S = 324000+28800+2880 = 355\boxed{680}$.
By the geometric series formula, $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \cdots + 7^{2004} = \frac{7^{2005}-1}{7-1} = \frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$
Since $\varphi(1000) = 400$, by Fermat-Euler's Theorem, this is equivalent to finding $\frac{7^{400 \cdot 5 + 5} - 1}{6} \equiv \frac{7^5 - 1}{6} \equiv \boxed{801} \pmod{1000}$.
If $n^2 + 12n - 2007 = m^2$, we can complete the square on the left-hand side to get $n^2 + 12n + 36 = m^2 + 2043$ so $(n+6)^2 = m^2 + 2043$
Subtracting $m^2$ and factoring the left-hand side, we get $(n + m + 6)(n - m + 6) = 2043$
$2043 = 3^2 \cdot 227$, which can be split into two factors in 3 ways, $2043 \cdot 1 = 3 \cdot 681 = 227 \cdot 9$
This gives us three pairs of equations to solve for $n$:
$n + m + 6 = 2043$ and $n - m + 6 = 1$ give $2n + 12 = 2044$ and $n = 1016$.
$n + m + 6 = 681$ and $n - m + 6 = 3$ give $2n + 12 = 684$ and $n = 336$.
$n + m + 6 = 227$ and $n - m + 6 = 9$ give $2n + 12 = 236$ and $n = 112$.
Finally, $1016 + 336 + 112 = 1464$, so the answer is $\boxed{464}$.
Note that $2004 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 167$
We focus on the large prime $167$ as the powers of $2$ and $3$ in the prime factorization of $2004!$ are going to be much higher
The largest power of $167$ that divides $2004!$ is $\tfrac{2004}{167} = \boxed{12}$, the answer.
Note that $5^n$ has the same number of digits as $5^{n-1}$ if and only if $5^{n-1}$ has a leading digit $1$
Therefore, there are $2004 - 1401 = 603$ numbers with leading digit $1$ among the set $\{5^1, 5^2, 5^3, \cdots 5^{2003}\}.$ However, $5^0$ also starts with $1$, so the answer is $603 + 1 = \boxed{604}$.
Let $k = d_1 d_2 d_3 \ldots d_{12}$, the first $12$ decimal digits of $\tfrac{1}{n}$
We can see that\[(10^{12} - 1)\left(\dfrac{1}{n}\right) = k \implies kn = 10^{12} - 1,\]so $S$ is the set that contains all divisors of $10^{12} - 1$ except for $1$
Since\[10^{12} - 1 = (10^6 + 1)(10^6 - 1) = (10^2 + 1)(10^4 - 10^2 + 1)(10^3 + 1)(10^3 - 1) = 101 \cdot 9901 \cdot 37 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \cdot 7 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 37,\]the number $10^{12} -1$ has $4 \cdot 2^6 = 256$ divisors and our answer is $256 - 1 = \boxed{255}.$
Let $\omega$ and $\zeta$ be the two complex third-roots of 1
Then let
$S = (1 + \omega)^{2007} + (1 + \zeta)^{2007} + (1 + 1)^{2007} = \sum_{i = 0}^{2007} {2007 \choose i}(\omega^i + \zeta^i + 1)$.
Now, if $i$ is a multiple of 3, $\omega^i + \zeta^i + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$
If $i$ is one more than a multiple of 3, $\omega^i + \zeta^i + 1 = \omega + \zeta + 1 = 0$
If $i$ is two more than a multiple of 3, $\omega^i + \zeta^i + 1 = \omega^2 + \zeta^2 + 1= \zeta + \omega + 1 = 0$
$S = \sum_{i = 0}^{669} 3 {2007 \choose 3i}$, which is exactly three times our desired expression.
We also have an alternative method for calculating $S$: we know that $\{\omega, \zeta\} = \{-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt 3}{2}i, -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt 3}{2}i\}$, so $\{1 + \omega, 1 + \zeta\} = \{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt 3}{2}i, \frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt 3}{2}i\}$
Note that these two numbers are both cube roots of -1, so $S = (1 + \omega)^{2007} + (1 + \zeta)^{2007} + (1 + 1)^{2007} = (-1)^{669} + (-1)^{669} + 2^{2007} = 2^{2007} - 2$.
Thus, the problem is reduced to calculating $2^{2007} - 2 \pmod{1000}$
$2^{2007} \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$, so we need to find $2^{2007} \pmod{125}$ and then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem
Since $\phi (125) = 100$, by Euler's Totient Theorem $2^{20 \cdot 100 + 7} \equiv 2^7 \equiv 3 \pmod{125}$
Combining, we have $2^{2007} \equiv 128 \pmod{1000}$, and so $3S \equiv 128-2 \pmod{1000} \Rightarrow S\equiv \boxed{42}\pmod{1000}$.
Using the Carmichael function, we have $\lambda(1000)=100$, so $3^{100}=1\pmod{1000}$
Therefore, letting $N=3^{3^3}$, we seek to find an $n$ such that $N\equiv n\pmod{100}$ so that $3^N\equiv 3^n\pmod{1000}$.
Using the Carmichael function again, we have $\lambda(100)=20$, so $N=3^{27}\equiv 3^7\pmod{100}\equiv 87\pmod{100}$
Therefore $n=87$, and so we have the following:\[3^{3^{3^3}}\equiv 3^{87}\pmod{1000}.\]
\begin{align*}3^{87}=(3^{20})^4\cdot 3^7&\equiv 401^4\cdot 187\pmod{1000} \\ &\equiv 601\cdot 187\pmod{1000} \\ &\equiv \boxed{387}\pmod{1000}
\end{align*}
We start by generating powers of 9 modulo 17
Note that we can generate $9^{2k}$ from $9^k$ by squaring $9^k$
We get \begin{align*}
9^1 &\equiv 9 \pmod{17} \\
9^2 &\equiv 13 \pmod{17} \\
9^4 &\equiv 16 \pmod{17} \\
9^8 &\equiv 1 \pmod{17}.
\end{align*}Since $9^8 \equiv 1$ modulo 17, we have \begin{align*}
9^{2010} &\equiv 9^2 9^{2008} \\
&\equiv 9^2 (9^8)^{251} \\
&\equiv 9^2 1^{251} \\
&\equiv 9^2 \\
&\equiv \boxed{13} \pmod{17}.
\end{align*}
We have $\gcd(n,100) = \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n,100]-450$
Since $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n,100]$ is a multiple of $100$, we infer that $\gcd(n,100)$ is a multiple of $50$ but not of $100$
But $\gcd(n,100)$ is also a divisor of $100$, so it can only be $50$.
This implies two conclusions: first, $n$ is a multiple of $50$ (but not of $100$); second, $$\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \gcd(n,100)+450 = 50+450 = 500.$$In particular, $n$ is less than $500$, so we need only check the possibilities $n=50,150,250,350,450$
Of these, only $250$ satisfies our second conclusion, so $n=250$ is the unique solution -- and the sum of all solutions is thus $\boxed{250}$.
First we convert to base 10, obtaining $427_8 = 4 \cdot 8^2 + 2 \cdot 8^1 + 7 \cdot 8^0 = 279.$ Then we convert 279 to base 5 to get  \begin{align*}
279 &= 2 \cdot 5^3 + 29 \\
&= 2 \cdot 5^3 + 1 \cdot 5^2 + 4 \\
&= 2 \cdot 5^3 + 1 \cdot 5^2 + 4 \cdot 5^0 \\
&=\boxed{2104_5}.
\end{align*}
You need to test the primes less than a number between $\sqrt{900}=30$ and $\sqrt{950}<31$, so the largest prime divisor you need to test is $\boxed{29}$.
If we have at least $5$ grapes left, we can give each student one more, so they do not have the greatest possible number
On the other hand, if we have $4$ grapes left, we cannot give out any more without leaving out at least one student
So $\boxed{4}$ grapes is the maximum that we throw out.
We long divide as follows: $$
\begin{array}{c|c@{\hspace{0pt}}c@{\hspace{0pt}}c@{\hspace{0pt}}c@{\hspace{0pt}}c@{\hspace{0pt}}c@{\hspace{0pt}}c@{\hspace{0pt}}c}

$$ So the remainder is $\boxed{22}$.
$$\text{-OR-}$$
Assuming use of a calculator, we can divide $987,\!670$ by 128 to find that the quotient is between 7716 and 7717
Subtracting the product of 7716 and 128 from $987,\!670$ gives $\boxed{22}$.
We want to know the remainder when $45+116+4+229$ is divided by 11
The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \[45+116+4+229\equiv1+6+4+9=20\equiv9\pmod{11}.\]Therefore Winnie has $\boxed{9}$ lollipops left over after the distribution
Hopefully she did not keep any shrimp cocktails.
The first odd multiple of 3 is 3
The next is 9, then 15, 21, adding 6 each time
The $n$th odd multiple of 3 is $6n-3$; the 10th odd multiple of 3 is therefore $60-3=\boxed{57}$.
We try plugging in values for $p$ and see if $11p+1$ is a prime number
The smallest prime number is $2$, so we try $11(2)+1=23$, which is prime
The value of $q$ is $\boxed{23}$.
$3 \cdot 1 = 3$, so the units digit of the product is $\boxed{3}$.
Produce an exhaustive list of the pairs of factors which multiply to give 60, as well as the sum and the difference of each pair of factors
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
Factors & Sum & Difference \\ \hline

(2,30) & 32 & 28 \\
(3,20) & 23 & 17 \\
(4,15) & 19 & 11 \\
(5,12) & 17 & 7 \\
(6,10) & 16 & 4
\end{tabular} The only number which appears in both the second column and the third column is 17
Therefore, $(A,B)=(20,3)$ and $(C,D)=(5,12)\text{ or }(12,5)$
In particular, $A=\boxed{20}$.
Timothy's quotient is an integer if and only if Josef's number is a divisor of 1000
Our goal is to count the positive divisors of $1000 = 2^3 \cdot 5^3$
We see that 1000 has $(3 + 1)(3+1) = 16$ positive divisors, hence there are $\boxed{16}$ integers Josef could pick to make Timothy's number an integer.
Notice that the question is essentially asking us for the greatest common divisor of $2002$ and $44444$: any number that can be written in the given form must be divisible by the greatest common divisor of $2002$ and $44444$
Conversely, we can find the values of $m$ and $n$ through repeated applications of the Euclidean algorithm
In particular, \begin{align*}
&\text{gcd}\,(2002, 44444) \\
&\qquad= \text{gcd}\,(2002, 44444 - 22 \cdot 2002)\\&\qquad = \text{gcd}\,(2002, 400) \\
&\qquad= \text{gcd}\,(2002 - 5 \cdot (44444 - 22 \cdot 2002), 400) \\&\qquad= \text{gcd}\,(2, 400) \\
&\qquad= \boxed{2}.
\end{align*}Notice that \begin{align*}
&2002 - 5 \cdot (44444 - 22 \cdot 2002)\\ &\qquad= 2002 - 5 \cdot 44444 + 110 \cdot 2002 \\ &\qquad= (111) \cdot 2002 + (-5) \cdot 44444 \\ &\qquad= 2,\end{align*}as desired.
For a base $b$ representation of $100_{10}$ to have exactly $5$ digits, the largest power of $b$ that is less than $100$ must be $4$
Therefore, we have the requirement that $b^4 \le 100 < b^5$
We then realize that $b=3$ satisfies this requirement since $3^4 < 100 < 3^5$
We also realize that this is the only possible value of $b$ since if $b$ were equal to $2$, $b^5 = 2^5$ would be less than $100$ and if $b$ were equal to $4$, $b^4 = 4^4$ would be greater than $100$
Thus, our only solution is $b = \boxed{3}$.
If Eleanor made $N$ cookies, we know from the first requirement that $N = 11x + 4$ for some integer $x,$ and from the second requirement we know that $N = 7y+1$ for some integer $y.$ Therefore,  $$11x+4 = 7y+1\Rightarrow 11x+3 = 7y$$If we list the possible values of $11x+3$ such that $N = 11x+4<100,$ we have $14,$ $25,$ $36,$ $47,$ $58,$ $69,$ $80,$ $91.$ The only members of this list divisible by $7$ are $14$ and $91,$ and so the possible values of $$11x+4 = 7y+1$$are $14+1 = 15$ and $91+1 = 92$, and thus the sum of the possible numbers of cookies is $15+92 =\boxed{107}.$
For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number
Therefore, it suffices to check the smallest composite numbers that are not divisible by $6$
We find that:
$\bullet$ for $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,
$\bullet$ for $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,
$\bullet$ for $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,
$\bullet$ for $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,
$\bullet$ for $14$, $1 + 2 + 7< 14$,
$\bullet$ for $15$, $1 + 3 + 5< 15$,
$\bullet$ for $16$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 < 16$,
$\bullet$ for $20$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22 > 20$.
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{20}$.
The only numbers that have 11 and 8 as a factor are multiples of 88
If we list the first few multiples of 88: $$88,176,264,352,...$$ we can see that there are exactly $\boxed{2}$ between 100 and 300.
A cube is divisible by $9$ if the number being cubed is divisible by $\sqrt[3]{9}=3^{\frac{2}{3}}.$ Since a perfect cube is the cube of an integer, we need the number being cubed to be a multiple of $3,$ so the cube is of the form $(3n)^3=27n^3$
Since $\frac{999}{27}=37,$ the cubes we need are $27$ times a cube less than or equal to $37,$ of which there are three
However, $27\cdot1^3=27,$ only has two digits, leaving $\boxed{2}$ such three-digit cubes.
Call the two integers $a$ and $b$
Recall that the product of two numbers' LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves: $$\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]\cdot \gcd(a,b) = ab.$$This can be rearranged to give $$\gcd(a,b) = \frac{ab}{\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]}.$$In this case, we know that $a<10^6$ and $b<10^6$, so $ab<10^{12}$
We also know that $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]\ge 10^9$, since the smallest 10-digit number is $10^9$.
Therefore, $$\gcd(a,b) < \frac{10^{12}}{10^9} = 10^3,$$so $\gcd(a,b)$ has at most $\boxed{3}$ digits.
(We should check that there are actual integers $a$ and $b$ for which $\gcd(a,b)$ has $3$ digits
There are; for example, we can take $a=500{,}000$ and $b=200{,}100$, in which case the least common multiple is $1{,}000{,}500{,}000$ and the greatest common divisor is $100$.)
The divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42
They can be paired off into four pairs in such a way that the product of each pair is 42:  \begin{align*}
\{1&,42\}, \\
\{2&, 21\},\\
\{3&, 14\}, \text{and}\\
\{6&, 7\}.
\end{align*}Thus $A=42^4=(2\cdot3\cdot7)^4=2^4\cdot3^4\cdot7^4$ has $\boxed{3}$ prime divisors.
We note that any integer whose digits' sum is $18=2\cdot9$ is divisible by 9
Therefore, we need to find the largest three-digit number whose digits' sum is 18
That number is $\boxed{990}$.
The number $AB_7$ is $7A + B$, and the number $BA_5$ is $5B + A$, so $7A + B = 5B + A$
Then $6A = 4B$, so $3A = 2B$
Then $B$ must be a multiple of 3
But $B$ is also a digit in base 5, so $B = 3$, and $A = 2$
The number is $7A + 2 = \boxed{17}$.
Since $-3737 \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$, the integer $n$ we seek is $n = \boxed{7}$.
In $f(x)$, all terms will have a multiple of $x$ except for the constant term, which is the multiple of the four constants $3,2,7$, and $13$.
Recall (from the Euclidean algorithm) that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $a-kb$ where $k,a,$ and $b$ are any integers
Therefore, finding the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is the same as finding the greatest common divisor of $x$ and the constant term of $f(x)$
Therefore, we want to find \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,((2x+3)(7x+2)(13x+7)(x+13),x) &=\text{gcd}\,(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 13, x)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(546,x).
\end{align*}Since $23478$ is a multiple of $546$, the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is $\boxed{546}$.
We can rewrite $0.865$ as $\frac{865}{10^3}$, set it equal to the fraction, and solve for $a$: \begin{align*}
\frac{a}{a+27}&=\frac{865}{10^3}\quad\Rightarrow\quad \\
10^3a&=865a+865\cdot27\quad\Rightarrow\\
(10^3-865)a&=865\cdot27\quad\Rightarrow\\
135a&=865\cdot27\quad\Rightarrow\\
a&=\frac{865\cdot27}{135} \\
&=\frac{865\cdot27}{5\cdot27}=\frac{865}{5}=\boxed{173}.
\end{align*}
We are looking for pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy both $y\equiv 5x+2$ and $y\equiv 11x+12\pmod{16}$
Thus, the $x$-coordinates in all such pairs satisfy $$5x+2 \equiv 11x+12\pmod{16}.$$Subtracting $5x+2$ from both sides of this congruence, we have $$0 \equiv 6x+10\pmod{16},$$which is equivalent to $$0 \equiv 6x-6\pmod{16}$$(since $10\equiv -6\pmod{16}$).
Thus the solutions we seek are values $x$ in the range $0\le x<16$ such that $16$ divides $6(x-1)$
The solutions are $x=1,$ $x=9,$ so the sum of $x$-coordinates is $1+9=\boxed{10}$.
(As a check, note that the pairs $(1,7)$ and $(9,15)$ satisfy both of the original congruences, so these are the points shared by the two graphs.)
We notice that the marbles appear in strings of 5 gray, 4 white, 3 black
These strings have 12 marbles each
Since  \[158=13\cdot12+2,\]there are 13 full strings of marbles and 2 extras
Since the first 5 marbles in any group are gray, the two extra marbles must be $\boxed{\text{gray}}$.
Obviously, $1$ is not a primitive root $\pmod 7$ (its powers are all congruent to $1$!).
Examining the powers of $2$, we see that $\{2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4,\ldots\} \equiv \{2,4,1,2,\ldots\}$ with repetition from this point onward
Since the powers of $2$ do not include all residues from $1$ to $6\pmod 7$, we see that $2$ is not a primitive root.
The logic of this example can be generalized
If $a$ is an integer and $a^k\equiv 1\pmod p$, then the powers of $a$ repeat on a cycle of length at most $k$
Therefore, for $a$ to be a primitive root, it is necessary that $a^k\not\equiv 1\pmod p$ for all positive $k$ smaller than $p-1$
Conversely, if $a^k\equiv 1\pmod p$ for some positive $k$ smaller than $p-1$, then $a$ is not a primitive root $\pmod p$
As examples, $4$ and $6$ are not primitive roots $\pmod 7$, because $4^3\equiv 1\pmod 7$ and $6^2\equiv 1\pmod 7$.
This leaves $3$ and $5$ as candidates
Checking the powers of $3$ and $5$ modulo $7$, we see that \begin{align*}
3^1\equiv 3,~ 3^2\equiv 2,~3^3 \equiv 6,~3^4\equiv 4,~3^5\equiv 5,~ 3^6\equiv 1;\\
5^1\equiv 5,~ 5^2\equiv 4,~5^3 \equiv 6,~5^4\equiv 2,~5^5\equiv 3,~ 5^6\equiv 1.\,
\end{align*}Thus, $3,5$ are primitive roots of $7$, so the desired sum is $3+5=\boxed{8}$.
The decimal representation of $\frac{5}{13}$ is $0.\overline{384615}$, which repeats every 6 digits
Since 534 is a multiple of 6, the 534th digit is the same as the last digit in the repeating block, which is $\boxed{5}$.
Terminating decimals can be expressed as $\frac{a}{10^b}$
So, we try to get our fraction in this form: $$\frac{11}{125} = \frac{11}{5^3} = \frac{11}{5^3} \cdot \frac{2^3}{2^3} = \frac{11\cdot2^3}{10^3} = \frac{88}{1000} = \boxed{0.088}.$$
Since $6=2\times3$, the members of the arithmetic sequences with a common difference of 6 that start with 2 or 3 are multiples of 2 or 3 and hence not prime
Therefore, let's start with the next prime, 5, and form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29
All five members of the sequence are prime, so we can now compute the sum
The sum of those five prime numbers is $5+11+17+23+29=\boxed{85}$.
We begin by replacing the coefficients and constants in the equation with their residues modulo 23
We find that 3874 divided by 23 gives a remainder of 10, 481 divided by 23 gives a remainder of 21, and 1205 gives a remainder of 9
So the given congruence is equivalent to  $$
10x + 21 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}.
$$Now add 2 to both sides to obtain $$
10x \equiv 11 \pmod{23}.
$$Notice that we have replaced 23 with 0 on the left-hand side, since $23\equiv 0\pmod{23}$
Now let us find the modular inverse of 10
We want to find an integer which is divisible by 10 and one more than a multiple of 23
Note that since the units digit of 23 is 3, the units digit of $3\times 23$ is 9, so $3\times 23+1$ is a multiple of 10
Thus $(3\times23+1)/10=7$ is the modular inverse of 10
Multiplying both sides of $10x \equiv 11 \pmod{23}$ by 7 gives $x\equiv 77 \pmod{23}$, which implies $x\equiv 8\pmod{23} $
So the three digit solutions are  \begin{align*}
8+23\times 4 &= 100 \\
8+23\times 5 &= 123 \\
&\vdots \\
8+23\times 43 &= 997,
\end{align*}of which there are $\boxed{40}$.
Since 3 and 4 are relatively prime, their least common multiple is $3\cdot4=12$
Therefore, the least common multiple of 30 and 40 is 120
Since $\boxed{120}$ is not divisible by 16, it is the smallest common multiple of 30 and 40 which is not divisible by 16.
Note: Every common multiple of two integers is a multiple of their least common multiple
Therefore, it is not possible that the least common multiple is divisible by 16 but some other common multiple is not.
Let $n = 15r$
Clearly, $r>14$, because $15!$ contains 15 as a factor and all integers less than 15 as factors
If $r=15$, then $n=225$, However, $15! = 15 \cdot 5 \cdot 3s$, so $r > 15$
If $r=16$, then $n=240$
However, $15! = 15 \cdot 8 \cdot 2t$, so $r > 16$
If $r=17$, then $n = 255$
Note that $f(255) = 17$ because the smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 17 is $k = 17$, because 17 is prime
Therefore, the smallest multiple of 15 that fits the desired condition is $\boxed{n = 255}$.
We compute that $4!=1\times 2\times 3\times 4 = 2^{3}\times 3=24$
So we want exactly the numbers in the set $\{1,\ldots,24\}$ which are divisible by neither $2$ nor $3$, since an integer $a$ is invertible modulo $n$ for some positive integer $n$ if and only if $\gcd(a,n)=1$
These turn out to be $\{1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23\}$
Then \begin{align*}
m & \equiv 1\cdot 5\cdot 7\cdot 11\cdot 13\cdot 17\cdot 19\cdot 23\\
& \equiv 1\cdot 5\cdot 7\cdot 11\cdot (-11)\cdot (-7)\cdot (-5)\cdot (-1)\\
& \equiv (5\cdot 7\cdot 11)^2\\
& \equiv (35\cdot 11)^2\\
& \equiv (11\cdot 11)^2\\
& \equiv (121)^2\\
& \equiv 1^2\\
& \equiv \boxed{1}\pmod {24}
\end{align*}
The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$
Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \cdot 3 = 1$, so $\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.
The sum of the first three numbers is $57+13+72=142$
If we let $10a+b$ represent the last number, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively, then the sum of the four numbers is $142+10a+b$
The sum of the digits of the first three numbers is $5+7+1+3+7+2=25$, so the total sum of the digits is $25+a+b$
If we multiply the sum of the digits by 5, we should get the sum of the four numbers
\begin{align*}
142+10a+b&=5(25+a+b)\quad\Rightarrow\\
&=125+5a+5b\quad\Rightarrow\\
17+5a&=4b
\end{align*} We notice that if we add a multiple of 5 to 17, the ones digit will either be 2 or 7
The next multiple of 4 that is greater than 17 and ends with a 2 or 7 is 32
That means $b=8$, while $17+5a=32$, so $5a=15$ and $a=3$
So the last number is $\boxed{38}$.
The prime factorization of $210$ is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$
It follows that the sum of the divisors of $210$ is equal to $(1 + 2)(1 + 3)(1+5)(1+7)$, as each factor of $210$ is represented when the product is expanded
It follows that the answer is equal to $3 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 = \boxed{576}$.
49 days is seven full weeks, so there are always $\boxed{7}$ Sundays.
Let $n$ be any integer that has its square between 4000 and 7000
Then $63 < n < 84$, because $63^2 < 4000<64^2$ and $83^2< 7000<84^2$
Between 63 and 84, the only primes are 67, 71, 73, 79, and 83
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{5}$.
According to the problem statement, we have the system of linear congruences \begin{align*}
m &\equiv 0 \pmod{6} \\
m &\equiv 2 \pmod{8} \\
m &\equiv 2 \pmod{5}.
\end{align*} It follows by the Chinese Remainder Theorem that $m \equiv 2 \pmod{40}$
The only number that satisfies this criterion for $30 \le m \le 80$ is $m = \boxed{42}$, which is indeed divisible by $6$.
Let $n$ be the other integer, so \[\frac{\mathop{\text{lcm}}[45,n]}{\gcd(45,n)} = 33.\]We know that $\gcd(m,n) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, so \[\gcd(45,n) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[45,n] = 45n.\]Dividing this equation by the previous equation, we get \[[\gcd(45,n)]^2 = \frac{45n}{33} = \frac{15n}{11},\]so $11 [\gcd(45,n)]^2 = 15n$.
Since 11 divides the left-hand side, 11 also divides the right-hand side, which means $n$ is divisible by 11
Also, 15 divides the right-hand side, so 15 divides the left-hand side, which means $\gcd(45,n)$ is divisible by 15
Since $45 = 3 \cdot 15$, $n$ is divisible by 15
Hence, $n$ must be divisible by $11 \cdot 15 = 165$.
Note that $\gcd(45,165) = 15$ and $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[45,165] = 495$, and $495/15 = 33$, so $n=165$ is achievable and the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\boxed{165}$.
We begin by finding the fractional forms of the decimals, $0.\overline{789}$, $0.\overline{456}$, and $0.\overline{123}$
Let $x=0.\overline{789}$, then $1000x=789.\overline{789}$ and $1000x-x=789.\overline{789}-0.789 \implies 999x - 789$
Therefore, $0.\overline{789}=\frac{789}{999}$
We use the same method to find that $0.\overline{456}=\frac{456}{999}$ and $0.\overline{123}=\frac{123}{999}$
Next, we perform the indicated operations, knowing that $0.\overline{789}-0.\overline{456}-0.\overline{123}=\frac{789}{999}-\frac{456}{999}-\frac{123}{999}$
This equals $\frac{210}{999}$, which simplifies to $\boxed{\frac{70}{333}}$, when both the numerator and the denominator are divided by $3$.
We can use the Euclidean Algorithm
The closest multiple of $2a+9$ that we can spot to $6a^2 + 49a + 108$ is $6a^2 + 49a + 99 = (2a+9)(3a+11),$ so we have
\begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,(6a^2+49a+108,2a+9)
&=\text{gcd}\,(6a^2+49a+108-(2a+9)(3a+11),2a+9)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(6a^2+49a+108-(6a^2+49a+99),2a+9)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(9,2a+9).
\end{align*}Since $7767$ is a multiple of 9, both $2a$ and $9$ are multiples of $9$, $2a+9$ is also a multiple of $9$ so the greatest common divisor is $\boxed{9}$.
An integer is a multiple of 15 if and only if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5
The multiple of 5 closest to 2009 is 2010, and since $2+0+1+0$ is divisible by 3, $\boxed{2010}$ is divisible by 15.
The greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer is $777_8$, which is equal to $7 \cdot 8^2 + 7 \cdot 8 + 7 = 511$
This number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, so we subtract 1, to get $\boxed{776_8}$.
Note that $\gcd(168,693) = 21$
Since $\gcd(a,b) = 168 = 8 \cdot 21$, both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 21
Since $\gcd(a,c) = 693 = 21 \cdot 33$, both $a$ and $c$ are divisible by 21
Therefore, $\gcd(b,c)$ must be at least 21.
If we take $a = 5544$ (which is $21 \cdot 8 \cdot 33$), $b = 168$, and $c = 693$, then $\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(5544,168) = 168$, $\gcd(a,c) = \gcd(5544,693) = 693$, and $\gcd(b,c) = \gcd(168,693) = 21$, which shows that the value of 21 is attainable
Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\gcd(b,c)$ is $\boxed{21}$.
We can call the four integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ $c$, and $d$
Then we have \begin{align*}
a &\equiv 2\pmod{11}, \\
b &\equiv 4\pmod{11}, \\
c &\equiv 6\pmod{11}, \\
d &\equiv 8\pmod{11}.
\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \begin{align*}
a+b+c+d &\equiv 2+4+6+8 \\
&\equiv 20\pmod{11}.
\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c+d$ has the same remainder as $20$ upon division by $11$
This remainder is $\boxed{9}$.
Let $s$ be the number of small chips and $l$ be the number of large chips
From the given information, we have $s+l=54$ and $s=l+p$ for some prime $p$
Thus, $2l+p=54$
We wish to maximize $l$, so we must minimize $p$
Therefore, we set $p=2$ to get $l=\boxed{26}$.
We can write $0.428125$ in the form $\frac{428,\!125}{1,\!000,\!000}$
Note that $428,\!000$ and $125$ are divisible by $5^3=125$
Therefore, we can divide numerator and denominator by 125 to obtain \begin{align*}
\frac{428,\!125}{1,\!000,\!000} &= \frac{125 \cdot 3425}{125 \cdot 8000}\\
&=\frac{3425}{8000}.
\end{align*}Since 3425 and 8000 are divisible by 25, we can simplify the fraction further: \begin{align*}
\frac{428,\!125}{1,\!000,\!000} &= \frac{3425}{8000} \\
&= \frac{5^2\cdot 137}{5^2\cdot 320} \\
&= \frac{137}{320}.
\end{align*}The sum of the numerator and denominator is $137 + 320 = \boxed{457}$.
Let $a$ be the desired number
We know that \begin{align*}
a & \equiv 0\pmod 2\\
a & \equiv 1\pmod 3\\
a & \equiv 2\pmod 4
\end{align*} Note that $a \equiv 2\pmod 4$ automatically implies $a \equiv 0\pmod 2$, so only $a \equiv 1\pmod 3$ and $a \equiv 2\pmod 4$ need to be considered
The first few positive solutions of $a \equiv 2\pmod 4$ are $2,6,10$
While the first two do not satisfy $a \equiv 1\pmod 3$, luckily $\boxed{10}$ does!
Every $6$ hours, Jason earns $1+2+3+4+5+6=\$21$
Since $39=6(6)+3$, he earns $6\cdot 21=\$126$ from $36$ hours, and in the next $3$ hours, he earns $1+2+3=\$6$
So he borrowed $126+6=\boxed{\$132}$.
We see that $(7 - n) + (n + 3) = 10 \equiv 3 \pmod 7,$ hence the remainder of the sum when divided by $7$ is $\boxed{3}.$
Since $73^2 \equiv (-1)^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{74}$, $73^{-1} \equiv \boxed{73} \pmod{74}$.
Using long division, we find that $\frac{33}{555}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.0\overline{594}$.
After the first digit, there is a three-digit repeating block
We want to find the $110$th digit after the first digit
The remainder when $110$ is divided by $3$ is $2$
Therefore, the $111$th digit is the second digit in the repeating block, which is $\boxed{9}$.
The sum of the whole-number factors of 24 is $1+24+2+12+3+8+4+6=\boxed{60}$.
By the Euclidean algorithm, \begin{align*}
&\text{gcd}\,(2^{1012}-1, 2^{1001}-1) \\
&\qquad= \text{gcd}\, (2^{1012}-1 - 2^{11}(2^{1001}-1), 2^{1001}-1) \\
&\qquad= \text{gcd}\,(2^{11}-1, 2^{1001}-1)
\end{align*} Using the divisibility rule for $11$, we know that $11$ divides into $1001$
Writing $2^{1001}$ as $(2^{11})^{91}$ and $1$ as $1^{91}$, we use the difference of odd powers factorization to find that   \[
2^{1001} - 1 = (2^{11})^{91}-1^{91} = (2^{11}-1)((2^{11})^{90} + (2^{11})^{89}+\cdots (2^{11})^1 + 1).
\] Thus $2^{1001}-1$ is divisible by $2^{11}-1$, so the greatest common divisor is $2^{11}-1 = \boxed{2047}$.
The desired integer has at least two digits
Let $d$ be its leftmost digit, and let $n$ be the integer that results when $d$ is deleted
Then for some positive integer $p$, $10^p\cdot
d+n=29n$, and so $10^p\cdot d=28n$
Therefore 7 is a divisor of $d$, and because $1\le d\le9$, it follows that $d=7$
Hence $10^p=4n$, so $\displaystyle n={{10^p}\over4}=
{{100\cdot10^{p-2}}\over4}=25\cdot10^{p-2}$
Thus every positive integer with the desired property must be of the form $7\cdot10^p+25\cdot10^{p-2}=10^{p-2}(7\cdot10^2+25)=725\cdot10^{p-2}$ for some $p\ge2$
The smallest such integer is $\boxed{725}$.
We start from $2^1$ and consider the remainder when successive powers of 2 are divided by 7
\begin{align*}
2^1 &\text{ leaves a remainder of 2}\\
2^2 &\text{ leaves a remainder of 4}\\
2^3 &\text{ leaves a remainder of 1}\\
2^4 &\text{ leaves a remainder of 2}\\
2^5 &\text{ leaves a remainder of 4}\\
2^6 &\text{ leaves a remainder of 1}\\
&\hphantom{\text{ leaves a re}}\vdots
\end{align*} Since 2004 is divisible by 3 (the digits sum to 6, which is a multiple of 3), we find that $2^{2005}$ leaves a remainder of $\boxed{2}$ when divided by 7.
From the second given congruence, we have $$c\equiv 3\cdot 5c\equiv 3\cdot 2\equiv 6\pmod 7.$$From the third given congruence, we have $$5b\equiv 3\pmod 7$$$$\implies b\equiv 3\cdot 5b\equiv 3\cdot 3\equiv 2\pmod 7.$$Then, from the first given congruence, we have $$1\equiv abc a\cdot 6\cdot 2\equiv 12a\equiv 5a\pmod 7$$$$\implies a\equiv 3\cdot 5a\equiv 3\cdot 1\equiv 3\pmod 7.$$Thus, $$a+b+c\equiv 3+2+6\equiv \boxed{4}\pmod 7.$$
The five decimals sum to $0.12345$, which as a fraction is $\frac{12,\!345}{100,\!000}$
Since $100,\!000=2^5\cdot 5^5$, we only have to cancel factors of 2 or 5 from $12,\!345$
Since $12,\!345$ is odd, it has no factors of 2
Dividing by 5, we find that $\dfrac{12,\!345}{100,\!000}=\boxed{\dfrac{2469}{20,\!000}}$.
The prime numbers less than $12$ are $2,3,5,7,11$
Since $2$ is the only even prime out of the five primes less than $12$, the answer is $\frac{1}{5}=\frac{20}{100}=\boxed{20\%}$.
Let $n$ be a positive integer
Then $n^2$ has exactly $3$ digits in base 9 if and only if $$9^2\le n^2<9^3.$$Taking square roots, we have $$3^2\le n<3^3.$$We are looking for $N$, the ${\bf largest}$ integer $n$ satisfying the above constraints
So, $$N=3^3-1=3\cdot 9-1 =2\cdot 9+8.$$Written in base $9$, this is $\boxed{28}$ or $\boxed{28_9}$.
$135_7 = 1\cdot7^2 + 3\cdot7^1 + 5\cdot7^0 = 49 + 21 + 5 = \boxed{75}.$
We use the property that $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \equiv b^c \pmod{m}$.
$333 \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$, therefore $333^{333} \equiv 3^{333} \pmod{11}$.
Since $3^5 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$, we get that $333^{333} \equiv 3^{333}=3^{5 \cdot 66 +3}=(3^5)^{66} \cdot 3^3 \equiv 1^{66} \cdot 27 \equiv \boxed{5} \pmod{11}$.
We have $840=2^3\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7$
From this prime factorization, it is clear that the product of four consecutive positive integers is $840=2^2\cdot5\cdot(2\cdot3)\cdot7=4\cdot5\cdot6\cdot7$
The largest of the four integers is $\boxed{7}$.
We are looking for an integer $a$ such that $27a$ is congruent to 1 modulo 28
In other words, we want to solve  \[
27 a \equiv 1 \pmod{28}.
\]We subtract $28a$ from the left-hand side to obtain $-a\equiv 1 \pmod{28}$
This congruence is equivalent to the previous one since $28a$ is a multiple of 28
Next we multiply both sides by $-1$ to obtain $a\equiv -1\pmod{28}$
Thus $28-1=\boxed{27}$ is the modular inverse of 27 (mod 28)
(Note that since $(m-1)^2=m^2-2m+1\equiv 1\pmod{m}$, we always have that $m-1$ is its own inverse modulo $m$.)
The minimum difference between two numbers whose sum is 87 is achieved when the numbers are as close as possible to $87\div2=43.5$
These numbers are 43 and 44, but 43 is prime, so we consider the next pair, 42 and 45, both of which are composite
Thus, the minimum positive difference is $45-42=\boxed{3}$.
After converting everything to base 10, we are able to solve for $\triangle$
We get \begin{align*}
3\triangle_4&=\triangle2_{11}\quad\Rightarrow\\
3\cdot4^1+\triangle\cdot4^0&=\triangle\cdot11^1+2\cdot11^0\quad\Rightarrow\\
12+\triangle&=11\cdot\triangle+2\quad\Rightarrow\\
10&=10\cdot\triangle\quad\Rightarrow\\
\boxed{1}&=\triangle.
\end{align*}
If the repeated four-digit integer is $n$, then the eight-digit integer is $10^4n+n=10001n$
So all numbers in this form share the factor 10001
Consider $10001\cdot1000$ and $10001\cdot1001$
After dividing out the factor 10001, 1000 and 1001 share no nontrivial factors, so the greatest common divisor must be exactly $\boxed{10001}$.
The prime factorization of $27000$ is $2^3\cdot 3^3\cdot 5^3.$ These three factors, $2^3,$ $3^3,$ and $5^3$ are pairwise relatively prime, and this is the only possible triple of positive integers satisfying the given conditions
Therefore, the answer is \[2^3+3^3+5^3=8+27+125=\boxed{160}.\]
First we note that 16 stones are enumerated before the pattern repeats
Therefore, if the count enumerates a stone as $n$, then that stone is enumerated $k$ for every  \[k\equiv n\pmod{16}\] (though all but the end stones are represented by two residue classes in this way).
Since $99\equiv3\pmod{16}$, stone number $\boxed{3}$ is counted as 99.
One could add them up by carrying in base $2$
But there is a simpler way
Note that the first number is $2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5+2^6+2^7$, which, by the formula for geometric series, is $2^8-1=256-1=255$
The second number is $2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5=2^6-1=64-1=63$
Thus the sum is $255+63=305+13=\boxed{318}$.
We know that the modular inverse exists because $11$ and $1000$ are relatively prime
Notice that $1000 = 10^3$ and that $11 = 10 + 1$
Since $11 \cdot 11^{-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{1000}$, it follows that $(10+1) \cdot 11^{-1} = 10^3k + 1$ for some integer $k$
We recognize the potential sum of cubes factorization: if $k=1$, then $$10^3 + 1 = 1001 = 11 \cdot (10^2 - 10 + 1) = 11 \cdot 91.$$Thus, $11^{-1} \equiv \boxed{91} \pmod{1000}$.
Let $10!$ be written in base 9 as $a_na_{n-1}\cdots a_1a_0$, where $10! = 9^na_n + 9^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \cdots + 9a_1 + a_0$, and let $k$ be the number of zeroes at the end of the base 9 expansion of $10!$
This means that $9^k$ divides $10!$ without yielding a remainder, because $9^{k-1}a_{k-1} + \cdots + 9a_1 + a_0 = 0$, and every other term on the left-hand side is divisible by $9^k$
However, since $a_k$ is nonzero, $9^{k+1}$ does not divide $10!$
Therefore, we need to find the highest power of $9$ that divides $10!$ without remainder
We can prime factorize $10!$ by prime factorizing each integer between 2 and 10
The exponent of 3 in the prime factorization of $10!$ is 4, since 3 and 6 each contribute one factor of 3 while 9 contributes two
Therefore, $9^2$ divides $10!$ while $9^3$ does not
As a result, when $10!$ is written in base 9, it ends in $\boxed{2}$ zeroes.
When summing these three numbers, we notice that $5 + 4 + 1$ leaves a residue of $1$ when divided by $9$, so it follows that the sum has a rightmost digit of $1$ and that carry-over must occur
After carrying over to the next digit, we must find the sum of $1 + 7 + 1 + 6 = 16_9$, which leaves a residue of $6$ when divided by $9$
Thus, we write down $6$ as the next digit and carry-over another $1$
Evaluating the next digit, we must find the sum of $1+1+7 = 10_9$, which leaves a residue of $0$ when divided by $9$
Thus, we must carry-over one more time, yielding that: $$ \begin{array}{c@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \stackrel{1}{1} & \stackrel{1}{7} & \stackrel{}{5}_{9} \\ & & & 7 & 1 & 4_{9} \\ &+ & & & 6 & 1_{9} \\ \cline{2-6} && 1 & 0 & 6 & 1_{9} \\ \end{array} $$Thus, the answer is $\boxed{1061_{9}}$.
Alternatively, we can notice that $175_9 + 714_9 = 1000_9$, so $1000_9 + 61_9 = 1061_9$.
We can simplify as follows:
\begin{align*}
13(3x-2)&\equiv 26 &\pmod 8\\
3x-2&\equiv 2 &\pmod 8\\
3x&\equiv 4 &\pmod 8\\
9x&\equiv 4\cdot 3 &\pmod 8\\
x&\equiv 12 &\pmod 8\\
x&\equiv 4 &\pmod 8
\end{align*}So $x=4+8n$ is a solution for all $n$ and all solutions are of this form
The solutions in the range $0<x\le 20$ are $4,12,20$, so their sum is $4+12+20=\boxed{36}$.
Since the denominator of $\dfrac{3}{16}$ is $2^4$, we multiply numerator and denominator by $5^4$ to obtain  \[
\frac{3}{16} = \frac{3\cdot 5^4}{2^4\cdot 5^4} = \frac{3\cdot 625}{10^4} = \frac{1875}{10^4} = 0.1875.
\] The digit in the thousandths place is $\boxed{7}$.
We have that \begin{align*} 249_{11} &= 2(11^2)+ 4(11^1) +9(11^0) \\
&= 2(121)+4(11)+9(1)\\
&= 242 + 44 + 9\\
&= 295\\
3AB_{12} &= 3(12^2)+ 10(12^1) +11(12^0) \\
&= 3(144)+10(12)+11(1)\\
&= 432 + 120 + 11\\
&= 563
\end{align*}So, $249_{11}+3AB_{12}=295+563=\boxed{858}$.
Let $10a+b$ represent $n$, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively
Switching the digits and adding 3 results in $10b+a+3$, which we set equal to $2n$
\begin{align*}
2(10a+b)&=10b+a+3\quad\Rightarrow\\
20a+2b&=10b+a+3\quad\Rightarrow\\
19a&=8b+3
\end{align*}For the smallest $n$, we let the tens digit $a=1$
We have $19=8b+3$, which means $b=2$
So the smallest $n$ is $\boxed{12}$.
You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.
To be a $\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.
The problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27
Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.
It is much easier to find $10110_2\div10_2$ and then multiply by $10100_2$ than it is to do the calculations in the original order
For $10110_2\div10_2$, since the last digit of $10110_2$ is a 0, we can simply take it off to get $1011_2$
This is similar to base 10, where $10110_{10}\div10_{10}=1011_{10}$
In base 2, each place represents a power of 2, and since we're dividing by 2, each place goes down by a power 2, so each digit shifts to the right
Now we find the product of $1011_2$ and $10100_2$
$$\begin{array}{@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& & &1 &0 & 1 & 1_2 & & \\
& & & \times & 1& 0 & 1& 0 & 0_2 \\
\cline{1-9}& & &1 &0 &1 &1 & & \\
& & & & & &0 & & \\
& 1 &\stackrel{1}{0}&1 &1 &0 &0 &\downarrow &\downarrow \\
\cline{1-9}
&1 &1 &0 &1 &1 &1 &0 &0_2 \\
\end{array}$$The answer is $\boxed{11011100_2}$.
The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5
The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \cdot 5 \cdot 3$
For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $3$ in the numerator
There are $\left\lfloor \frac{120-1}{3} \right\rfloor+1=40$ multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $120$, so there are $\boxed{40}$ integers values for $n$.
A positive integer is a factor of $n$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\cdot 3^b\cdot 5^c$ where $0\leq a\leq 3$, $0\leq b\leq 2$, and $0\leq c\leq 1$
An integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1
Therefore, we have 3 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$ and $2$ choices for $c$, for a total of $(3)(3)(2)=\boxed{18}$ ways to form an even positive factor of $n$.
Note that $x + 2010 \equiv x \pmod{2010}$
Add 2010 to every negative summand and rearrange the terms to find $S \equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 2008 + 2009 \pmod{2010}$
The right-hand side is the sum of the integers from 1 to 2010, so $S \equiv \frac{2010 \cdot 2011}{2} \equiv 1005 \cdot 2011 \equiv 1005 \cdot 1 \equiv \boxed{1005} \pmod{2010}$.
We must solve the addition problem $$ \begin{array}{@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & S & E & A & S_d \\ & & & E & B & B_d \\ + & & & S & E & A_d\\ \cline{1-6} & & B & A& S& S_d\end{array},$$ where $d$ is an unknown base
It follows that $S + B + A$ leaves a residue of $S$ upon division by $d$
Thus, $B+A$ must be divisible by $d$
Since $B$ and $A$ cannot both be $0$, and $B+A < (d-1) + (d-1) = 2d-2$, then $B + A = d$.
Looking at the $d$s digit, we must carry-over $1$ from the units digit sum, so $1 + A + B + E \equiv S \pmod{d}$
Since $B + A = d$, then $1 + E + d \equiv 1+E \equiv S \pmod{d}$
Thus, $S = E+1$ or $E = d-1$ and $S = 0$
However, the latter is impossible since $S$ is the leftmost digit of 'SEAS' and 'SEA'
Thus, $S = E+1$, and we again carry-over $1$ to the $d^2$ digit.
Looking at the $d^2$ digit, after carry-over, it follows that $1 + E + E + S \equiv A \pmod{d}$
Note that $1 + E + E + S < 1 + 3(d-1) = 3d - 2 < 3d$
Then, $2E + S + 1 - A$ is either equal to $0$, $d$, or $2d$
However, we can immediately discard the $0$ case: there would be no carry-over for the leftmost digit, so $S = B$ are not distinct.
In the next case, if $2E + S + 1 = A + d$, then there is a carry-over of $1$ to the last digit
It follows that $S + 1 = B$
This gives us the system of equations \begin{align*}
B + A &= d \\
E + 1 &= S \\
S + 1 &= B \\
2E + S +1 - A&= d
\end{align*} Setting the first and fourth equations equal to each other yields that $d = B+A = 2E + S +1 - A$, and since $B = S+1 = E+2$, substituting for $B$ and $S$ yields that $2A = 3E + S + 1 - B = 2E + (E+1) + 1 - (E+2) = 2E$
This contradicts the distinct digits criterion.
Thus, $2E + S + 1 - A= 2d = 2(B+A)$, so $2E + S + 1 - 2B = 3A$
Also, we have that $B = S+2$, due to the carry-over in the leftmost digit
Substituting for $B$ and $S$ yields that $3A = 2E + (E+1) + 1 - 2(E + 3) = E - 4$, so $E = 3A+4$
Thus, $S = 3A+5$ and $B=3A+7$
Also, $S,E,$ and $A$ are decimal digits, so it follows that $S = 3A + 5 \le 9 \Longrightarrow A = 0,1$
We can discard the solution $A = 0$, as $d = B+A$ but $B < d$
Thus, $B = 10, S = 8, E = 7$, occurring in base $d = B+A = 11$
The answer is $\boxed{871}$.
The condition $r_9(5n)\le 4$ can also be stated as $``5n\equiv 0,1,2,3,\text{ or }4\pmod 9."$'
We can then restate that condition again by multiplying both sides by $2:$ $$10n \equiv 0,2,4,6,\text{ or }8\pmod 9.$$This step is reversible (since $2$ has an inverse modulo $9$)
Thus, it neither creates nor removes solutions
Moreover, the left side reduces to $n$ modulo $9,$ giving us the precise solution set $$n \equiv 0,2,4,6,\text{ or }8\pmod 9.$$We wish to determine the $22^{\text{nd}}$ nonnegative integer in this solution set
The first few solutions follow this pattern: $$\begin{array}{c c c c c}
0 & 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\
9 & 11 & 13 & 15 & 17 \\
18 & 20 & 22 & 24 & 26 \\
27 & 29 & 31 & 33 & 35 \\
36 & 38 & \cdots
\end{array}$$The $22^{\text{nd}}$ solution is $\boxed{38}.$
We would like to find $b$ for which $b^3 \leq 197_{10} < b^4.$ We can see that this inequality is satisfied for $4\leq b \leq 5.$ So, there are $\boxed{2}$ bases for which this holds.
For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number
Therefore, it suffices to check only composite numbers:
$\bullet$ For $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,
$\bullet$ For $6$, $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$,
$\bullet$ For $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,
$\bullet$ For $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,
$\bullet$ For $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,
$\bullet$ For $12$, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 > 12$.
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{12}$.
There are $60$ minutes in an hour
When $1234$ is divided by $60$, you get $20$ with a remainder of $34$
Therefore, the time in $1234$ minutes will be $\boxed{20\!:\!34}$ or $\boxed{8\!:\!34 \text{ p.m.}}$.
There are five prime numbers between $4$ and $18:$ namely $5,$ $7,$ $11,$ $13,$ and $17.$ Hence the product of any two of these is odd and the sum is even
Because $$xy-(x+y)=(x-1)(y-1)-1$$increases as either $x$ or $y$ increases (since both $x$ and $y$ are bigger than $1$), the answer must be an odd number that is no smaller than $$23=5\cdot 7-(5+7)$$and no larger than $$191=13\cdot 17-(13+17).$$The only possibility among the options is $\boxed{119},$ and indeed $119=11\cdot 13-(11+13).$
For $n$ to have an inverse $\pmod{1050}$, it is necessary for $n$ to be relatively prime to $1050$
Conversely, if $n$ is relatively prime to $1050$, then $n$ has an inverse $\pmod{1050}$.
The prime factors of $1050$ include $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$, so any multiple of any of these primes does not have an inverse $\pmod{1050}$
This rules out all the integers from $2$ to $10$
However, $11$ is relatively prime to $1050$, so $\boxed{11}$ is the smallest integer greater than $1$ that has an inverse $\pmod{1050}$.
$\frac{20\cdot 21\cdot 22\cdot 23\cdot 24\cdot 25}{1000} = \frac{2^2\cdot 5\cdot 21\cdot 2\cdot 11\cdot 23\cdot 2^3\cdot 3\cdot 5^2}{2^3\cdot 5^3} = 2^3\cdot 3\cdot 21 \cdot 11\cdot 23 \equiv 2^3\cdot 3^2 \pmod{10} \equiv \boxed{2}\pmod{10}$.
$54321_6=5\cdot6^4+4\cdot6^3+3\cdot6^2+2\cdot6^1+1\cdot6^0=6480+864+108+12+1=\boxed{7465}$.
We write each repeating decimal as a fraction
We convert $0.\overline{1}$ to a fraction by setting $0.\overline{1}=x$
Multiplying both sides by 10, we get $10x =1.\overline{1}$
We subtract those two equations to get \begin{align*}
10 x -x&=1.\overline{1}-0.\overline{1} \quad \implies \\
9 x&=1 \quad \implies \\
x &= \frac19.
\end{align*}Next, we convert $0.\overline{02}$ to a fraction by setting $0.\overline{02}=y$
Multiplying by 100, we get $100 y =2.\overline{02}$
We subtract those two equations to get: \begin{align*}
100 y - y &=2.\overline{02}-0.\overline{02} \quad \implies \\
99 y &=2 \quad \implies \\
y &= \frac{2}{99}.
\end{align*}Finally, we convert $0.\overline{003}$ to a fraction by setting $0.\overline{003}=z$
Multiplying by 1000, we get $1000z =3.\overline{003}$
We subtract those two numbers to get: \begin{align*}
1000 z -z &=3.\overline{003}-0.\overline{003} \quad \implies \\
999 z &=3 \quad \implies \\
z &= \frac{3}{999}.
\end{align*}The requested sum is $\frac19+\frac{2}{99}+\frac{3}{999}=\boxed{\frac{164}{1221}}$.
Only square numbers have an odd number of factors
The $\boxed{6}$ two-digit squares are 16, 25, 36, 49, 64 and 81.
$12345_{6} = 5\cdot6^{0}+4\cdot6^{1}+3\cdot6^{2}+2\cdot6^{3}+1\cdot6^{4} = 5+24+108+432+1296 = \boxed{1865}$.
We use the property $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ implies $ac \equiv bc \pmod{m}$.
Since all numbers with the units digit of $2$ has a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$ and we have $10$ numbers,  $$2 \times 12 \times 22 \times 32 \times \ldots \times 72 \times 82 \times 92 \equiv 2^{10} \equiv 1024 \equiv \boxed{4} \pmod{5}.$$
Long division in base $5$ follows the same format as that in base $10$.
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 4 & 3 \\

\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 4 & 1 \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 4 & 1 \\ \cline{4-5}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & & 0
\end{array} \]Giving us a final answer of $\boxed{43_5.}$
If we first get a "common denominator" as if 3 and 9 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\frac 13 + \frac 19 \equiv \frac{9 + 3}{27} \equiv \frac{12}{2} \equiv \boxed{6} \pmod{25}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \equiv 3^{-1} \pmod{25}$ and $b \equiv 9^{-1} \pmod{25}$
Then $27a \equiv 9 \pmod{25}$ and $27b \equiv 3 \pmod{25}$
Summing these congruences shows that $27(a+b) \equiv 2(a+b) \equiv 9 + 3 \equiv 12 \pmod{25}$, so $a+b \equiv 6 \pmod{25}$, as desired.
The largest power of 7 less than 956 is $7^3=343$
Therefore, $956$ written in base 7 has $3+1=\boxed{4}$ digits.
A day has $86,\!400$ seconds
$86,\!400=2^7\cdot3^3\cdot5^2$, so 86,400 has $(7+1)(3+1)(2+1)=96$ positive factors
Thus there are $96/2=48$ (unordered) pairs of factors each of whose product is $86,\!400.$ Since ``$n$ periods of $m$ seconds'' is different from ``$m$ periods of $n$ seconds,'' we need to multiply $48$ by $2$ to get our final answer of $\boxed{96}$ ways.
If the prime factorization of an integer is given as $p_1^{a_1}\cdot p_2^{a_2}\cdot p_3^{a_3}\cdot...$ the number of divisors will be: $$(a_1+1)(a_2+1)(a_3+1)...$$ So, we need to factor 14 in a similar manner to the expression above
We can write: $$14=(13+1)=(1+1)(6+1)$$ The smallest integer in the first case will be $2^{13}$, and the smallest in the second case will be $2^6\cdot 3^1=192$
Therefore, $\boxed{192}$ is clearly the smallest positive integer with exactly 14 positive divisors.
$AB -BA= 10\cdot A+B - (10\cdot B+A)= 9\cdot A-9\cdot B=3(3\cdot A-3\cdot B)$
If $A\neq B$, then the difference is a (non-zero) multiple of 3
Thus, $\boxed{3}$ must be a factor of $AB -BA$.
For every divisor $d$ of $50$, then $50/d$ is also a divisor of $50$
Their product is $d \cdot (50/d) = 50$
It follows that every divisor can be paired with another divisor of $50$ such that their product is $50 = 2 \cdot 5^2$
There are $(1+1)(2+1) = 6$ divisors of $50$: $1,2,5,10,25,50$
Thus, the answer is $50^{6/2} = 50^3 = \boxed{125,\!000}$.
Converting everything to base ten: \begin{align*}
\Diamond4_7&=\Diamond1_{8}\\
\Diamond\cdot7^1+4\cdot7^0&=\Diamond\cdot8^1+1\cdot8^0\\
7\Diamond+4&=8\Diamond+1\\
\Diamond&=\boxed{3}.
\end{align*}
To be divisible by both 5 and 11, an integer must be a multiple of 55
The smallest three-digit multiple of 55 is $2 \cdot 55 = 110,$ and the largest three-digit multiple of 55 is $18 \cdot 55 = 990$
So we can count the number of integers by the number of multiples, $2, 3, \ldots , 17 , 18$, of which there are $\boxed{17}$.
For a number $\underline{a}\underline{b}\underline{c}\underline{d}$ to be divisible by $11$, we need $(a+c)-(b+d)$ to be divisible by $11$
If the digits of $\underline{a}\underline{b}\underline{c}\underline{d}$ add up to $9$, then $(a+c)-(b+d)$ must be $0$, because $(a+c)-(b+d)$ cannot be as large as 11 or as small as $-11$ without having $a+c+b+d\geq 11$.
Now $(a+c)-(b+d)=0$ implies that $a+c=b+d$, which in turn implies that $a+c$ and $b+d$ have the same parity (that is, they are either both odd or both even)
Therefore, $a+b+c+d = (a+c)+(b+d)$ is even and therefore cannot be equal to $9$
So there are $\boxed{0}$ possible numbers.
Marsha has two equations: \[a=70n+64\]and \[b=105m+99.\]When she adds these she gets \begin{align*}
a+b&=70n+105m+64+99 \\
&=35(2n+3m)+163=35(2n+3m+4)+23.
\end{align*}The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 35 is $\boxed{23}$.
Replacing each term in the sum by a modulo 15 equivalent, we have \begin{align*}
&1+6+11+16+21+26+\cdots+91+96+101\\
&\qquad\equiv 1+6+11+1+6+11+\cdots+1+6+11 \pmod{15},
\end{align*}where the terms $1+6+11$ are repeated $7$ times on the right.
Since $1+6+11=18\equiv 3\pmod{15}$, we have \begin{align*}
1+6+11&+16+21+26+\cdots+91+96+101\\ &\equiv \underbrace{1+6+11}_3+\underbrace{1+6+11}_3+\cdots+\underbrace{1+6+11}_3 \\
&\equiv 7\cdot 3 \\
&= 21 \\
&\equiv \boxed{6}\pmod{15}.
\end{align*}
Since $0.\overline{ab} = \frac{ab}{99}$, the denominator must be a factor of $99 = 3^2 \cdot 11$
The factors of $99$ are $1,$ $3,$ $9,$ $11,$ $33,$ and  $99$
Since $a$ and $b$ are not both nine,  the denominator cannot be $1$
By choosing $a$ and $b$ appropriately,  we can make fractions with each of the other denominators.
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{5}$.
We must have that $p^3+7+3p^2+6+p^2+p+3+p^2+2p+5+6=p^2+4p+2+2p^2+7p+1+3p^2+6p$, meaning that $p^3-p^2-14p+24=0$
But the only prime solutions of this can be factors of $24$, i.e
$2$ and $3$
But $7$ is not a digit in base $2$ or $3$, so there are $\boxed{0}$ possible $p$!
Remark: $2$ and $3$ are, in fact, roots of this polynomial.
Notice that $83^9+1$ and $83^9+83^2+1$ differ by $83^2$
Therefore, if they have a common divisor, then that divisor must also be a divisor of $83^2$
(To see why this is true, suppose $d$ is a divisor of $83^9+1$, so that $83^9+1 = dm$ for some integer $m$; also suppose that $d$ is a divisor of $83^9+83^2+1$, so that $83^9+83^2+1=dn$ for some integer $n$
Then $83^2=d(n-m)$.)
Since $83$ is prime, the only (positive) divisors of $83^2$ are $1$, $83$, and $83^2$ itself
But $83$ cannot be a divisor of $83^9+1$ (which is clearly $1$ more than a multiple of $83$)
Therefore, $\gcd(83^9+1,83^9+83^2+1)=\boxed{1}$.
By the uniqueness of the binary representation of positive integers, there is only one way to represent 1562 as a sum of distinct powers of $2$
To find this representation, we convert 1562 to binary form
The largest power of $2$ less than 1562 is $2^{10}=1024$
The difference between 1024 and 1562 is $538$
The largest power of 2 less than 538 is $2^9=512$
The difference between 538 and 512 is 26
The largest power of 2 less than 26 is $2^4=16$, which leaves us with $26-16=10$
Continuing the process, we get $2^3=8$ and $2^1=2$
So, we have found that $1562=2^{10}+2^9+2^4+2^3+2^1$
The sum of the exponents of 2 in this representation is $\boxed{27}$.
Let $N$ denote the large positive integer that everyone is discussing.
The two incorrect numbers are consecutive numbers
To get the smallest possible value of $N$, we must maximize the incorrect numbers
As such, we should start with the highest possible incorrect numbers and work down.
Suppose the two incorrect numbers are 24 and 25
Then $N$ must still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \dots, 23.$  This means $N$ is divisible by 3 and 8, so $N$ is divisible by $3 \cdot 8 = 24$, contradiction
So the two incorrect numbers cannot be 24 and 25
We can eliminate the other high cases similarly.
One of the incorrect numbers cannot be 22, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 11.
One of the incorrect numbers cannot be 20, because $N$ would still be divisible by 4 and 5.
One of the incorrect numbers cannot be 18, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 9.
On the other hand, suppose the incorrect numbers were 16 and 17
Then $N$ would still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \dots, 15, 18, 19, \dots, 25$
The lcm of these remaining numbers is
\[2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \cdot 19 \cdot 23 = 787386600,\]which is not divisible by 16 or 17
Thus, the incorrect numbers can be 16 and 17, and the smallest possible value of $N$ is $\boxed{787386600}$.
The prime factorization of $120$ is $120 = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$
By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to evaluate all possible remainders of $p^2$ upon division by each of $2^3$, $3$, and $5$
Since $p$ must be odd, it follows that $p = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$
Thus, $(2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4(k)(k+1) + 1$, and since at least one of $k$ and $k+1$ is even, then $$p^2 \equiv 8 \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{8}.$$Since $p$ is not divisible by $3$, then $p = 3l \pm 1$ for some integer $l$, and it follows that $$p^2 \equiv (3k \pm 1)^2 \equiv (\pm 1)^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}.$$Finally, since $p$ is not divisible by $5$, then $p = 5m \pm 1$ or $p = 5m \pm 2$ for some integer $m$
Thus, $$p^2 \equiv (5k \pm 1)^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \text{ or } p^2 \equiv (5k \pm 2)^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{5}.$$We now have two systems of three linear congruences; by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there are exactly $\boxed{2}$ remainders that $p^2$ can leave upon division by $120$
We can actually solve the congruences to find that $p^2 \equiv 1, 49 \pmod{120}$: for $p = 7$, we have $p^2 = 49$, and for $p = 11$, we have $p^2 = 121 \equiv 1 \pmod{120}$.
$$ \text{gcd}(7560, 8400) = 840 = 2^3 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 $$The common divisors of 7560 and 8400 are the divisors of their GCD: $$ t(840) = (3+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = \boxed{32}
When adding the numbers in base $12$, we start by adding the rightmost digits as we do in normal addition
Since $4 + 9$ yields a residue of $1$ upon division by $12$, we write down a $1$ as the rightmost digit of the sum, and carry-over a $1$
The remaining two digits do not yield and carry-overs, so we can add them as normal
Carrying out this addition, we find that:$$ \begin{array}{c@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \stackrel{}{7} & \stackrel{1}{0} & \stackrel{}{4}_{12} \\ &+ & & 1 & 5 & 9_{12} \\ \cline{2-6} && & 8 & 6 & 1_{12} \\ \end{array} .$$Thus, our answer is $\boxed{861_{12}}$.
If Cindy has $n$ coins, then the possible values for $Y$ are the proper factors of $n$ (recall that a proper factor of $n$ is a factor other than 1 or $n$)
Since there are 13 possible values of $Y$, there are $13+2=15$ factors of $n$
Our goal is to find the least value of $n$ with exactly 15 factors
Recall that we can determine the number of positive integer factors of $n$ by prime factorizing $n$, adding 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization, and multiplying the results
The sets of exponents which would give rise to 15 factors are $\{14\}$ and $\{2,4\}$
The least positive integer whose prime factorization has an exponent of 14 is $2^{14}$
The least positive integer whose prime factorization has exponents 2 and 4 is obtained by assigning these exponents in decreasing order to the smallest two primes, which yields $2^4\cdot 3^2=144$
The smaller of these two numbers is 144, so Cindy has $\boxed{144}$ coins.
The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5
The prime factorization of $1400$ is $2^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7$
For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $7$ in the numerator
There are $\left\lfloor\frac{1000}{7}\right\rfloor=142$ multiples of $7$ between $1$ and $1000$, so there are $\boxed{142}$ integers values for $n$.
Since there are 4 band members left over when they line up in rows of 26, we have $20n \equiv 4\pmod{26}$
We divide both sides of the congruence by 4, remembering that we have to divide 26 by the greatest common divisor of 4 and 26
The original congruence is equivalent to \[
5n \equiv 1 \pmod{13}.
\]So we would like to find a multiple of 13 which is one less than a multiple of 5
Noticing that $13\cdot 3$ has a units digit of 9, we identify $(13\cdot 3 + 1)/5 =8$ as the inverse of 5 (mod 13)
Multiplying both sides of our congruence by 8 gives \[
n \equiv 8 \pmod{13}.
\]We have found that $n$ satisfies the conditions given in the problem if $n=8+13k$ for some positive integer $k$ and $20n<1000$
Rewriting the inequality $20n<1000$ as $n<50$, we solve $8+13k < 50$ to find that the maximum solution is $k=\lfloor 42/13\rfloor = 3$
When $k=3$, the number of band members is $20(8+13(3))=\boxed{940}$.
When we are subtracting, we want to subtract a smaller number from a bigger number
We can pull out a negative sign in order to accomplish this:  \[ 35_8-74_8 = -(74_8 - 35_8)
\]Now, we can line in the numbers and subtract just as we do in base 10
For example, when we borrow from the $8^1$s place, the digit 1 in the units place becomes $4+8=12$, while the digit in the $8^1$s place decreases by 1
Continuing in this way, we find $$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& & \cancelto{6}{7} & \cancelto{12}{4}_8 \\
& - & 3 & 5_8 \\
\cline{2-4}
& & 3 & 7_8 \\
\end{array}$$Therefore, $35_8-74_8 = -(74_8 - 35_8) = \boxed{-37_8}$.
When you divide 52 by 8, you get 6 with a remainder of 4
Therefore, 4 of the people will get an extra card, bringing their total to 7, while the remaining $\boxed{4}$ people have only 6 cards.
Let the integer obtained by reversing the digits of $m$ be $n$
$m$ and $n$ are both divisible by $45$, which means that they are both divisible by $5$
Thus, they both have units digits of $5$ or $0$
If one has a units digit of $0$, the other will have a leading digit of $0$, which cannot be
So both end in $5$; reversing them shows that both start with $5$ as well
Since $m$ is divisible by $45$ and by $7$, it is divisible by $7(45)=315$
There are four multiples of $315$ between $5000$ and $6000$: $5040$, $5355$, $5670$, and $5985$
$5985$ is the largest, and it is easy to see that it and its reversal, $5895$, meet all requirements
So $\boxed{5985}$ is the answer.
Instead of adding up the sum and finding the residue, we can find the residue of each number to make computation easier.
Each group of $5$ numbers would have the sum of residues $1+2+3+4+0=10$
Since $10 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$, we can ignore every group of $5$.
This leaves the numbers $121,122,$ and $123$
The sum of the residues is $1+2+3 \equiv 6 \equiv \boxed{1} \pmod{5}$.
If there are $p$ words on each page, then we are given $136p \equiv 184 \pmod{203}$
We can divide both sides of the congruence by 8 since 8 is relatively prime to 203, and this yields $17p \equiv 23 \pmod{203}$
Checking integers which are 1 more than multiples of 203, we find that the modular inverse of 17 modulo 203 is 12
Therefore, $p \equiv 12(23) \equiv 73 \pmod{203}$
Therefore, each page has $\boxed{73}$ words on it.
If the number of marbles in each box is $n$, then $mn = 600$, so $m$ and $n$ are both divisors of 600
$$ 600 = 2^3 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^2 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad t(600) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 24
$$However, $m > 1$ and $n > 1$, so $m$ can be neither 1 nor 600
This leaves $24 - 2 = \boxed{22}$ possible values for $m$.
If the first time was in May, the second time will be 5 months after May, the third time will be $5\cdot2$ months after May, etc
That means the 25th time will be $5\cdot24$ months away
Since the months repeat every 12 months, we look for the remainder when $5\cdot24$ is divided by 12 and add that many months to May
We notice that $\frac{5\cdot24}{12}=5\cdot2$, so it turns out that $5\cdot24$ is a multiple of 12 and leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 12
So the 25th time will be a certain number of years afterward but still in the same month, $\boxed{\text{May}}$.
An integer congruent to 1 (mod 9) can be written in the form $9n + 1$ for some integer $n$
We want to count the number of integers $n$ such that $$ 1 \le 9n + 1 \le 200
$$Subtracting 1 from all parts of the inequality, we get $0 \le 9n \le 199$
Dividing by 9 we get $0 \le n \le 22\, \frac{1}{9}$
There are $22 - 0 + 1 = \boxed{23}$ values of $n$ corresponding to positive integers from 1 to 200 inclusive that are congruent to 1 (mod 9).
$1995=5\cdot399=3\cdot5\cdot133=3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot19$
Since $3\cdot5\cdot7=105$ has three digits, in any expression of $1995$ as the product of two two-digit numbers, $19$ must be a proper factor of one of them
$19\cdot3=57$ and $19\cdot5=95$ are two-digit numbers that are divisible by $19$ and divide $1995$, but $19\cdot7=133$ and $19\cdot3\cdot5=285$ are three digits, so the only possible expressions of $1995$ as the product of two two-digit numbers are $57\cdot35$ and $95\cdot21$
So, there are $\boxed{2}$ such factorizations.
Note that 43 is a close to a multiple of 11, namely 44
Multiplying both sides of the given congruence by 4, we get $44n \equiv 28 \pmod{43}$, which reduces to $n \equiv \boxed{28} \pmod{43}$.
The prime factorization of 50 is $2\cdot5^2$ and the prime factorization of 5005 is $5\cdot7\cdot11\cdot13$
The greatest common divisor is 5 and the least common multiple is $2\cdot5^2\cdot7\cdot11\cdot13=2\cdot5\cdot5005=50050$
The sum of the GCD and LCM is $\boxed{50055}$.
The remainder when a number is divided by 10 is simply the units digit of that number
So we only look for the units digit of the product
With $1734\times 5389$, $4\times9=36$, so the result will have a units digit of 6
Then we multiply 6 by the units digit of $80,607$ and get $6\times7=42$
That means the final product will have a units digit of $\boxed{2}$.
Since 32 is a power of 2, its only factors are the powers of 2 less than or equal to it
These are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32, so there are $\boxed{6}$ positive factors of 32.
Since $6! = 720 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$, the prime factors of $P$ can consist of at most 2's, 3's, and 5's
The least possible number of 2's is two, which occurs when 4 is not visible
The least possible number of 3's is one, which occurs when either 3 or 6 is not visible, and the least number of 5's is zero, when 5 is not visible
Thus $P$ must be divisible by $2^2\cdot3 =
\boxed{12}$, but not necessarily by any larger number.
$99!$, the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, includes the product $2\times5=10$, and since 0 multiplied by any number is 0, the units digit of 99! is $\boxed{0}$.
Simplify $(2+3)^{23}=5^{23}$
Since the ones digit of $5\times5$ is 5, the ones digit of $5^n$ is 5 for any positive integer $n$
Similarly, since the tens digit of $25\times5$ is 2 (and the ones digit is 5), the tens digit of $5^n$ is 2 for all positive integers $n\ge2$
Therefore, the sum of the tens digit and the ones digit of $(2+3)^{23}$ is $2+5=\boxed{7}$.
Let us iterate over larger and larger positive integers for $k$
If $k=1$, then $p^2-k = p^2-1 = (p+1)(p-1)$
Since $p$ is odd, both $p+1$ and $p-1$ are even, so therefore $p^2-1$ is divisible by 4
Also, since $p$ is not divisible by 3, then $p$ must either be one greater or two greater than a multiple of 3, which means that $p-1$ or $p+1$ is divisible by 3, respectively
As a result, $p^2-1$ is divisible by both 3 and 4, so it is divisible by 12
Therefore, we have $\boxed{k = 1}$.
First, since $(2,11)=1$, a number is divisible by $22=2\cdot11$ if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11
$5d5,22e$ is divisible by 2 if and only if $e$ is even ($e$=0, 2, 4, 6, or 8)
Also, $5d5,\!22e$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $(5+5+2)-(d+2+e)=10-(d+e)$ is divisible by 11
Thus, $d+e=10$
We are looking to maximize $d$, so we need to minimize $e$
$e\ne0$ (otherwise $d=10$, which is not a digit)
Thus we take $e=2$, so the maximum value of $d$ is $d=10-2=\boxed{8}$.
Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6
We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49
The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$
We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\boxed{1}$.
We can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$
That means $ak^2=54$
When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$
The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\boxed{1}$.
Adding the three congruences gives \begin{align*}
&6(a+b+c)\equiv 8\pmod 7\\
\implies& -(a+b+c) \equiv 1\pmod 7.
\end{align*}Adding this to each of the congruences yields \begin{align*}
b+2c&\equiv 1\pmod 7,\\
a+2b&\equiv 5\pmod 7,\\
2a+c&\equiv 5\pmod 7.
\end{align*}Substituting $b\equiv 1-2c\pmod 7$ into the second one gives \begin{align*}
&a+2(1-2c)\equiv 5\pmod 7\\
\implies&a-4c\equiv 3\pmod 7\\
\implies&4c-a\equiv 4\pmod 7\\
\implies&8c-2a\equiv 8\pmod 7\\
\implies&c-2a\equiv 1\pmod 7.
\end{align*}Adding this to $2a+c\equiv 5\pmod 7$ results in $2c\equiv 6\pmod 7\implies c\equiv 3\pmod 7$
Finally \begin{align*}
&b\equiv 1-2c\equiv 1-2\cdot 3\equiv 2\pmod 7,\\
&a\equiv 5-2b\equiv 5-2\cdot 2\equiv 1\pmod 7.
\end{align*}Thus, $abc\equiv 1\cdot 2\cdot 3\equiv \boxed{6}$.
When adding the numbers, we notice that $4+4$ leaves a residue of $2$ when divided by $6.$ Thus, the sum will have a rightmost digit of $2,$ and we must carry-over
This yields that $$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \stackrel{1}{} & \stackrel{}{4}_6 \\ &+ & & 1 & 4_6 \\ \cline{2-5} && & 2 & 2_6 \\ \end{array}$$ The sum is therefore $\boxed{22_6}.$
The prime factorization of $24$ is $2^3 \cdot 3$
It follows that the sum of the divisors of $24$ is equal to $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3)(1 + 3)$, as each factor of $24$ is represented when the product is expanded
It follows that the sum of the factors of 24 is $(1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 3) = (15)(4)$, or $\boxed{60}$.
Since $2 \cdot 93 \equiv 186 \equiv 1 \pmod{185}$, $2^{-1} \equiv \boxed{93} \pmod{185}$.
Since $100000 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}$, the integer $n$ we seek is $n = \boxed{5}$.
We have that \begin{align*} 213_{8} &= 2(8^2)+ 1(8^1) +3(8^0) \\
&= 2(64)+1(8)+3(1)\\
&= 128 + 8 + 3\\
&= 139\\
142_{7} &= 1(7^2)+ 4(7^1) +2(7^0) \\
&= 1(49)+4(7)+2(1)\\
&= 49 + 28 + 2\\
\end{align*}So, $213_{8}-142_{7}=139-79=\boxed{60}$.
Let's find the cycle of ones digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1,\ldots$
The cycle of ones digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 7, 9, 3, 1
Thus, to find the ones digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the ones digit 7, $R=2$ corresponds to the ones digit 9, etc.) Since $35\div4=8R3$, the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is $\boxed{3}$.
For 576 to have a final digit of 1 when represented in base $b$, we must have that $576-1$ is divisible by $b$
To see this, note that any integer whose base-$b$ representation ends in 0 is divisible by $b$, just as any integer whose decimal representation ends in 0 is divisible by 10
Since $575 = 5^2 \cdot 23$, the only base which satisfies the given condition is 5
Therefore, there is $\boxed{1}$ such base.
We see that $7882 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$
The only integer $n$ such that $4 \le n \le 8$ and $n \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$ is $n = \boxed{7}$.
By the arithmetic series formula, it follows that $$1_6 + 2_6 + 3_6 + \cdots + 45_6 = \frac{45_6 \times 50_6}{2}$$(notice that this formula remains the same as the base $10$ formula, as the derivation remains the same)
We can ignore the $0$ for now, and evaluate the product $45_6 \times 5_6$ (and append a $0$ at the end)
Evaluating the units digit, we need to multiply $5_6 \times 5_6 = 25_{10} = 41_{6}$
Thus, the next digit is a $1$ and $4$ is carried over
The next digits are given by $4_6 \times 5_6 + 4_6 = 24_{10} = 40_6$
Writing this out:  $$\begin{array}{@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& & & & & \stackrel{4}{4} & \stackrel{}{5}_6 \\
& & & \times & & 5 & 0_6 \\
\cline{4-7} & & & 4 & 0 & 1 & 0_6 \\
\end{array}$$Now, we divide by $2$ to obtain that the answer is $\boxed{2003}_6$
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{2} & 0 & 0 & 3 \\
\cline{2-5}

$$We divide as we do normally; notice that $10_6 \div 2_6 = 3_6$.
We have $$1531_{12} = 12^3 + 5\cdot 12^2 + 3\cdot 12 + 1.$$Note that $12^2$ is divisible by $8$, so $$1531_{12} = (\text{a multiple of 8}) + 3\cdot 12 + 1.$$Therefore, the remainder upon dividing $1531_{12}$ by $8$ is the same as the remainder upon dividing $3\cdot 12+1$ by $8$
This remainder is $\boxed{5}$.
We have  \begin{align*}
abcd &= 1000a + 100b + 10c + d,\text { and }\\
dcba &= 1000d + 100c + 10b + a\end{align*} Adding these gives \begin{align*}
abcd + dcba &= (1000 + 1)d + (100 + 10)c \\
&\qquad + (10 + 100)b + (1 + 1000)a \\
&= 1001(a+d) + 110(b+c).
\end{align*} Furthermore, since $a,b,c,d$ are consecutive, we have $b = a+1$, $c = a+2$, and $d = a+3$, so that $$a+d = 2a + 3 = b+c.$$ Hence, $$abcd + dcba = 1001(2a+3) + 110(2a+3) = 1111(2a+3).$$ It follows that $\boxed{1111}$ must divide any number of the given form
To see that no higher number must divide it, if we take $a = 1$ and $a=2$, we get the numbers $5555$ and $7777$, whose greatest common factor is indeed $1111$.
Recall that, by definition,  $531n \equiv 1067n \pmod{24}$ means that $531n-1067n$ is divisible by 24
In other words,  $$\frac{1067n-531n}{24} = \frac{536n}{24}=\frac{67n}{3}$$must be an integer
Since $67$ and $3$ are relatively prime, $n$ must be a multiple of $3$, the smallest of which is $\boxed{3}$.
We start by changing the expressions to base 10 in terms of $a$ and $b$
We also know that the two expressions should be equal since they represent the same number
\begin{align*}
12_a&=21_b\quad\Rightarrow\\
1\cdot a+2\cdot 1&=2\cdot b +1\cdot1\quad\Rightarrow\\
a+2&=2b+1\quad\Rightarrow\\
a&=2b-1.
\end{align*}For the smallest base-10 integer, we would want the smallest bases $a$ and $b$
Since $a$ and $b$ must be greater than 2, we'll let $b=3$ and that means $a=2\cdot3-1=5$
In these bases, the base-10 integer is $a+2=5+2=\boxed{7}$
We can check that the base-$b$ expression also works and get $2\cdot b+1=2\cdot3+1=7$.
Alternatively, we can just try different bases
The smallest possible value for $a$ and $b$ is 3
If we let $a=3$, we'd need a smaller base for $b$ (since we have $2\cdot b\approx1\cdot a$), which isn't possible
When we let $b=3$, we get $21_3=7$ and try to find $b$ such that $12_b=7$
If $b+2=7$, then $b=5$ and we still get $\boxed{7}$.
Since $\gcd(m,n) = 12$, both $m$ and $n$ are divisible by 12
Then $10m$ is divisible by $10 \cdot 12 = 120$, and $15n$ is divisible by $12 \cdot 15 = 180$
Since 60 divides both 120 and 180, $\gcd(10m,15n)$ must be at least 60.
If we set $m = n = 12$, then $\gcd(m,n) = \gcd(12,12) = 12$, and $\gcd(10m,15n) = \gcd(120,180) = 60$, which shows that the value of 60 is attainable
Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\gcd(10m,15n)$ is $\boxed{60}$.
First, we simplify $1356 \pmod{22}$ to $1356 \equiv 14 \pmod{22}$
Therefore, we have $$3n \equiv 14 \pmod{22}$$This means that $3n$ can be written in the form $22a+14$, where $a$ is an integer
So we have $3n=22a+14$.
We want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\frac{22a+14}{3}=n$ is an integer, which we can easily find to be $1$
Therefore, $n=\frac{22+14}{3}=\boxed{12}$.
First, we need to find $L_{10}$
We find that \begin{align*}L_2 &= L_1 + L_0 = 3,\\ L_3 &= L_2 + L_1 = 4,\\ L_4 &= 7,\\ L_5 &= 11,\\ L_6 &= 18,\\ L_7 &= 29,\\ L_8 &= 47,\\ L_9 &= 76,\\ L_{10} &= 123\end{align*}Thus, $L_{L_{10}} = L_{123}$
To find its units digit, we continue listing more values in the sequence until we reach a pattern: the units digit of $L_{11}$ is that of $123 + 76$, and so is $9$; that of $L_{12}$ is $2$; and that of $L_{13}$ is $1$
Hence, the units digit repeats starting from here, with a period of $12$
As $123 = 12 \times 10 + 3$, then the units digit of $L_{123}$ is the same as that of $L_3$, or $\boxed{4}$.
A prime number is a number whose only divisors are $1$ and itself
If a prime were divisible by $39$, it would have to be divisible by $3$ and $13$ as well since $3$ and $13$ are factors of $39$
Thus the "prime" would have too many factors and wouldn't be a prime! Thus there are $\boxed{0}$ primes which are divisible by $39$.
The largest perfect square less than $555$ is $23^2=529$
Therefore, there are $23$ perfect squares less than $555$.
The largest perfect cube less than $555$ is $8^3=512$
Therefore, there are $8$ perfect cubes less than $555$.
However, we cannot simply add those two numbers together because there are numbers that are both a perfect cube and a perfect square
For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it needs to be a $2 \cdot 3 =6$th power
The largest 6th power less than $555$ is $2^6=64$, so there are $2$ 6th powers less than $555$.
Therefore, there are $23+8-2=\boxed{29}$ integers that are either a perfect cube or perfect square.
First of all, we see that every term has a remainder of $1$ when divided by $6.$ Now, we just need to find how many terms there are
The nth term can be given by the expression $6n - 5.$ Therefore, we set $259 = 6n - 5$ to find $n = 44,$ thus there are $44$ terms in our sum
Thus, the remainder of the sum is the same as the remainder of $44$ when divided by $6,$ which is $\boxed{2}.$
$3^7+6^6 = 3^6\cdot3+3^6\cdot 2^6 = 3^6(3+2^6) = 3^6\cdot 67.$ Thus the greatest prime factor is $\boxed{67}$.
Let $m = 2^{1998} - 1$ and $n = 2^{1989}-1$
Then, $2^9n = 2^9(2^{1989}-1) = 2^{1998} - 2^9 = m - (2^9 - 1)$
By the Euclidean algorithm, it follows that \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,(m,n) &= \text{gcd}\,(n,m-2^9n) \\
&= \text{gcd}\,(n,2^9-1)
\end{align*}Since $9$ divides $1998$, by the difference of odd powers factorization, it follows that $2^{1989}-1$ is divisible by $2^9 - 1$
Thus, the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is $2^9 - 1 = \boxed{511}$.
First, we use the property $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ implies $ac \equiv bc \pmod{m}$.
Since all numbers with units digit $3$ have a remainder of $3$ when divided by $5$ and there are $20$ numbers,  $$3 \times 13 \times 23 \times 33 \times \ldots \times 183 \times 193 \equiv 3^{20} \pmod{5}.$$Next, we also use the property $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \equiv b^c \pmod{m}$.
Since $3^4 \equiv 81 \equiv 1 \pmod5$, and $3^{20} = (3^4)^5$, then $3^{20} \equiv 1^5 \equiv \boxed{1} \pmod{5}$.
Since $a$ has three factors, it is the square of a prime
The smallest such square is $a=2^2=4,$ so we look to find the smallest positive integer $b$ with $4$ factors
The smallest positive integers with four factors are 6 and 8, of which $\boxed{8}$ is divisible by 4
It is easy to check that no smaller value of $b$ would work for a different choice of $a$, because the next smallest square is 9, which is greater than 8.
We can line up the numbers and add just as we do in base 10
For example, in the second column we get $1+6=7$, which we carry just as in base 10 by placing the digit 0 in the sum and carrying 1 to the next column
We get $$
\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& & 1 & 0_7 \\
+ & 1 & 6 & 3_7 \\
\cline{2-4}
& 2 & 0 & 3_7, \\
\end{array}$$so the sum is $\boxed{203_7}$
Subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $8x \equiv 4 \pmod{12}$
Add 12 to the right-hand side to get $8x \equiv 16 \pmod{12}$
Now divide both sides by 8, remembering to divide 12 by the greatest common factor of 12 and 8, thus obtaining $x \equiv 2\pmod{3}$
This gives $a+m = 2 + 3 = \boxed{5}$
Here we have used the fact that $ad \equiv bd\pmod{m}$ if and only if $a\equiv b \pmod{m/\text{gcd}(m,d)}$, for integers $m\geq 2$ and $a$, $b$, and $d$.
We know that $\gcd(m,n) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$
Hence, in this case, the other number is \[\frac{(x + 2) \cdot x(x + 2)}{24} = \frac{x(x + 2)^2}{24}.\]To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.
This expression is not an integer for $x =$ 1, 2, or 3, but when $x = 4$, this expression is $4 \cdot 6^2/24 = 6$.
Note that that the greatest common divisor of 6 and 24 is 6, and $x + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6$
The least common multiple is 24, and $x(x + 2) = 4 \cdot (4 + 2) = 24$, so $x = 4$ is a possible value
Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\boxed{6}$.
If a prime number between 30 and 65 has a prime remainder when divided by 10, it must end in 3 or 7, since any number greater than 10 ending in 2 or 5 is composite
Systemically checking all possibilities, we see that the only such primes are 37, 43, 47, and 53, which gives us a total of $\boxed{4}$ such numbers.
From the Euclidean Algorithm,
\gcd(a_{n}, a_{n+1}) = \gcd(a_n, a_{n+1} - 10a_n).
\]We compute $a_{n+1} - 10a_n = \frac{10^{n+1}-1}{9} - \frac{10^{n+1}-10}{9} = 1$
Therefore, $a_{n+1}$ and $a_n$ share no common factors and $d_n$ is always $\boxed{1}$.
The value of 121 base $n$ is $1\cdot n^2+2\cdot n^1+1\cdot n^0=n^2+2n+1$
Since $n^2+2n+1=(n+1)^2$, the digit string 121 is a perfect square in any base except binary (where the digit 2 is not allowed)
There are $10-3+1=\boxed{8}$ integers between 3 and 10 inclusive.
The single-digit base-$b$ numbers are $$0,1,2,3,\ldots,b-2,b-1.$$We can ignore the $0$
If we pair off the rest of the numbers from either end ($1$ with $b-1$, $2$ with $b-2$, and so on), we get a bunch of pairs that add up to $b$
If $b$ is even, we also get one leftover number in the middle, which must be $\frac b2$.
Thus, the sum of all the single-digit base-$b$ numbers is a multiple of $b$ when $b$ is odd; when $b$ is even, it's a multiple of $b$ plus $\frac b2$
In the first case ($b$ odd), the units digit of the sum (when written in base $b$) is $0$
In the second case ($b$ even), the units digit is $\frac b2$.
Given that Vinny's sum has a units digit of $4$ when written in base $b$, we conclude that $\frac b2=4$, which yields $b=\boxed{8}$.
We can check this answer by summing the single-digit base-$8$ numbers, which are $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7$
Their sum is $28$, which is $34_8$ in base $8$.
Note that  $13^{51}$ is $(10 + 3)^{51}$
Any term in the expansion that involves the 10 will be 0 modulo 5, so it suffices to consider $3^{51} \pmod{5}$
We look for a pattern in powers of 3
\begin{align*}
3^1 &\equiv 3 \pmod{5} \\
3^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{5} \\
3^3 &\equiv 2 \pmod{5} \\
3^4 &\equiv 1 \pmod{5}.
\end{align*}Since $3^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5},$ we see that $3^{51} \equiv 3^3 \cdot (3^4)^{12} \equiv 2 \pmod{5},$ hence our desired remainder is $\boxed{2}.$
Any $4$ consecutive integers will have at least one multiple of $3,$ an even number not divisible by $4,$ and a multiple of $4.$ Therefore the product of any $4$ consecutive integers must be divisible by $2\cdot 3\cdot 4=\boxed{24}.$
We can check that no larger number divides every product of four consecutive integers by considering $1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4=24$.
Let $a$ be a common term
We know that \begin{align*}
a&\equiv 2\pmod 3\\
a&\equiv 3\pmod 7
\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer such that $a=2+3n$
Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \[2+3n\equiv 3\pmod 7\implies n\equiv 5\pmod 7\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $5$
Then $n\ge 5\implies a=2+3n\ge 17$
$17$ satisfies the original congruences, so it is the smallest common term
Subtracting $17$ from both sides of both congruences gives \begin{align*}
a-17&\equiv -15\equiv 0\pmod 3\nonumber\\
a-17&\equiv -14\equiv 0\pmod 7\nonumber
\end{align*} Since $\gcd(3,7)$, we get $a-17\equiv 0\pmod{3\cdot 7}$, that is, $a\equiv 17\pmod{21}$.
So all common terms must be of the form $17+21m$ for some non-negative integer $m$
Note that any number of the form also satisfies the original congruences
The largest such number less than $500$ is $17+21\cdot 22=\boxed{479}$.
To express the number $0.42\overline{153}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $1000x$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&1000x &=& 421&.53153153153\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.42153153153\ldots \\
\hline
&999x &=& 421&.11
\end{array}$$This shows that $0.42\overline{153} = \frac{421.11}{999} = \frac{42111}{99900}$.
So, $x=\boxed{42111}$.
By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors
Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$
Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\cdot p_2^6\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\boxed{315}$ positive factors.
Since $256=2^8$ the divisors of $256$ are the powers of 2 up to $2^8$
So the sum of the proper factors of 256 is $2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5+2^6+2^7=\boxed{255}$.
The only multiple of 7 that is prime is 7
Any other multiple of 7 has at least three positive divisors: 1, 7, and itself
Therefore, the probability that the selected number is both prime and a multiple of 7 is $\boxed{\frac{1}{50}}$.
Note that 2004 is divisible by 4, since the last two digits, 04, form a multiple of 4
Also, 2004 is divisible by 3 since the sum of the digits, $2+0+0+4=6$, is a multiple of 3
Therefore, 2004 is a multiple of 12, and 2004 hours from now it will be $\boxed{9}$ o'clock again.
The least common multiple of these integers is $4\cdot3\cdot5=60$
Thus, a positive integer that is one more than a multiple of all the given integers is $60+1=\boxed{61}$.
The decimal representation of 1/7 is $0.\overline{142857}$
Since 96 is a multiple of 6, the 96th digit after the decimal point is 7, the digit at the end of the repeating block
The digit four places later is $\boxed{8}$.
Let $n$ be the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube
In order for a number to be a perfect cube and a perfect square, it must be a perfect sixth power
Now we choose the smallest $a$ such that $n$ is four-digit: $2^6=64$, $3^6=729$, $4^6=4096$
Thus, $n=\boxed{4096}$.
Prime factorize $48=2^4\cdot3$
The sum of the the positive factors of 48 is $1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4+3+2\cdot3+2^2\cdot3+2^3\cdot3+2^4\cdot3=\boxed{124}$
Note that this also could be obtained from multiplying $(2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4)(3^0+3^1)=(31)(4)$, since expanding the left-hand side of this equation yields the left-hand side of the previous equation.
Notice that $n^3 - n$ factors as $n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = (n-1)n(n+1)$
We observe that among any three consecutive integers, at least one must be divisible by $2$ and one must be divisible by $3$
Thus, we know that $6$ must always divide into $n^3 - n$
Indeed, this is the largest such integer; for $n = 6$, then $n^3 - n = 210 = 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$, and for $n = 33$, then $n^3 - n = 32 \cdot 33 \cdot 34 = 6 \cdot 32 \cdot 11 \cdot 17$, whose greatest common divisor is $\boxed{6}$.
$2847_9=2\cdot9^3+8\cdot9^2+4\cdot9^1+7\cdot9^0=1458+648+36+7=\boxed{2149}$ miles.
Note that $20m = \underbrace{444444440}_{\text{9 digits}}$, so $n = 20m+4$.
If $d$ is any common divisor of $m$ and $n$, then $d$ must also be a divisor of $n-20m = 4$
Therefore, $\gcd(m,n)$ is either $1$, $2$, or $4$
We can see that $m$ is not divisible by $4$ (since its last two digits form $22$, which is not a multiple of $4$)
However, both $m$ and $n$ are clearly divisible by $2$, so $\gcd(m,n)=\boxed{2}$.
Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\ldots$
The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6
To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6
Therefore, the units digit of $F_n=2^{2^{1000}}+1$ is $6+1=\boxed{7}$.
Note that it is possible that $a = 1$ and $b = 2$, since $3\cdot 2 = 8 - 2 \cdot 1$
Then $2b + 12 = 16$
Since $3,$ $5,$ and $6,$ are not factors of $16$, it is not true that these numbers must be divisors of $2b + 12.$
It only remains to check whether $1$, $2$, and $4$ must be divisors of $2b + 12$
The distributive property gives us   $$8 - 2a = 2 \cdot 4 - 2a = 2(4 -a),$$so $2$ is a factor of $3b$
Note that   $$b = 3b - 2b,$$so since $2$ is a factor of $3b$ and $2$ is a factor of $2b,$ $2$ must be a factor of $b.$ So we can say $b = 2n$ for some integer $n$
Substituting gives us    \begin{align*}
2b + 12 &= 2(2n) + 12\\
&= 4n + 4 \cdot 3\\
&= 4(n + 3),
\end{align*}so $4$ is a factor of $2b + 12$
Since $1,$ $2,$ and $4$ are factors of $4$ and $4$ is a factor of $2b + 12$, it must be true that $1,$ $2,$ and $4$ are factors of $2b + 12$
So our final answer is $\boxed{3}.$
You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $1000!$
Since $10=2\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are
We're going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.
To count how many times a number is divisible by $5$, we divide $1000$ by $5$ to get $200$
Each of those two hundred numbers has a factor of $5$.
Next, how many of the numbers are divisible by $5^2=25$? Dividing $1000$ by $25$, we get $40$
Each of them has two factors of $5$
We've already counted one of them for each number, so for these forty multiples of $25$, we need to add a factor for each to our count.
Next, we need to look at numbers that have $5^3=125$ in them
Eight of our numbers are divisible by $125$, so we count $8$ more factors of $5$.
Finally, we look at $5^4=625$
There is only one number among $1$ through $1000$ divisible by $625$, and that number is $625$, so we only need to count one more factor of $5$
Since $5^5$ is too big, we can stop here.
This gives a total of $200+40+8+1=249$ factors of $5$ in $1000!$, so it has $\boxed{249}$ zeroes on the end.
The second condition tells us that the integer must be between $25^2 = 625$ and $(25.3)^2 \approx 640$
The only multiple of 14 in this range is $\boxed{630}.$  (One easy way to find a multiple of 14 is to find a number that is both a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 7.)
Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5
Prime factorizing 350 as $2\cdot 5^2\cdot 7$, we see that $n/350$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 7
There are 49 multiples of 7 from 1 to 349, so there are $\boxed{49}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\frac{n}{350}$ a terminating decimal.
Notice that we can pair many of these terms: \[1+7=2+6=3+5=8,\]so the remainder we want is the same as the remainder when $4+9+10$ is divided by 8
We also see that this is the remainder when  \[4+1+2=7\]is divided by 8, so the answer is $\boxed{7}$.
There are 2 different ways in which Megan can type the first three numbers
There are $4! = 24$ different orderings of the digits 0, 1, 6 and 7 for the last four digits
So, there are $2 \cdot 24 = 48$ different numbers she can dial
Since exactly one number will be Fatima's, there is a $\boxed{\frac{1}{48}}$ probability of Megan guessing it right.
If the perimeter of the square is $32$ feet, then the length of each side is $\frac{32}{4}=8$ feet
That makes the area of the square $8^2=\boxed{64}$ square feet.
Since the rectangle has width $w$, length 8, and perimeter 24, then $2w+2(8)=24$ or $2w+16=24$ or $2w=8$ or $w=4$
Therefore, the ratio of the width to the length is $4 : 8 = \boxed{1 : 2}$.
It is not possible for all 107 to exceed the mean since the mean is always greater than or equal to the smallest element
However 106 of the students can exceed the mean
For example, if 106 students get a 5 and the other student gets a 4, the mean is slightly less than 5 and all $\boxed{106}$ of the students that scored 5 will exceed the mean.
Adding 2 to each member of the list, we get $$3, 6, 9, \ldots, 2007, 2010,$$ and then dividing each member of the list by 3, we get $$1,2,3,\ldots,669,670,$$ so there are $\boxed{670}$ numbers.

Because $\overline{AB}\parallel\overline{CD}$, we have $\angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ$
Since $\angle B = 3\angle C$, we have $3\angle C + \angle C = 180^\circ$, so $4\angle C = 180^\circ$ and $\angle C = 45^\circ$
Since $\overline{AD}\parallel\overline{BC}$, we have $\angle C +\angle D = 180^\circ$, so $\angle D = 180^\circ - \angle C = \boxed{135^\circ}$.
The third side is either the hypotenuse of the right triangle or one of the legs
It is shorter in the latter case, because the angle between the sides of length 5 and 12 is smaller
By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the missing leg is $\sqrt{12^2-5^2}=\boxed{\sqrt{119}}$ units
(Note: $\sqrt{119}$ does not simplify since $119 = 7\cdot 17$).
Four hours after starting, Alberto has gone about 60 miles and Bjorn has gone about 45 miles
Therefore, Alberto has biked about $\boxed{15}$ more miles.
In general, to express the number $0.\overline{n}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&10x &=& n&.nnnnn\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.nnnnn\ldots \\
\hline
&9x &=& n &
\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\overline{n} = \frac{n}{9}$.
Hence, our original problem reduces to computing $\frac 39 + \frac 29 = \boxed{\frac 59}$.
His South American stamps issued before the $70\text{'s}$ include $4+7=11$ from Brazil that cost $11 \times \$ 0.06 = \$ 0.66$ and $6+4=10$ from Peru that cost $10 \times \$0.04 = \$0.40.$ Their total cost is $ \$ 0.66 + \$ 0.40 = \boxed{\$ 1.06}.$
We can answer this question with a Venn diagram
First we know that the intersection of ``kinda pink'' and ``purply'' contains 27 people
We also know that 17 people fall outside both circles
label("kinda pink", (2,75));
label("purply", (80,75));
draw(Circle((30,45), 22));
draw(Circle((58, 45), 22));
label(scale(0.8)*"$27$", (44, 45));
//label(scale(0.8)*"$4$",(28,45));
//label(scale(0.8)*"$43$",(63,45));
label(scale(0.8)*"$17$", (70, 15));
[/asy] Since the ``kinda pink'' circle must contain 60 people total, $60-27=33$ people must believe fuchsia is ``kinda pink,'' but not ``purply.'' [asy]
label("kinda pink", (2,75));
label("purply", (80,75));

label(scale(0.8)*"$17$", (70, 15));
[/asy] Of the 100 people, $27+33+17=77$ people are accounted for, so the remaining 23 people must believe that fuchsia is ``purply'' but not ``kinda pink.''   [asy]

[/asy] The total number of people who think fuchsia is ``purply'' is $27+23=\boxed{50}$.
There are six possible numbers for the spinner to land on, three of which are prime (3, 2, and 5)
Thus, the probability of spinning a prime number is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
Let $r$ be the radius of the circle
The given tells us that $2\cdot2\pi r=\pi r^2$
Dividing by $\pi r$, we have $r=\boxed{4}$ inches.
The prime factors of 12 are 2, 2, and 3
If the greatest common factor with 12 is 4, that means the other number is a multiple of 4 but not 6, 12
Since the other number must an even number (multiple of 2), we start with 98 and look at decreasing even numbers
98 is not a multiple of 4
96 is a multiple of 6 and 12
94 is not a multiple of 4
So, the greatest integer less than 100 that satisfies the conditions is $\boxed{92}$.
Suppose that the rectangle's length is $4l$, then it's width is $3l$
Then its perimeter is $14l = 56$, meaning that $l = 4$
Finally, the rectangle's diagonal is $\sqrt{(4l)^2 + (3l)^2} = 5l = \boxed{20}$.
Since $x$ is negative, the median of the set is 14
Therefore, the mean of the set is $14+5=19$, and its sum is $19\cdot 5=95$
Since 12, 38, 45, and 14 sum to 109, the remaining integer $x$ must be $95-109=\boxed{-14}$.
Substituting the given values, we need to calculate, $\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{2} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{-3}$
Because $n^{ab} = \left(n^{a}\right)^{b}$, this expression is equivalent to $$\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{2} \left(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{-1}\right)^{3} = \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{2} \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{3}.$$Because $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{n} = \frac{a^{n}}{b^{n}}$, we can rewrite this as $$\frac{3^{2}}{5^{2}} \cdot \frac{3^{3}}{2^{3}} = \frac{3^{2} \cdot 3^{3}}{5^{2} \cdot 2^{3}}.$$We then have \[\frac{3^{2} \cdot 3^{3}}{5^{2} \cdot 2^{3}} = \frac{9\cdot 27}{25\cdot 8} = \boxed{\frac{243}{200}}.\]
Since $\angle PQS$ is an exterior angle of $\triangle QRS$, then $\angle PQS=\angle QRS+\angle QSR$, so $136^\circ = x^\circ + 64^\circ$ or $x = 136-64=\boxed{72}$.
We write out the first few numbers with a units digit of 7: \[7, 17, 27, 37, 47, 57, 67, 77, 87, 97, 107, 117\] Note how 7 and 17 are prime, but 27 (9 times 3) is not
37 and 47 are prime, but 57 (3 times 19) is not
67 is prime, but 77 (7 times 11) is not
87 has a units sum of 15 which is divisible by 3, so 87 itself is divisible by 3 and thus is not prime
97 and 107 are prime
By now, we have found our desired first seven prime numbers
Their sum is  \begin{align*}
7 &+ 17 + 37 + 47 + 67 + 97 + 107 \\
&= 7+7+7+7+7+7+7 + 10 + 30 + 40 + 60 + 90 + 100 \\
&= 7(7) + 10(1+3+4+6+9+10) \\
&= 49 + 10(33)=\boxed{379}.
\end{align*}
If we sort the numbers, we get $2,4,5,6,7,8$
If we want to maximize the median, we should add three numbers larger than 8
This makes the median $\boxed{7}$.
We assess the statements one at a time.
If $a$ is a multiple of 4, then $a=4m$ for some integer $m$
In particular, $a$ can be written as $2\cdot(2m)$ and therefore is even (recall that being a multiple of 2 is the same as being even)
Similarly, $b$ is eight times $n$ for some integer $n$, which means that $b=2\cdot(4n)$ is also even
Finally, the sum of two even numbers is even
So statement A is true.
We are told that $a$ is a multiple of 4
Also, $b$ is eight times $n$ for some integer $n$, which means that $b=4\cdot(2n)$ is also a multiple of 4
Since the sum of two multiples of 4 is again a multiple of 4, we see that $a+b$ is a multiple of 4
So statement B is true.
If we take $a=12$ and $b=8$, we see that $a+b=20$ is not a multiple of 8
Thus statement C is false.
If we take $a=16$ and $b=16$, then $a+b=32$ is a multiple of 8
So statement D is false.
So, the true statements are $\boxed{\text{A,B}}$.
For every 3 white balls in the jar, there are 2 red balls in the jar
Since there are 9 white balls in the jar, which is 3 groups of 3 white balls, there must be 3 groups of 2 red balls in the jar
Thus, there are $3\times2 =\boxed{6}$ red balls in the jar.
We have  \[9\cdot \frac{1}{13}\cdot 26 = 9\cdot \frac{26}{13} = 9\cdot (26\div 13) = 9\cdot 2 = \boxed{18}.\]
By definition, if $a$ is nonzero, then $a^{-3}$ is the reciprocal of $a^3$
So, $\left(\frac78\right)^3$ and $\left(\frac78\right)^{-3}$ are reciprocals
Therefore, their product is $\boxed{1}$.
The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is at most $9+9=18.$ This means the only possible perfect square sums are $1,$ $4,$ $9,$ and $16.$ Each square has the following two-digit possibilities:
$\bullet$ $1:$ $10$
$\bullet$ $4:$ $40,$ $31,$ $22,$ $13$
$\bullet$ $9:$ $90,$ $81,$ $72,$ $63,$ $54,$ $45,$ $36,$ $27,$ $18$
$\bullet$ $16:$ $97,$ $88,$ $79$
There are $\boxed{17}$ two-digit numbers in all.
$91 = 7^1 \cdot 13^1$ and $72 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2$, so gcd(91, 72) = $\boxed{1}$.
We divide each number in the sum by $32$ to get the following equalities:   \begin{align*}
64 &= 32 \cdot 2\\
96 &= 32 \cdot 3\\
128 &= 32 \cdot 4\\
160 &= 32 \cdot 5\\
288 &= 32 \cdot 9\\
352 &= 32 \cdot 11\\
3232 &= 32 \cdot 101.
\end{align*} These equations tell us that each of the numbers in the sum is a multiple of $32$
A sum of multiples of $32$ is a multiple of $32$, so $x$ is a multiple of $32$
It follows that D is true.
Recall that, for integers $x$, $y$, and $z$, if $x$ is a factor of $y$ and $y$ is a factor of $z$, then $x$ is a factor of $z$
Note that      $$32 = 4 \cdot 8 = 16 \cdot 2,$$ so $4$, $8$, and $16$ are factors of $32$
We already showed $32$ is a factor of $x$, so $4$, $8$, and $16$ must also be factors of $x$
It follows that statements A, B, and C are also true.
We have shown that all the statements are true, so our final answer is $\boxed{\text{A,B,C,D}}$.
The sum of the measures of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180^\circ(n-2)$
Therefore,  \[
180(n-2)=1800 \implies n=12.
\] So $n+2=14$, and the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a 14-gon is $180^\circ(14-2)=\boxed{2160}$ degrees.
The potential square factors are $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, $36$, and $49$
$4$ divides $12$ of the numbers
$9$ divides $5$ of the numbers, but we've counted $4 \cdot 9 = 36$ twice, so we subtract $1$
$16$ divides $3$ of the numbers, but each of those is also divisible by $4$, so we don't count them
$25$ divides $2$
$36$ divides $1$, itself, but it's already been counted
Finally, $49$ divides $1$
Thus, our final answer is $12 + (5-1) + 2 + 1 = \boxed{19}$.
Writing each temperature as 80 degrees plus or minus some number of degrees, the sum of the temperatures is  \begin{align*}
80+79&+81+85+87+89+87 \\&= 80 +(80-1) + (80+1) + (80+5) \\
&\qquad+ (80+7)+(80+9)+(80+7)\\
&=7\cdot 80 + (-1+1+5+7+9+7)\\
&=7\cdot 80 + 28.
\end{align*} So, the mean of the 7 temperatures is  \[\frac{7\cdot 80 + 28}{7} = \frac{7\cdot 80}{7} + \frac{28}{7} = \boxed{84}.\]
Since square $A$ has a perimeter of 24 cm and all its sides are equal in length, each side measures $24/4=6$ cm
The area of square $A$ is thus $6\cdot6=36$ square cm
Thus, the area of square $B$ is $36/4=9$ square cm
So each side of square $B$ measures $\sqrt{9}=3$ cm
Finally, the perimeter of square $B$ is $4\cdot3=\boxed{12}$ cm.
The area of a circle with radius $r$ is $\pi r^2.$
So the area of the larger circle is $\pi(10^2)=100\pi$ and the area of the smaller circle is $\pi(6^2)=36\pi.$
The area of the ring between the two circles is the difference of these two areas.
Therefore, the area of the ring is $100\pi - 36\pi = \boxed{64\pi}.$
Since there were a total of $130$ people surveyed who listen to this station and we know that $62$ of them are male, $130-62=\boxed{68}$ of the females surveyed said that they listen to this station.
There are $6^3=216$ equally likely possibilities for the result of a roll of three dice
We count the number of results which give a sum of 9
If the three rolls are all the same, then (3,3,3) is the only possibility
If two of the three rolls are the same, then (2,2,5) and (4,4,1) along with their permutations (2,5,2), (5,2,2), (4,1,4), and (1,4,4) are the only possibilities
If the three rolls are distinct, then (1,2,6), (1,3,5), and (2,3,4) along with their permutations are the only possibilities
Since there are $3!=6$ ways to arrange three distinct numbers, each of the rolls (1,2,6), (1,3,5), and (2,3,4) has 6 permutations
Altogether, there are $1+6+3\cdot 6=25$ rolls which have a sum of 9
Therefore, the probability of obtaining a sum of 9 is $\boxed{\frac{25}{216}}$.
18 has 3 possible factorizations into pairs: $(1,18)$, $(2,9)$, and $(3,6)$
Only one of these, $(3,6)$, has difference 3, and it has sum $3+6=\boxed{9}$.
Let the number of raisins Bryce received be $x$
Since Bryce received 6 more raisins than Carter, Carter received $x-6$ raisins
Since Carter received half the number of raisins Bryce did, Carter also received $x/2$ raisins
We have two ways of expressing the number of raisins Carter received, so we have the equation $x-6=x/2$, or $x=12$
Thus, Bryce received $\boxed{12}$ raisins.
There are 3 choices for the first digit and 2 for the second, for a total of $3\cdot2=\boxed{6}$ integers possible.

In order to find $x$, we consider the three red lines
Since $k$ and $\ell$ are parallel, we determine that we have the  pair of corresponding angles below:

This angle is the supplement of $x$, so the measure of $x$ is  \[180^\circ-30^\circ=\boxed{150^\circ}.\]
First we simplify the left side, which gives $16 = 2+r$
Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us $r=\boxed{14}$.
First we find the prime factorization of each number: $$100=10\times 10=(2\times 5)\times(2\times 5)=2^2\times 5^2$$ and $$120=10\times 12=(2\times 5)\times(2\times 6)=(2\times 5)\times(2\times(2\times 3))=2^3\times 3\times 5.$$ The common factors are $2^2$ and $5,$ so $\gcd(100,120) = 2^2\times 5=20.$
The least common multiple is formed by multiplying together the highest powers of all primes occurring in the factorization of either $100$ or $120:$ $$\text{lcm}(100,120) = 2^3\times 3\times 5^2 = 8\times 3\times 25 = 24\times 25 = 600.$$ Thus, the product of the $\gcd$ and the $\text{lcm}$ is $20\times 600=\boxed{12000}.$
(Notice that this product is equal to the product of the original two numbers, $100$ and $120.$ Is that just a coincidence?)
The measure of each interior angle in a regular $n$-gon is $180(n-2)/n$ degrees
Therefore, the measure of angle $\angle BAD$ is $180(7-2)/7=\frac{900}7$ degrees and the measure of angle $CAD$ is 90 degrees
The angle, $\angle BAC$, therefore can be expressed as: \[360^\circ - \frac{900}{7}^\circ - 90^\circ = 270^\circ - \frac{900}{7}^\circ = \frac{1890 - 900}{7}^\circ = \boxed{\frac{990}{7}^\circ}.\]
Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs
The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$
However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$
Thus, there are $\frac{10 \cdot 9}{2} = \boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.
When solving this problem, we must remember to apply the order of operations
First, we perform all cases of multiplication and division from left to right to obtain
\begin{align*}
1+6\cdot2-3+5\cdot4\div2&=1+12-3+5\cdot4\div2\\
&=1+12-3+20\div 2\\
&=1+12-3+10.
\end{align*}Next, we perform all the required additions and subtractions from left to right
We get  \begin{align*}
1+12-3+10&=13-3+10\\
&=10+10\\
&=\boxed{20}.
\end{align*}
The area of a triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(\text{base})(\text{height})$, so the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2}(8\text{ cm})(\text{10 cm})=\boxed{40}$ square centimeters.
The order of operations says that we must do the multiplication before we do the addition
We get \begin{align*}3\cdot 9&=27,\end{align*}\begin{align*}4\cdot 10&=40,\end{align*}\begin{align*}11\cdot 3=33,\end{align*}and \begin{align*}3\cdot 8&=24.\end{align*}Now, substituting back into the original equation and using the properties of addition we get \begin{align*}3\cdot 9+4\cdot 10+11\cdot 3+3\cdot 8&=27+40+33+24 \\ &=27+33+40+24 \\ &=60+40+24 \\ &=100+24 \\ &=\boxed{124}.\end{align*}
Since the side of the shaded square is a diagonal of the smaller squares, it has area $(\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$ square units
The whole grid has area $4^2 = 16$ units, so the ratio of areas is $\frac{2}{16} =\boxed{\frac 18}$.
We begin this problem by summing $0.\overline{1}$, $0.\overline{01}$, and $0.\overline{0001}$ as decimals
We do this by realizing that $0.\overline{1}$ can also be written as $0.\overline{1111}$ and that $0.\overline{01}$ can be written as $0.\overline{0101}$
Thus, $0.\overline{1}+0.\overline{01}+0.\overline{0001}=0.\overline{1111}+0.\overline{0101}+0.\overline{0001}=0.\overline{1213}$
(Since there is no carrying involved, we can add each decimal place with no problems.)
To express the number $0.\overline{1213}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10000x$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&10000x &=& 1213&.12131213\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.12131213\ldots \\
\hline
&9999x &=& 1213 &
\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\overline{1213} = \boxed{\frac{1213}{9999}}$.
(Note: We have to check that this answer is in lowest terms
The prime factorization of $9999$ is $3^2\cdot 11\cdot 101$, so we must check that $1213$ is not divisible by $3$, $11$, or $101$.
Since $1+2+1+3=7$ is not a multiple of $3$, neither is $1213$
Also, $1213 = 11^2\cdot 10 + 3 = 101\cdot 12 + 1$, so $1213$ can't be a multiple of $11$ or $101$.)
Because 3967149.1587234 is between 3967149 and 3967150, rounding will give us either 3967149 or 3967150
Since 0.1587234 is less than 0.5, we get that 3967149.1587234 is closer to $\boxed{3967149}$.
Taking the prime factorization of 990, we get $2\cdot3^2\cdot5\cdot11$
So, our answer is $11+2=\boxed{13}$.
We have that in every recipe, there is 1 part butter to 6 parts flour to 4 parts sugar
That is identical to saying that there are $2 \cdot 1 = 2$ parts butter to $2 \cdot 6 = 12$ parts flour to $2 \cdot 4 = 8$ parts sugar
If each part is a cup, then there must be 12 cups flour and 2 cups butter used
In total, there are $12+2+8=\boxed{22}$ total cups of ingredients used.
Recall that $(-a)^n=-a^n$ when $n$ is odd
Because 47 is odd, $(-1)^{47}=-1^{47}=-1$
Evaluating the remaining exponents, we get \begin{align*}
(-1)^{47} + 2^{(3^3+4^2-6^2)}&= -1 + 2^{(3^3+4^2-6^2)} \\
&=-1 + 2^{(27+16-36)} \\
&=-1 + 2^{(43-36)} \\
&=-1 + 2^{7} \\
&=-1+128 \\
&=\boxed{127}
\end{align*}
She baked 36 pies
Of these

$\frac23\cdot36=24$ contained marshmallows
$\frac34\cdot36=27$ contained cayenne
$\frac16\cdot36=6$  contained salted soy nuts.
At most 9 pies do not contain cayenne
It is possible, however that all of the chocolate, marshmallow, and salted soy nut pies are among the other 27 pies, so there could be at most $\boxed{9}$ pies without any of these ingredients.
Combining the $x$ terms, we have $100x+x=100x+1x=101x$
Combining the constant terms, we have $15+15=30$
Thus our simplified expression is $\boxed{101x+30}$.
Since $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^j \cdot \left(\frac{c}{d}\right)^j = \left(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}\right)^{j}$, we know  $\left(\frac{6}{7}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{6 \cdot 1}{7 \cdot 2}\right)^2$
Simplifying, we have $\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^2 = \frac{3^2}{7^2}$, because $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$
We know $3^2 = 9$ and $7^2 = 49$, so our answer is $\boxed{\frac{9}{49}}$.
After the picture is enlarged by tripling its dimensions, the dimensions become $12\times18$
After the border is added, the dimensions of the picture increase to $16\times22$ (since each side has a 2-inch border)
The perimeter is $16+16+22+22=76$ inches
Since $76/12=6\frac{1}{3}$, we need $\boxed{7}$ feet of framing to go around the entire picture.
Calculating, $(5^2 - 4^2)^3 = (25-16)^3 = 9^3 = \boxed{729}$.
If a number is divisible by 4, then it is divisible by 2, which means that its last digit must be even
The numbers 20, 12, 24, 16, and 28 show that any even digit is possible, so the number of possible last digits is $\boxed{5}$.
Since the exam grade is the percentage of words I recall correctly, we can set up a proportion to find the minimum number of words I need to learn: \begin{align*}
\frac{\text{number of words I need to learn}}{\text{total words}}&=\frac{85\%}{100\%}\\
\frac{x}{500}&=\frac{85}{100}\\
x&=\frac{85}{100}\cdot 500\\
x&=85\cdot 5\\
x&=\boxed{425}.
\end{align*}Learning 425 words will lead to a score of exactly $85\%$, so I do not need to learn any more words than 425.
Recall that expressions within parentheses should be done first
In the inner set of parentheses, we have $6+1-4=3.$ So, the outer set of parentheses can be rewritten as $21\div3=7.$ Finally, \[(21 \div (6 + 1 - 4)) \cdot 5=7\cdot5=\boxed{35}.\]
Let the amount of money Billy invested in bonds be $s.$ Then, the amount of money he invested in stocks is $4.5s.$ The total amount of money he invested is $s+4.5s=5.5s=165,\!000.$ Thus, $s=\frac{165,\!000}{5.5}=30,\!000.$ Finally, the amount invested in stocks is $4.5s=4.5\cdot30,\!000=\boxed{135,\!000}$ dollars.
Let $x$ be the number of minutes that Bob anticipates using
Plan A costs $10x$ cents, while Plan B costs $2000 + 5x$ cents
We therefore have the inequality \begin{align*}
2000+5x &< 10x \\
\Rightarrow\qquad 2000 &< 5x \\
\Rightarrow\qquad 400 &< x.
\end{align*} The smallest integer $x$ such that $400 < x$ is $401$
Therefore, Bob must use at least $\boxed{401}$ minutes to make Plan B cheaper.
Rachel drinks $\frac{2}{3}$ of Don's $\frac{1}{5}$ of a gallon of milk
The word "of" means multiply, so Rachel drinks $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{5}$ gallons of milk
Multiplying, we get $\frac{(2)(1)}{(3)(5)}=\boxed{\frac{2}{15}}$ gallons.
After Kim receives a 90 on her fourth exam, the average changes from $\dfrac{87+83+88}{3} = 86$ to $\dfrac{87+83+88+90}{4} = 87$, an increase of $\boxed{1}$.
The $\text L$-shaped region is made up of two rectangles with area $3\times 1=3$ plus the corner square with area $1\times 1=1,$ so the area of the $\text L$-shaped figure is $2\times 3+1=\boxed{7}.$
$\text{Square }FECG-\text{Square }FHIJ=4\times 4-3\times 3 =16-9=\boxed{7}.$
The $\text L$-shaped region can be decomposed into a $4\times 1$ rectangle and a $3\times 1$ rectangle
So the total area is $\boxed{7}.$
Since $\angle ABC + \angle ABD = 180^\circ$ (in other words, $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ABD$ are supplementary) and $\angle ABD = 130^\circ$, then $\angle ABC = 50^\circ$

[/asy] Since the sum of the angles in triangle $ABC$ is $180^\circ$ and we know two angles $93^\circ$ and $50^\circ$ which add to $143^\circ$, then $\angle ACB = 180^\circ - 143^\circ = \boxed{37^\circ}$.
Since Steven owes $\frac{11}{2}$ for each of the $\frac73$ rooms, he owes $\frac{11}{2}\cdot \frac73 = \frac{11\cdot 7}{2\cdot 3} = \boxed{\frac{77}{6}}$ dollars.
To begin with, note that all the numbers in question have a 1 in the hundreds place, and every number is divisible by 1, so we do not need to check it
So we need to see under what circumstances the number is divisible by its tens and units digits.
Let the three-digit number be $\overline{1TU}.$  We can then divide into cases, based on the digit $T.$
Case 1: $T = 0$.
We are looking for three-digit numbers of the form $\overline{10U}$ that are divisible by $U,$ or where $U = 0.$  If $\overline{10U}$ is divisible by $U,$ then 100 is divisible by $U.$   Thus, the possible values of $U$ are 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5.
Case 2: $T = 1$.
We are looking for three-digit numbers of the form $\overline{11U}$ that are divisible by $U,$ or where $U = 0.$  If $\overline{11U}$ is divisible by $U,$ then 110 is divisible by $U.$   Thus, the possible values of $U$ are 0, 1, 2, and 5.
Case 3: $T = 2$.
We are looking for three-digit numbers of the form $\overline{12U}$ that are divisible by $U,$ or where $U = 0.$  If $\overline{12U}$ is divisible by $U,$ then 120 is divisible by $U.$   Also, $\overline{12U}$ must be divisible by 2, which means $U$ is even
Thus, the possible values of $U$ are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
Case 4: $T = 3$.
We are looking for three-digit numbers of the form $\overline{13U}$ that are divisible by $U,$ or where $U = 0.$  If $\overline{13U}$ is divisible by $U,$ then 130 is divisible by $U.$   Also, $\overline{13U}$ must be divisible by 3
Thus, the possible values of $U$ are 2 and 5.
Case 5: $T = 4$.
We are looking for three-digit numbers of the form $\overline{14U}$ that are divisible by $U,$ or where $U = 0.$  If $\overline{14U}$ is divisible by $U,$ then 140 is divisible by $U.$   Also, $\overline{14U}$ must be divisible by 4
Thus, the possible values of $U$ are 0 and 4.
Case 6: $T = 5$.
Since the three-digit number must be between 100 and 150, the only number in this case is 150.
Adding up the possibilities gives us $\boxed{19}$ possible three-digit numbers.
$\begin{matrix}
100 & 101 & 102 & & 104 & 105 \\
110 & 111 & 112 & & & 115 \\
120 & & 122 & & 124 & & 126 & & 128 \\
& & 132 & & & 135 \\
140 & & & & 144 \\
\end{matrix}$
Since 1 raised to any power is 1, the expression equals $1 + 4^6 \div 4^4$
Also recall that $\frac{a^m}{a^n}=a^{m-n}$, so we can simplify the last term to get $1+4^{6-4}=1+4^2=1+16=\boxed{17}$.
For simplicity, divide all the percent scores by $10.$ We will account for this later by multiplying by $10.$ The average percent score is equal to the sum of all percent scores divided by the total number of students $(100).$ The sum of all percent scores is $$10\cdot7+9\cdot18+8\cdot35+7\cdot25+6\cdot10+5\cdot3+4\cdot2=770.$$ Since we divided all the percent scores by $10$ in the beginning, we multiply by $10$ to get that the sum of all percent scores is $770\cdot10=7700.$ Finally, dividing by the total number of students, we find that the average percent score is $7700/100=\boxed{77}.$
Of the 24 people who applied, only 12 people are suitable to be hired
Therefore, there are 12 suited to be Assistant Engineer
After that position is filled, there are only 11 left for Weapons Maintenance, then 10 left for Field Technician, and then 9 for Radio Specialist
Therefore, there are $12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 = \boxed{11,\!880}$ possible ways in which Zarnin can fill his job openings.
We note that $$\frac{17}{4} = 4\frac{1}{4} \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{35}{2} = 17\frac{1}{2}.$$Therefore, the integers between these two numbers are the integers from $5$ to $17,$ inclusive
The odd integers in this range are $5,$ $7,$ $9,$ $11,$ $13,$ $15,$ and $17,$ of which there are $\boxed{7}.$
The second smallest prime number is 3 (preceded by 2)
We have $(3^2)^3=3^6=\boxed{729}$.
Let the measure of the angle be $x$, so $5^\circ$ more than four times the angle is $4x + 5^\circ$
Since these two measures are complementary, we have $x + (4x+5^\circ) = 90^\circ$
Simplifying the left side gives $5x+5^\circ = 90^\circ$, so $5x = 85^\circ$ and $x = \boxed{17^\circ}$.
We want to know what number makes the equation  \[? \times \dfrac{1}{10} = 5\]true
Dividing $5$ by $\dfrac{1}{10}$, we get the answer $5 \div \dfrac{1}{10} = \dfrac{5}{1} \times \dfrac{10}{1} = 5 \times 10 = 50$
The original price was $\boxed{\$50}.$
The number $3.45$ is just as close to $3.4$ as it is to $3.5$, and the rules for rounding say that in this case we round up
Thus $\boxed{3.5}$ is our answer.
The easiest approach is to consider how many times 9 can appear in the units place, how many times in the tens place, and how many times in the hundreds place
If we put a 9 in the units place, there are 10 choices for the tens place and 5 choices for the hundreds digit (including 0), for a total of 50 times
Likewise, if we put a 9 in the tens place, there are 10 choices for the units place and 5 choices for the hundreds digit, for a total of 50 times
Since 9 cannot appear in the hundreds digit, there are $50+50=\boxed{100}$ appearances of the digit 9.
Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes
Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\$10)+8(\$.25)+n(\$.10) \ge \$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \begin{align*}
30+2+.10n &\ge 32.75 \quad \implies \\
.10n &\ge .75 \quad \implies \\
n &\ge \frac{.75}{.10} \quad \implies \\
n &\ge 7.5.
\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.
The difference between three-fifths full and one-sixth full is $\frac{3}{5}-\frac{1}{6}=\frac{13}{30}$ of the tank's capacity
Let $x$ be the capacity of the tank in gallons
Since $\frac{13}{30}$ of the tank's capacity is 130 gallons, we have $\frac{13}{30}x = 130$
Multiplying both sides by $\frac{30}{13}$ gives $x = 300$, so the capacity is $\boxed{300}$ gallons.
There are seven possible colors for each slot, and there are four slots
Thus, $7^4 = \boxed{2401}$ secret codes are possible.
The mean number of home runs hit by these players is calculated by finding the total number of home runs and dividing that number by the total number of players
From the graph, we get that there is a total of $$6\cdot6+7\cdot 4+8\cdot3+10=98$$ home runs among the top 14 hitters
Therefore, the mean number of home runs hit by these players is  $$\frac{98}{14}=\boxed{7}.$$
The mean of 6, 9 and 18 is $$\frac{6+9+18}{3}=\frac{33}{3}=11.$$Since the mean of 12 and $y$ is thus 11, then the sum of 12 and $y$ is $2(11)=22$, so $y=\boxed{10}$.
Using the product of powers property and the quotient of powers property, we have \[2 \times 2^5 - 8^{58} \div 8^{56} = 2^{1+5} - 8^{58-56} = 2^6 - 8^2 = 64 - 64 = \boxed{0}.\]
By definition, an obtuse triangle contains one obtuse interior angle
It cannot contain more than one because an obtuse angle has measure greater than 90 degrees and the sum of all the interior angles in any triangle is 180 degrees
Thus, there is $\boxed{1}$ obtuse angle.
Since any of the digits may be a 2 or a 5, this leaves us 2 choices for each digit
There are then $2^3 =\boxed{8}$ 3-digit integers composed of only 2s and/or 5s.
Since they only ask for one length, you can assume that there's only one possible triangle
Then, quickly note that $39 = 3\cdot 13$, and that 5 - 12 - 13 is a Pythagorean triple
Therefore, the shorter leg has length $\boxed{15}$.
The rhombus is split into four congruent right triangles
Each right triangle has a leg of $\frac{6}{2}=3$ inches and another leg of $\frac82=4$ inches
We use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the length of the hypotenuse, or we recognize that $3$ and $4$ are part of the Pythagorean triple $(3,4,5)$, so the length of the hypotenuse is $5$ inches
Each side of the rhombus is $5$ inches long, so the perimeter is $4(5)=\boxed{20}$ inches.
The area of a circle is defined as $\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius
Since $\pi r^2 < 60\pi$, $r^2<60$, and since $r$ must be an integer, the greatest possible $r$ is $\boxed{7}$ inches.
Since the successive terms of the sequence increase by $3,$ we relate the sequence to nearby multiples of $3$ and display the table below
Compare each of the terms of the sequence with the multiple of $3$ directly below it
Notice that each term of the sequence is $2$ less than the corresponding multiple of $3$ directly below it
Since the $100^\text{th}$ multiple of $3$ is $300,$ the corresponding term of the sequence is $300-2=\boxed{298}.$ $$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{order of terms} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & \dots & 100 \\
\hline
\text{terms of sequence} & 1 & 4 & 7 & 10 & \dots & ? \\
\hline
\text{multiples of 3} & 3 & 6 & 9 & 12 & \dots & (300)\\
\hline
\end{array}
The angles numbered 1, 3, and 5 are the three interior angles of a triangle, so they sum to $180^\circ$
Similarly, the angles numbered 2, 4, and 6 are the three interior angles of a triangle, so they also sum to $180^\circ$
Combining these, the sum of all six angle measures is $180^\circ + 180^\circ = \boxed{360^\circ}$.
From the problem, we can write the following equation: \[3B + 2 = 20.\]Simplifying,  \begin{align*}
3B &= 18\\
B &= \boxed{6}.
\end{align*}
Two hundred fifty grams is $\frac{1}{4}$ of a kilogram
Therefore, the cost of transporting a 250 g control module is $\$22,\!000/4=\boxed{5500}$ dollars.
To find the mean, we add up the terms and divide by the number of terms
The mean of $5, 8$ and $17$ is $\frac{5+8+17}{3}=\frac{30}{3}=10$
We set this equal to the mean of $12$ and $y$ and get $$10=\frac{12+y}{2}\qquad\Rightarrow 20=12+y\qquad\Rightarrow 8=y.$$ The value of $y$ is $\boxed{8}$.
On each day but Wednesday, only one person can attend a meeting
On Wednesday, two people can
Thus, the day on which the most people can attend a meeting is $\boxed{\text{Wednesday}}.$
At first, we might think that there are $6+3=9$ boxes with pens or pencils
However, this counts twice the 2 boxes with both pens and pencils, so we subtract 2 from our total to only count these boxes once
That gives us $6+3-2=7$ boxes with pens or pencils, which leaves $10-7=\boxed{3\text{ boxes}}$ with neither.
The ratio of time it takes Bob to read a page to the time it takes Chandra to read a page is $45:30$ or $3:2,$ so Bob should read $\frac{2}{3}$ of the number of pages that Chandra reads
Divide the book into $5$ parts, each with $\frac{760}{5}=152$ pages
Chandra will read the first $3\cdot152 =\boxed{456}$ pages, while Bob reads the last $2\cdot152=304$ pages.
The first discount means that the customer will pay $70\%$ of the original price
The second discount means a selling price of $80\%$ of  the discounted price
Because $0.80(0.70) = 0.56 = 56\% $, the customer pays $56\%$ of the original price and thus receives a $44\%$ discount, for a difference of $50\% - 44\% = \boxed{6\%}$.
There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails)
There are 2 possibilities for the penny and the dime: either they're both heads or they're both tails
There are also 2 possibilities for the nickel and 2 possibilities for the quarter
So there are $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$ successful outcomes, and the probability of success is $\dfrac{8}{16} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{2}}$.
The problem tells us that $45.7 \% $ of the people who think rats carry diseases equates to $21$ people total
If the total number of people who think that rats carry diseases is $x$, then we solve for $x$ as follows: $0.457x = 21$, so $x = 45.95$
However, we know that $x$ must be an integer, so rounding up, we get $x=46.$ Now, these $46$ people represent $86.8 \%$ of the total number of people surveyed
So, if we let $y$ be the total number of people surveyed, we can solve for $y$ as follows: $0.868y = 46$, so $y = 52.995$
Rounding up, we get that John surveyed $\boxed{53}$ total people.
Drawing an altitude of an equilateral triangle splits it into two 30-60-90 right triangles: [asy]
unitsize(0.6inch);
pair A, B, C, F;
A = (0,1);
B = rotate(120)*A;
C = rotate(120)*B;
F = foot(A,B,C);
draw(A--B--C--A,linewidth(1));
draw(A--F);
[/asy]
The altitude is the longer leg of each 30-60-90 triangle, and the hypotenuse of each 30-60-90 triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle, so the altitude's length is $\sqrt{3}/2$ times the side length of the triangle.
Therefore, the altitude of the equilateral triangle in the problem is $8(\sqrt{3}/2) = 4\sqrt{3}$, so the area of the equilateral triangle is $(8)(4\sqrt{3})/2 = 16\sqrt{3}$
The perimeter of the triangle is $3 \cdot 8 = 24$
Thus, the ratio of area to perimeter is $\frac{16\sqrt{3}}{24}=\boxed{\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}}.$
Let $w$ be Yan's walking speed, and let $x$ and $y$ be the distances from Yan to his home and to the stadium, respectively
The time required for Yan to walk to the stadium is $y/w$, and the time required for him to walk home is $x/w$
Because he rides his bicycle at a speed of $7w$, the time required for him to ride his bicycle from his home to the stadium is $(x+y)/(7w)$
Thus \[\frac{y}{w}=\frac{x}{w}+\frac{x+y}{7w} = \frac{8x + y}{7w}.\]As a consequence, $7y = 8x + y$, so  $8x=6y$
The required ratio is $x/y=6/8=\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.
This is the percent that has either fewer than 10,000 or 10,000 to 99,999 residents, so we add those two percentages, giving $25\%+59\%=\boxed{84\%}$.
To start, we need to find a common denominator and add the fractions under the square root
Be careful to do this first, and not mix up this kind of expression with: $$\sqrt{\frac{16}{25}}+\sqrt{\frac{9}{4}}$$ The two fractions have a common denominator of 100
Combine them and simplify: $$\sqrt{\frac{16}{25}+\frac{9}{4}}=\sqrt{\frac{64+225}{100}}=\frac{\sqrt{289}}{10}=\boxed{\frac{17}{10}}$$
Because $4 > \sqrt{x} > 3$, we know that $16 > x > 9$
Thus, the integers from 10 to 15 inclusive satisfy this inequality, which means $\boxed{6}$ integers satisfy the condition in the problem.
We will simplify the fraction inside the square root first
Since $0.001=10^{-3}$, we can rewrite the fraction as $\frac{10^{73}}{10^{-3}}=10^{76}$
The entire equation becomes $10^n=10^{-5}\times \sqrt{10^{76}}$
Taking the square root of $10^{76}$ gives us \[\sqrt{10^{76}} = \sqrt{10^{38\cdot 2}} = \sqrt{(10^{38})^2} = 10^{38}.\] Therefore, our equation now is $10^n=10^{-5}\times 10^{38}$
The right hand side becomes $10^{-5+38}=10^{33}$
The equation becomes $10^n=10^{33}$, so $n=\boxed{33}$.
$75 = 3^1 \cdot 5^2$ and $360 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1$, so $\gcd(75, 360) = 3^1 \cdot 5^1 = \boxed{15}$.
There are currently 19 Mathletes there, so if the room numbers are listed in order we want the 10th, with 9 rooms before and 9 after
The 10th room is just room number $\boxed{10}$, since no numbers are skipped in the first ten.
The jar contains $29\frac{5}{7}\div 2$ servings of peanut butter
Recalling that $a\div b=\frac{a}{b}$, we get $$29\frac{5}{7}\div 2=29\frac{5}{7}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{208}{7}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{104}{7}=14\frac{6}{7}.$$The jar contains $\boxed{14\frac{6}{7}}$ servings of peanut butter.
Call the radius of the outer circle $r_1$ and that of the inner circle $r_2$
The width of the track is $r_1-r_2$
The circumference of a circle is $2\pi$ times the radius, so the difference in circumferences is $2\pi r_1-2\pi r_2=10\pi$ feet
If we divide each side by $2\pi$, we get $r_1-r_2=\boxed{5}$ feet.
After adding 20 roses, Nikki will have $25+20=45$ roses
If she will have 2 irises for every 5 roses, then she will have $2(9)=\boxed{18}$ irises.
Call the angle measure $x$
We are given that $180^{\circ}-x=6(90^{\circ}-x)$
This expands to $180^{\circ}-x=540^{\circ}-6x$ or $5x=360^{\circ}$ and $x=\boxed{72^{\circ}}$.
The area of rectangle $ABCD$ is $(8\text{ cm})(4\text{ cm})=32$ square centimeters
The area of triangle $ABM$ is $\frac{1}{2}(AB)(BM)=\frac{1}{2}(8\text{ cm})(2\text{ cm})=8$ square centimeters
The area of triangle $ADN$ is $\frac{1}{2}(AD)(DN)=\frac{1}{2}(4\text{ cm})(4\text{ cm})=8$ square centimeters
Subtracting these two triangles from the rectangle, we find that the area of quadrilateral $AMCN$ is $32\text{ cm}^2-8\text{ cm}^2-8\text{ cm}^2=\boxed{16}$ square centimeters.
We need to simplify the given expression
Let's start by simplifying the inside of the parenthesis on the left part of the expression
\begin{align*}
((5p+1)&-2p\cdot4)(3)+(4-1\div3)(6p-9)\\
&=(5p+1-8p)(3)+(4-1\div3)(6p-9)\\
&=(-3p+1)(3)+(4-1\div3)(6p-9)
\end{align*} Next we can distribute the 3 to get $$3\cdot(-3p)+3\cdot1+(4-1\div3)(6p-9),$$ which equals $-9p+3+(4-1\div3)(6p-9)$
The left part looks simplified so now we can focus on the right part
Let's subtract what's in the left parentheses then distribute
\begin{align*}
-9p+3+(4-1\div3)(6p-9)&=-9p+3+(\frac{4\cdot3}{3}-\frac{1}{3})(6p-9)\\
&=-9p+3+\frac{11}{3}(6p-9)\\
&=-9p+3+\frac{11}{3}\cdot6p-\frac{11}{3}\cdot9\\
&=-9p+3+\frac{11\cdot6p}{3}-\frac{11\cdot9}{3}\\
&=-9p+3+\frac{66p}{3}-\frac{99}{3}\\
&=-9p+3+\frac{3\cdot22p}{3}-\frac{3\cdot33}{3}\\
&=-9p+3+22p-33\\
&=22p-9p+3-33\\
&=\boxed{13p-30}\\
\end{align*}
We can see that $180$ and $120$ have a common factor of $60$
Also, note that $16$ and $8$ have a common factor of $8$
This means we can simplify to get $$\frac{180}{16}\cdot \frac{5}{120}\cdot \frac{8}{3}=\frac{\cancelto{3}{180}}{\cancelto{2}{16}}\cdot \frac{5}{\cancelto{2}{120}}\cdot \frac{\cancel{8}}{3}=\frac{3}{2}\cdot \frac{5}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{3}.$$Now, notice that we can cancel the factor of $3$ in the numerator and the denominator
Therefore, we have $$\frac{3}{2}\cdot \frac{5}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{3}=\frac{\cancel{3}}{2}\cdot \frac{5}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{\cancel{3}}=\frac{5\cdot 1}{2\cdot 2}=\boxed{\frac{5}{4}}.$$
There are 20 square posts which are not on a corner, so there are $20/4=5$ square posts on each side, not including the corner posts
Including the corner posts, there are 7 posts on a side, which means that there are 6 five-foot gaps between posts
Altogether the length of a side is $7\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)+6(5)=32\frac{1}{3}$ feet
The perimeter of the square is four times the side length, so the perimeter is $4\cdot 32\frac{1}{3}=\boxed{129\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.
Since the mean of four numbers is just their sum divided by four, the mean is $\dfrac{1/2}{4} = \boxed{\frac{1}{8}}$.
Note that 12 and 36 have a common factor of 12
Also, 7 and 35 have a common factor of 7
Since there is one negative sign among all the factors, our result will be negative
We get \[
9\cdot\frac{12}{7}\cdot \frac{-35}{36}=-9\cdot\frac{\cancel{12}}{\cancel{7}}\cdot \frac{\cancelto{5}{35}}{\cancelto{3}{36}} \quad =-\frac{9\cdot 5}{3}
\]Now, we see that 9 and 3 have a common factor of 3
So, we get \[
-\frac{9\cdot 5}{3}=-\frac{\cancelto{3}{9}\cdot 5}{\cancel{3}}=\boxed{-15}.
There are 6 choices of a shirt and 5 choices of a tie, so the total number of outfits is $6 \times 5 = \boxed{30}$.
There are $85+73=158$ jobs to be done
$27$ people do two of the jobs, so that leaves $158 - 27\cdot 2 = 158-54 = 104$ jobs remaining
The remaining workers do one job each, so we need $27 + 104 = \boxed{131}$ workers.
We also might construct the Venn Diagram below
We start in the middle of the diagram, with the 27 workers who do both:
label("Water", (2,67));
label("Air", (80,67));
draw(Circle((30,45), 22));
draw(Circle((58, 45), 22));
label("27", (44, 45));
label(scale(0.8)*"$85-27$",(28,58));
label(scale(0.8)*"$73-27$",(63,58));
[/asy]
This gives us $27 + (73-27) + (85-27) = \boxed{131}$ workers total.
Let the original area be $x$
Since the area of the rectangle is length multiplied by width, increasing the length of a rectangle by 25 percent increases the area to $1.25x$
We need to multiply this area by some number $y$ to decrease it back to $x$
We have the equation $1.25xy=x\Rightarrow y=1/1.25=.8$
So the width needs to be decreased to $.8$ times of the original in order to change the area back to the original area
Thus, the width needs to be adjusted $\boxed{20}$ percent.
If the athlete runs at a pace of $5$ minutes/mile, the entire race will take $5\text{ mins/mile}\times26\text{ miles}=130$ minutes
The athlete's heart is beating 150 times per minutes, so the total number of heart beats will be $130 \text{ minutes}\times150\text{ beats/minute}=\boxed{19500}$.
The area of a rhombus can be expressed as: $\frac{d_1 d_2}{2}$, where $d_1 , d_2$ are the lengths of the diagonals
(Think of each quadrant as a triangle, and sum those areas - you'll see it comes out to this formula)  Plugging in $d_1 = 24$ and $d_2 = 10$, we get $\frac{24\cdot 10}{2} = \boxed{120}$ square units.
Drawing the diagonal of a square divides the square into two 45-45-90 triangles
The diagonal is the hypotenuse of both triangles, and each leg of each triangle is a side of the square
Since the hypotenuse of a 45-45-90 triangle is $\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg, the length of the diagonal of the square is \[50\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt2 = 50\left(\sqrt{2}\right)^2 = 50\cdot 2 = \boxed{100}.\]
From the given graph, it is visible that the student headcount in spring of `02-`03 was 10,900 students, in spring of `03-`04 the headcount was 10,500, and in spring of `04-`05, the headcount was  10,700
The average is $$\frac{10900+10500+10700}{3}=\frac{32100}{3}=\boxed{10700}$$ students.
40 percent of 50 percent of $x$ is $.4(.5x))=.2x$, so $\boxed{20}$ percent of $x$ is equal to the given value.
If Trisha's mean score is 81 after five tests, she must have scored a total of $5\cdot 81 - (88 + 73 + 70) = 174$ on her last two tests
Keeping in mind that each test score was less than 90, this means that Trisha got scores of 87 and 87, 88 and 86, or 89 and 85 on her last two tests.
Since all of Trisha's scores are different integer values, she can't have gotten scores of 87 and 87 on her last two tests
Also, since she already got an 88 on a test, she can't have gotten scores of 88 and 86 either
This means that she must have gotten scores of 89 and 85 on her last two tests.
Thus, Trisha's scores are 88, 73, 70, 89, and 85
Listing these from greatest to least, we see that our answer is $\boxed{89, 88, 85, 73, 70}$.
I can pick one face in $6$ ways
Then, I have $4$ choices for the second face, because I can't pick the first face again, nor can I pick the unique face with which it makes $7$
So I seem to have $6\cdot 4 = 24$ choices -- but this actually overcounts the possible results by a factor of $2$, because in the end, it doesn't matter which of the two red faces I chose first and which I chose second
So the actual number of possibilities is $24/2$, or $\boxed{12}$.
There's another neat way to see this! If you have an ordinary die, you may notice that the pairs of numbers which add up to $7$ are all on pairs of opposite faces
(For example, the $1$ is opposite the $6$.) This means that in order to paint two faces that don't add up to $7$, I must choose any two faces that aren't opposite
Two faces that aren't opposite must share an edge, and there is exactly one pair of faces meeting along each edge of the die
Since a cube has $12$ edges, there are $\boxed{12}$ choices I can make.
Let $n$ be John's number
$n$ is a multiple of $125=5^3$ and of $30=2\cdot3\cdot5$, so the prime factorization of $n$ must contain 5 raised to at least the 3rd power, 2 raised to at least the 1st power, and 3 raised to at least the 1st power
Thus, $\text{LCM}(125, 30)=2\cdot3\cdot5^3= 750$
$n$ is then some multiple of 750
Since $n$ is between 800 and 2000, $n=750$ is too small
Thus, we try $n=2 \cdot 750=1500$
This number could be John's number
Notice that $n=3 \cdot 750=2250$ is too large
Thus, John's number is $\boxed{1500}$.
We could simply start dividing and look for a pattern, but there is a cooler way using the fact that $1=.\overline{9999}$
Then \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{1111} &= \frac{.\overline{9999}}{1111}\\
&=.\overline{0009}.
\end{align*}The first 40 digits after the decimal point consist of ten blocks of $0009$, so their sum is $10\cdot(0+0+0+9)=\boxed{90}$.
Note that $16=2^4$ is a power of two
We can use the rule $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$ to find that \[16^2 = (2^4)^2 = 2^8.\]Now we return back to the original problem
After substituting in $16^2=2^8$, we use the rule $a^b \div a^c = a^{b-c}$: \begin{align*}
2^{16} \div 16^2 &= 2^{16} \div 2^8 \\
&= 2^{16-8} \\
&= 2^8 = \boxed{256}.
\end{align*}
We count the number of rectangles by cases, based on the side lengths of the rectangle: \[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline
\text{Side lengths of rectangle} & \text{Number of rectangles} \\ \hline
1 \times 1 & 9 \\ \hline
1 \times 2 & 6 \\ \hline
1 \times 3 & 3 \\ \hline
2 \times 1 & 6 \\ \hline
2 \times 2 & 4 \\ \hline
2 \times 3 & 2 \\ \hline
3 \times 1 & 3 \\ \hline
3 \times 2 & 2 \\ \hline
3 \times 3 & 1 \\ \hline
\end{array}
\] So the number of rectangles whose sides are parallel to the sides of the grid is $9+6+3+6+4+2+3+2+1 = \boxed{36}.$
Extra challenge: If you know what "combinations" are in counting problems, try to find a much faster solution!
We draw segment $\overline{CD}$ as shown parallel to lines $l$ and $k$.
size(200); real h = 1.2; currentpen = fontsize(10pt);
draw(Label("$l$",Relative(1)),(0,0)--(1,0),E);
draw(Label("$k$",Relative(1)),(0,-h)--(1,-h),E);
draw((0,-h)--h/2*(cos(150*pi/180),sin(150*pi/180)) + (0,-h));
draw(Label("$C$",Relative(1)),(0,0)--h*sqrt(3)/2*(cos(-120*pi/180),sin(-120*pi/180)),W);
label("$A$",(0,0),N); label("$B$",(0,-h),S);
label("$120^\circ$",(0,0),SE);
pair D = (h*sqrt(3)/2*(cos(-120*pi/180),sin(-120*pi/180))) + (2,0);
draw(D -- (D-(2,0)));
dot(D);
label("$D$",D,E);
[/asy]
Since $\overline{CD}\parallel l$, we have $\angle ACD = 180^\circ - \angle A = 60^\circ$, so $\angle DCB = \angle ACB - \angle ACD = 80^\circ - 60^\circ = 20^\circ$
Since $\overline{CD}\parallel k$, we have $\angle B = 180^\circ - \angle DCB = \boxed{160^\circ}$.
We write $17^9=17^2\cdot 17^7$ using the product-of-powers property, which says that $a^{m+n} = a^ma^n$
We get \[
17^9 \div 17^7 = 17^2\cdot 17^7 \div 17^7 = 17^2 \cdot 1 = \boxed{289},
\]since any nonzero number divided by itself equals 1.
The area of a trapezoid is equal to the product of the height and the average of the lengths of the bases
In this case, since the length of the two bases are $2x$ and $3x$ and the length of the height is $x$, the area is equal to $\frac{2x+3x}{2} \cdot x=\frac{5x}{2}\cdot x=\boxed{\dfrac{5x^2}{2}}$.
49 is the number whose square root is 7, so we must have \[(x+3)^2 = 49.\] Therefore, we must have $x+3 = 7$ or $x+3 = -7$
The first equation gives us $x = 4$ the second gives us $x = -10$
Both are solutions, so the sum of all possible values of $x$ is $4 + (-10) = \boxed{-6}$.
This can easily be converted into a fraction over a power of ten: \[
\frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \cdot 125}{8 \cdot 125} = \frac{375}{1000} = \boxed{0.375}.
\]Note: In general if you have a fraction that is some $\frac{x}{2^k}$, multiplying the numerator and denominator by $5^k$ will give a power of $10$ in the denominator for easy conversion to a decimal
In this case, $k = 3$.
We know that $210 = 10 \cdot 21$
Breaking down these factors even further, we have that $10 = 2 \cdot 5$ and $21 = 3 \cdot 7$, so $210 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$
Since these factors are all prime, $210$ has $\boxed{4}$ distinct prime factors.
There are $65-10 = 55$ students taking only math, $43-10=33$ taking only physics, and 10 taking both
$100-55-33-10= \boxed{2}$ students take neither.
I can choose one book in $9$ ways
Then, for the second book, I have $6$ choices that aren't in the same genre as the first book
It would seem that I have $9\cdot 6$ choices for the two books; however, this overcounts pairs by a factor of $2$, since each pair has been counted in two ways (once in either order)
So, the actual number of pairs is $(9\cdot 6)/2$, which is $\boxed{27}$.
Alternative solution: Of the three genres of book, one must be excluded
We can choose the genre to be excluded in $3$ ways
Then, of the two remaining genres, we can choose a book of the first genre in $3$ ways, and we can choose a book of the second genre in $3$ ways
This gives us $3\cdot 3\cdot 3 = \boxed{27}$ possible sets of choices (all of which produce different pairs of books, with no overcounting).
The number of school days until they will next be together is the least common multiple of $3$, $4$, $6$, and $7$, which is $\boxed{84}$.
Following the order of operations, we have \begin{align*}
5-7(8-3^2)4&=5-7(8-9)4\\
&=5-7(-1)(4)\\
&= 5-(-28)\\
&=5+28 = \boxed{33}.
\end{align*}
If we let the measure of angle $B$ equal $x$, then the measure of angle $A$ is $8x$
Since angles $A$ and $B$ are supplementary, we can say that $x + 8x = 180$
If we solve for $x$ we find that $x = 20$
Thus, angle $A = 8(20) = \boxed{160}\text{ degrees}$.
Expanding both products gives \[3r - 3\cdot 7 = 4\cdot 2 - 4\cdot 2r + 4,\] so $3r - 21 = 8 - 8r + 4$
Simplifying the right-hand side gives $3r -21 = 12-8r$
Adding $8r$ and 21 to both sides gives $11r = 33$, so $r=\boxed{3}$.
We set up the equation and solve for $x$: \begin{align*}
\frac{2x+3}{5}&=11\qquad\Rightarrow\\
2x+3&=55\qquad\Rightarrow\\
2x&=52\qquad\Rightarrow\\
x&=\boxed{26}.
\end{align*}
The $3$-digit multiples of $20$ are $$100, 120, 140, 160, \ldots, 960, 980.$$ To form the numbers in this list, we can choose any of $9$ hundreds digits and any of $5$ tens digits (but we have only one option for the units digit, which must be $0$)
So, there are $9\cdot 5 = 45$ multiples of $20$ in our list
However, we want to exclude those which are also multiples of $55$.
The least common multiple of $20$ and $55$ is $220$, so we have to exclude the multiples of $220$ from our list
There are four such numbers: $220$, $440$, $660$, and $880$
This leaves $45-4 = \boxed{41}$ three-digit multiples of $20$ which are not multiples of $55$.
The children in the Gauss family have ages $7,$ $7,$ $7,$ $14,$ $15.$ The mean of their ages is thus $$\frac{7+7+7+14+15}{5} = \frac{50}{5}=\boxed{10}.$$
$y=\frac{60}{5}=12$ and $x=\frac{12}{2}=\boxed{6}$.
Let $n$ be the number of sides in the polygon
The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees
Since each angle in the given polygon measures $162^\circ$, the sum of the interior angles of this polygon is also $162n$
Therefore, we must have  \[180(n-2) = 162n.\] Expanding the left side gives $180n - 360 = 162n$, so $18n = 360$ and $n = \boxed{20}$.
We might also have noted that each exterior angle of the given polygon measures $180^\circ - 162^\circ = 18^\circ$
The exterior angles of a polygon sum to $360^\circ$, so there must be $\frac{360^\circ}{18^\circ} = 20$ of them in the polygon.
Consider the primes that are less than 30: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29
We must find 2 primes on this list whose difference is at least 6 (which means there are 5 consecutive integers that are composite between them)
$29-23=6$ and the other differences are all less than 6
Thus, the largest of the five composites is $\boxed{28}$.
Since the number of pencils in a package must be a divisor of both $24$ and $40$, the largest possible number of pencils in a package is the GCD of $40$ and $24$
Factoring, $24 = 2^3\cdot 3$ and $40 = 2^3\cdot 5$
The only prime common to both factorizations is $2$, raised the $3$rd power, so the GCD is $2^3 = \boxed{8}$.
We multiply the fractions by $60$ to get $\frac13\times\frac14\times\frac15\times60=\frac{60}{3\times4\times5}=\frac{60}{60}=\boxed{1}$.
The percentage of cars sold that were Hondas is $100-15-22-28=35$ percent
Since there are 200 total cars, $200\cdot 0.35=\boxed{70}$ cars are Hondas.
The original number of chairs is divisible by $11$, and the final number of remaining chairs must also be divisible by $11$ to have complete rows
This means that the number of chairs removed must be divisible by $11$ because the difference between two multiples of $b$ is also a multiple of $b$
In other words, $$b \cdot m - b \cdot n = b \cdot k.$$ The smallest multiple of $11$ greater than $70$ is $77$, so we want $77$ chairs to remain
This means we must take away \begin{align*}
110 - 77 &= 11 \cdot 10 - 11 \cdot 7 \\
&= 11(10-7) \\
&= 11 \cdot 3 \\
&= \boxed{33}
\end{align*} chairs
We check that $33$ is divisible by $11$, and it is, so we took away $3$ complete rows of chairs.
The fact that the width of each side of the frame is 10 cm means that each side of the mirror is 20 cm smaller than the corresponding side of the frame
Therefore, the mirror measures 40 cm by 60 cm, with an area of $\boxed{2400 \mbox{ cm}^2}$.
Let $x=0.\overline{009}$
Then $1000x=9.\overline{009}$ and $1000x-x=999x=9$
Therefore, $0.\overline{009}=\frac{9}{999}$, which in lowest terms is $\frac{1}{111}$
The product of the numerator and the denominator is $1\cdot 111=\boxed{111}$.
Simplify $\sqrt{20}$ as $\sqrt{2^2}\cdot\sqrt5 = 2\sqrt5$
Also simplify $\sqrt{45}$ as $\sqrt{3^2}\cdot\sqrt5 = 3\sqrt5$
The desired expression is $\sqrt5-2\sqrt5+3\sqrt5 = \boxed{2\sqrt5}$.
First, we simplify the radicals as much as possible
We have $\sqrt{54} = \sqrt{2\cdot 3^3} = \sqrt{2\cdot 3\cdot 3^2} = 3\sqrt{2\cdot 3} = 3\sqrt{6}$, and $\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{2^5} = \sqrt{2^4\cdot 2} = 4\sqrt{2}$
Therefore, we have \begin{align*}\sqrt{54}\cdot\sqrt{32} \cdot \sqrt{6} &= (3\sqrt{6})(4\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{6}) = 3\cdot 4\sqrt{6}\cdot\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}\\
&= 12\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{6}\sqrt{6}) = (12\sqrt{2})(6) = \boxed{72\sqrt{2}}.\end{align*}
To obtain the diameter of the circle that is the outer boundary of the walking path, we can find the radius and then double it
To find the radius, we add the radius of the fountain to the widths of the garden ring and the walking path
Thus, the radius is $5+8+6 = 19$
Doubling $19$ gives a diameter of $\boxed{38}$ feet.
Subtracting $1$ from each expression, we have $-5\le 2x\le 5$
Dividing by $2$, we get $-\frac52\le x\le \frac52$
The integers satisfying this chain of inequalities are $-2,-1,0,1,2$
There are $\boxed{5}$ numbers in this list.
Calculating, $$3 \times (7 - 5) - 5 = 3 \times 2 - 5 = 6 - 5 = \boxed{1}.$$
Looking at triangle $ABD$, we can calculate $AB$ through the Pythagorean Theorem
\begin{align*}
AB&=\sqrt{37^2-(19+16)^2}\\
&=\sqrt{37^2-35^2}\\
&=\sqrt{(37+35)(37-35)}\\
&=\sqrt{72 \cdot 2}\\
&=\sqrt{36 \cdot 4}=6 \cdot 2=12\end{align*} Using Pythagorean theorem again to find $BC$, we get \begin{align*}
BC&=\sqrt{12^2+16^2}\\
&=\sqrt{4^2(3^2+4^2)}\\
&=4\sqrt{9+16}\\
&=4\sqrt{25}=4 \cdot 5=\boxed{20} \text{ units}.\end{align*}
There are 5 options for the first topping and 4 options left for the second topping for a preliminary count of $5\cdot4=20$ options
However, the order in which we put the toppings on doesn't matter, so we've counted each combination twice, which means our final answer is $\dfrac{5\cdot4}{2}=\boxed{10}$ combinations.
Recall that "one-fourth of" means the same thing as "one-fourth times." So we are asked to find  \[
\frac{1}{4}\cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]We then have \[
\frac{1}{4}\cdot 6 \cdot 8 =\frac14\cdot 48 = \frac{48}{4} = 48\div 4 =\boxed{12}.
Since there is no mention that a student cannot be picked twice, there are 11 possible victims every time the class meets
Therefore, our answer is $11 \cdot 11 \cdot 11 \cdot 11 = 11^4 = \boxed{14,\!641}.$
Since the problem asks for the least possible number, you should start with the lowest number ($0$) and work your way up (and across the number.) Nothing is divisible by zero, so zero cannot be one of the digits in the four-digit number
Every whole number is divisible by $1$, so the digit $1$ should be in the thousands place to create the smallest number
The digits must be different, so put a $2$ in the hundreds place
Now, you have to make sure the number is even
You can put a $3$ in the tens place, but you cannot use $4$ for the ones place since $1234$ is not divisible by $3$ or $4$
$1235$ is not even, so it is not divisible by $2$ (or for that matter, by $3$)
$\boxed{1236}$ is divisible by all of its own digits.
After the first year, its price has doubled to $\$200$
In the second year, its price declines by one fourth, or $\$50$
The price at the end of the second year is $\$200-\$50=\boxed{\$150}$.
There are 2 possible outcomes for the coin and 6 possible outcomes for the die, so there are $2 \times 6 = 12$ equally likely outcomes
Only 1 of these is a successful outcome: the coin must show heads and the die must show 2
So the probability is $\boxed{\dfrac{1}{12}}$.
If $n$ is the side length of the square, we have $n=\sqrt{\frac14}$, so $n^2=\frac14$
Since $\left({\frac12}\right)^2=\frac14$, we have $n = \boxed{\frac12}$.
First, we find a common denominator, which in this case is the least common multiple of $2$ and $3$, or $6$
Thus we have $$\frac{2(x+1)}{6}+\frac{3(2-3x)}{6}=\frac{2(x+1)+3(2-3x)}{6}.$$Simplifying the numerator, we get $$\frac{2x+2+6-9x}{6}= \boxed{\frac{8-7x}{6}}.$$
We divide the 750 mL of flour into portions of 250 mL
We do this by calculating $750 \div 250 = 3$
Therefore, 750 mL is three portions of 250 mL.
Since 50 mL of milk is required for each 250 mL of flour, then $3\times 50 = \boxed{150}$ mL of milk is required in total.
Since $M = 2007 \div 3$, then $M = 669$.
Since $N = M \div 3$, then $N = 669 \div 3 = 223$.
Since $X = M-N$, then $X = 669 - 223 = \boxed{446}$.
Consider two cases:
Case 1: No Americans get a medal
So there are 5 choices for the gold medal, 4 choices for the silver, and 3 choices for bronze, which is $5\times4\times3=60$ ways.
Case 2: One American gets a medal
There are 3 Americans to choose from
After we choose which American to get the medal, we have to decide which medal to reward the American, for which we have 3 choices
Then we have 5 choices for one of the remaining medal and 4 choices for the last medal
So, we have a total of $3\times3\times5\times4=180$ ways.
Sum up the two cases, and we have a total of $180+60=\boxed{240}$ ways.
$2000-1990 = 10$ years passed between the years $1990$ and $2000$, during which the number of transistors doubled $10 \div 2 = 5$ times
Doubling a number five times means multiplying it by two raised to the fifth power
Thus we carry out the multiplication to get our answer: \[1,\!000,\!000 \cdot 2^5 = 1,\!000,\!000 \cdot 32 = \boxed{32,\!000,\!000} \text{ transistors}.\]
To find the least common multiple of the positive integers less than or equal to 8, we prime factorize each of them
\begin{align*}
2 &= 2 \\
3 &= 3 \\
4 &= 2^2 \\
5 &= 5 \\
6 &= 2\cdot 3 \\
7 &= 7 \\
8 &= 2^3.
\end{align*} Taking the maximum exponent for each prime, we find a least common multiple of $2^3\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7=(2\cdot5)\cdot 2^2\cdot3\cdot7=10\cdot84=\boxed{840}$.
We have
$$\frac{12+21+x}{3}=18\Rightarrow 33+x=54$$
So $x=\boxed{21}$.
We will keep a running tally of the number of home runs of the two players
By March, McGwire had 1 home run and Sosa 0
By April, McGwire had $1+10=11$ home runs and Sosa 6
By May, McGwire had $11+16=27$ home runs and Sosa $6+7=13$
By June, McGwire had $27+10=37$ home runs and Sosa $13+20=33$
By July, McGwire had $37+8=45$ home runs and Sosa $33+9=42$
By August, McGwire had $45+10=55$ home runs and Sosa $42+13=55$
Thus, by the end of $\boxed{\text{August}}$, McGwire and Sosa had the same number of home runs.
$1.45$ expressed as a mixed number is $1 \frac{45}{100}$
We simplify the fraction by dividing top and bottom by the greatest common denominator, which is 5
This yields $1 \frac{9}{20}$, which can be expressed as a fraction, since $ 1+ \frac{9}{20} =$ $\boxed{\frac{29}{20}}$.
The total number of rounds played by all the golfers is $5(1)+2(2)+2(3)+3(4)+5(5) = 52$
The number of golfers is obtained by simply counting the dots; there are $5+2+2+3+5 = 17$
This means the average number of rounds played is $\dfrac{52}{17}$, which is equal to $3\dfrac{1}{17}$
The nearest whole number is $\boxed{3}$.
Notice that we can estimate the answer rather effectively, based on the fact that the table is nearly symmetrical around the middle value of $3$.
There are $26$ choices for the first letter, $26$ for the second, and $26$ for the third
The last letter is determined by the first letter
Thus, there are $26^3 = \boxed{17576}$ such combinations.
We factor the numbers: \[30=2\cdot3\cdot5, \quad 90=2\cdot3^2\cdot5, \quad 75=3\cdot5^2.\]  Taking the highest factor that occurs in all of the numbers, we have that the GCF is $3\cdot5=\boxed{15}$.
The area of the rectangle is $(6)(8)=48$, so the area of triangle $DEF$ is $48/4 =12$
Since $DE=DF$, the area of $DEF$ is $(DE)(DF)/2 = DE^2/2$, so $DE^2/2 = 12$
Therefore, $DE^2 = 24$
From the Pythagorean Theorem, we have  \[EF^2 = DE^2 +DF^2 = 24+24=48,\] so $EF =\sqrt{48} = \boxed{4\sqrt{3}}$.
Multiplying both sides by $\frac{5}{3}$ gives $\frac{1}{9} \cdot x = 6\cdot \frac53 = 10$, and then multiplying by 9 gives $x = \boxed{90}$.
We want to subtract $\frac{3}{4}$ from $\frac{6}{7}$
To do this, we first put the two fractions over a common denominator
Since the least common multiple of $4$ and $7$ is $28$, we write $\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{7}{7} = \frac{21}{28}$ and $\frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{4}{4} = \frac{24}{28}$, so our difference is: $$\frac{6}{7} - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{24}{28} - \frac{21}{28} = \frac{24-21}{28} = \frac{3}{28}.$$Therefore, the first student ate $\boxed{\frac{3}{28}}$ more of the pie than the second student.
There are 10 integers between $-4$ and 5 inclusive; the sum of these integers is 5, since the sum of the integers between $-4$ and 4 is zero
So the mean is $5/10 = \boxed{0.5}$.
Adding $7$ and subtracting $x$ from both sides of the inequality, we have that $7<x$
The smallest value $x$ that satisfies this inequality is $x = \boxed{8}$.
The median is the number in the set with half the other numbers larger than it and half the others smaller
To maximize the median, we need to make $x$ as large as possible, so the items $x$ and $2x$ are as large as possible
Then, the median is $\boxed{5}$, since 3 and 2 (half the other members) are smaller than it and $x$ and $2x$ are larger than it.
The proportion of lemons to gallons of lemonade must always remain constant
Thus, $\frac{24}{32} = \frac{x}{4}$, where $x$ is the number of lemons required to make $4$ gallons of lemonade
$\frac{24}{32}$ simplifies to $\frac{3}{4}$, so we have $\frac{3}{4} = \frac{x}{4}$
Therefore, $x = 3$
So, $\boxed{3}$ lemons are needed to make $4$ gallons of lemonade.
The smallest three-digit number is $100$
When we divide 100 by 13, we get 7 with a remainder of 9
$$100=13 \cdot 7 + 9$$Because we want the smallest three-digit multiple of $13$, $13\cdot 7$ cannot be our answer because it is less than $100$ and is therefore a two-digit number
Instead we go up one multiple of $13$ and find that $13 \cdot 8= \boxed{104}$ is our smallest three-digit multiple of $13$.
If we add 46 and 37, we get 83
Rounding 83 to the nearest ten gives $\boxed{80}$ since 83 is closer to 80 than it is to 90.
Note: Van's mistake of rounding before arriving at the final answer is a common one
It is called "intermediate rounding."
Let's consider building such an arrangement
We can choose the first letter in 6 ways
After we have chosen the first letter, we can choose the second in 5 ways
Similarly, the third letter then has 4 ways of being chosen, the next letter 3, the next 2, and the last only 1
Thus the total number of arrangements is $6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1 = \boxed{720}$.
The area of a right triangle is half the product of the lengths of its legs
Thus, the area of the triangle is $$(1/2)(40)(42) = \boxed{840\text{ square inches}}.$$
We have  \[0.18 \div 0.003 = \frac{0.18}{0.003} = \frac{0.18}{0.003}\cdot \frac{1000}{1000}
=\frac{180}{3} = \boxed{60}.\]
Let $s$ be the side length of the square
Then the dimensions of each rectangle are $s\times\frac{s}{5}$
The perimeter of one of the rectangles is $s+\frac{s}{5}+s+\frac{s}{5}=\frac{12}{5}s$
Setting $\frac{12}{5}s=36$ inches, we find $s=15$ inches
The perimeter of the square is $4s=4(15\text{ in.})=\boxed{60}$ inches.
We can use the distributive property to avoid having to convert our mixed number to a fraction: \begin{align*}
6 \cdot 8\frac{1}{3} &= 6 \cdot \left(8 + \frac{1}{3}\right)\\
&= 48 + 6 \cdot\frac{1}{3}\\
&= 48 + \frac{6}{3}\\
&= 48 + 2\\
&= \boxed{50}.
\end{align*}
The integer is a multiple of three if the sum of its digits is a multiple of three
Since 6 and 3 are both multiples of three, the units digit must also be a multiple of three
The possibilities for this digit are 0, 3, 6, or 9
The greatest possible difference between any two possibilities is $9-0=\boxed{9}$.
Converting all of the given mixed numbers into fractions, we find \begin{align*}
3\frac{1}{5}&=3+\frac{1}{5} =\frac{3 \cdot 5}{5} + \frac{1}{5} =\frac{15}{5} + \frac{1}{5}
=\frac{16}{5},\\
4\frac{1}{2}&=4 + \frac{1}{2}
=\frac{4 \cdot 2}{2} + \frac{1}{2}
=\frac{8}{2} + \frac{1}{2}
= \frac{9}{2}, \\
2\frac{3}{4} &= 2 + \frac{3}{4}
=\frac{2\cdot 4}{4} + \frac{3}{4}
=\frac{8}{4} + \frac{3}{4}
=\frac{11}{4} \\
1\frac{2}{3} &= 1 + \frac{2}{3}
=\frac{1 \cdot 3}{3} + \frac{2}{3}
=\frac{3}{3} + \frac{2}{3}
=\frac{5}{3}.
\end{align*} Substituting, we get $53\cdot \left(\frac{16}{5} - \frac{9}{2}\right) \div \left(\frac{11}{4} + \frac{5}{3}\right) $
We must first compute the expression inside parentheses
In order to add and subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions
For the first set of parentheses, this is $5 \cdot 2 = 10$ and for the second set it is $3 \cdot 4=12$
Thus, we now have  \begin{align*}
53\cdot\left(\frac{16}{5} - \frac{9}{2}\right) \div \left(\frac{11}{4} + \frac{5}{3}\right) &=53\cdot\left(\frac{16 \cdot 2}{5 \cdot 2} - \frac{9 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 5}\right) \\
&\qquad\qquad\qquad\div \left( \frac{11 \cdot 3}{4 \cdot 3} + \frac{5\cdot 4}{3 \cdot 4}\right) \\
&=53\cdot \left(\frac{32}{10} - \frac{45}{10}\right) \div \left(\frac{33}{12} + \frac{20}{12}\right) \\
&=53\cdot\left(\frac{32-45}{10}\right) \div \left(\frac{33 + 20}{12}\right) \\
&=53\cdot\left(\frac{-13}{10}\right) \div \left(\frac{53}{12}\right) \\
&=53\cdot\left(\frac{-13}{10}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{12}{53}\right) \\
&=\cancel{53}\cdot\left(\frac{-13}{\cancelto{5}{10}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\cancelto{6}{12}}{\cancel{53}}\right) \\
&=\left(\frac{-13}{5}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{6}{1}\right)\\
&=\frac{(-13) \cdot (6)}{(5) \cdot (1)} \\
&=\frac{-78}{5} \\
&=-\frac{78}{5}.
\end{align*} When we take 78 divided by 5, we get a quotient of 15 and a remainder of 3
In other words, $78=15 \cdot 5 + 3$
Substituting into our fraction, \begin{align*}
-\frac{78}{5} &= -\frac{15 \cdot 5 + 3}{5} \\
&=-\left(\frac{15 \cdot 5}{5}+\frac{3}{5} \right) \\
&=-\left(\frac{15 \cdot \cancel{5}}{\cancel{5}}+\frac{3}{5} \right) \\
&=-\left(15+\frac{3}{5}\right) \\
&=\boxed{-15\frac{3}{5}}.
\end{align*}
Multiplying both sides by 2 and by 7 to eliminate fractions gives  \[7(c-23) = 2(2c+5).\] Expanding both sides gives $7c - 161 = 4c + 10$
Subtracting $4c$ from both sides gives $3c -161= 10$, and adding 161 to both sides gives $3c = 171$
Finally, dividing by 3 gives $c = \frac{171}{3} = \boxed{57}$.
Since $n$ buses will carry $38n$ students, we need $38n>411$.
Dividing both sides of this inequality by $38$, we have $n>\dfrac{411}{38}$
We can convert $\dfrac{411}{38}$ to a mixed number: $$\frac{411}{38} = \frac{380}{38}+\frac{31}{38} = 10\frac{31}{38}.$$ Since the number of buses must be an integer, the smallest possible number of buses is $\boxed{11}$.
For every ten consecutive integers 1-10, 11-20, and so on until 50, there is one 9 painted
Since there are 5 sets of ten consecutive integers, there are $\boxed{5}$ nines painted.
Each flip can result in either a heads or a tails
Thus, there are two choices for each flip
Since there are eight flips total, $2^8 = \boxed{256}$ distinct sequences are possible.
Prime factorize 315: \begin{align*}
315&=5\cdot63 \\
&= 5\cdot 9\cdot7 \\
&= 5\cdot 3^2 \cdot 7.
\end{align*} The distinct prime factors of 315 are 3, 5, and 7, and their sum is $\boxed{15}$.
We can organize the subtraction concisely using columns as follows:  \[
\begin{array}{@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& 3 & 3 & 3
& 3 & 3 \\
- & 1 & 1 & 1
& 1 & 1
\\ \cline{1-6}
& 2 & 2 & 2
& 2 & 2 \\
\end{array}
\] The answer is $\boxed{222.22}$.
We have $$\cfrac{ \frac{2}{5}+\frac{3}{4} }{ \frac{4}{9}+\frac{1}{6}}=\cfrac{ \frac{8+15}{20} }{ \frac{8+3}{18}}=\frac{23}{20} \times\frac{18}{11}=\frac{23}{\cancelto{10}{20}}\hspace{4mm}\times \frac{\cancelto{9}{18}}{11} =\boxed{\frac{207}{110}}.$$
The sum of the angle measures of an octagon is $180(8-2) = 1080$ degrees, so each angle of a regular octagon measures $1080^\circ/8=135^\circ$
Therefore, $\angle BCD= 135^\circ$, which means $\angle BCP = 180^\circ - \angle BCD = 45^\circ$
Similarly, $\angle PAB = 45^\circ$
Since $\angle ABC = 135^\circ$, the reflex angle at $B$ that is an interior angle of $ABCP$ has measure $360^\circ - 135^\circ = 225^\circ$
The interior angles of quadrilateral $ABCP$ must sum to $360^\circ$, so we have  \begin{align*}
\angle P &= 360^\circ - \angle PAB - (\text{reflex }\angle B) - \angle BCP\\
&=360^\circ - 45^\circ - 225^\circ - 45^\circ = \boxed{45^\circ}.

Note that we also could have solved this problem by noticing that $\overline{FC}\parallel\overline{HA}$, so $\angle APD = \angle FCD$
Since $\overline{CF}\parallel\overline {ED}$, we have $\angle FCD = 180^\circ - \angle CDE = 180^\circ - 135^\circ = 45^\circ$.
A composite number is the product of two smaller natural numbers
If a composite has no prime divisors less than 10, then the smallest that product can be is $11 \cdot 11 = \boxed{121}$.
The median of three integers is the middle integer
So the middle integer is $27$ and the largest integer is $27+5=32$
We also know that if the mean is $26$, then the sum of the three numbers is $26\times3=78$
We subtract the other two numbers to find that the third number is $78-27-32=\boxed{19}$.
We begin by listing the two-digit primes with 1 as the tens digit:
11, 13, 17, 19.
When reversed, the above numbers are 11, 31, 71, and 91
The first three are prime, but 91 is composite (7 times 13), as desired
Hence, our desired prime is $\boxed{19}$.
Let $s$ be the side length of the square and $r$ the radius of the circle
We are given $4s=2\pi r$ and asked to find $s^2/(\pi r^2)$
Squaring both sides of the equation we obtain $16s^2=4\pi^2r^2$
We divide by $16\pi r^2$ to find $s^2/(\pi r^2)=\boxed{\frac{\pi}{4}}$.
There are obviously 24 positive integers less than or equal to 24
Of them, we can count the divisors directly, or use the neat trick of prime factorizing $24 = 2^3 \cdot 3^1$
Considering that any divisor must be of the form $2^a \cdot 3^b$ where $0 \le a \le 3$ and $0 \le b \le 1$ so that there are $4 \cdot 2 = 8$ factors of 24
So, the probability of a positive integer less than or equal to 24 being a factor of 24 is $\frac{8}{24} = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
The positive factors of $50$ are $1, 2,5, 10, 25, 50$

Their sum is $1+5 = \boxed{6}$.
A product is what you get when you multiply things together
To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators together to get the new numerator
So, the numerator is $1\times3=3$.
Then, multiply the denominators together to get the new denominator
$5\times7 = 35$
Therefore our answer is:  \[\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{3}{7} = \boxed{\frac{3}{35}}.\]
We test primes up to 5 as potential divisors and find that there are only $\boxed{2}$ primes, 31 and 37, between 30 and 40.
Let the number of coins Emma received from her parents be $x$
She lost $\frac{1}{2}x$ coins on the way to school
She found $\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{4}{5}x=\frac{2}{5}x$ of the coins by retracing her steps
Thus, Emma has $\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{5}x=\frac{9}{10}x$ coins
She is still missing $x-\frac{9}{10}x=\frac{1}{10}x$ coins, so she is missing $\boxed{\frac{1}{10}}$ of the coins.
The $24$ pies are divided into $1+4+3 = 8$ equal parts
Thus, there are $\frac{24}{8} = 3$ pies per part
Since three parts of the pies are cherry, Alex baked $3 \cdot 3 = \boxed{9}$ cherry pies.
In 5 days, Gage skated for $5 \times 75 =375$ minutes, and in 3 days he skated for $3 \times 90 = 270$ minutes
So, in 8 days he skated for $375 + 270 = 645$ minutes
To average 85 minutes per day for 9 days he must skate $9 \times 85 = 765$ minutes, so he must skate $765-645=\boxed{120}$ minutes = 2 hours the ninth day.
Let the integers be $n$, $n+1$, $n+2$, $n+3$ and $n+4$
Their average is $n+2$, so we have $$n+4<2(n+2) \Rightarrow n+4<2n+4 \Rightarrow 0<n.$$Thus $n$ is at least $\boxed{1}$.
$12=2^2\cdot3$, $18=2\cdot3^2$, and $30=2\cdot3\cdot5$
The prime factorization of a number that is a multiple of these three numbers must have a 2 raised to at least the 2nd power, a 3 raised to at least the 2nd power, and a 5 raised to at least the 1st power
Thus, the $\emph{least}$ common multiple is $2^2\cdot3^2\cdot5=\boxed{180}$.
Each of the 4 corner cubes has 4 red faces
Each of the 8 other cubes on the edges has 3 red faces
Each of the 4 central cubes has 2 red faces
Then, each of the corner cubes and each of the central cubes has an even number of red faces
There are $\boxed{8}$ such cubes.

If $n$ is the number of coins in Paula's purse, then their total value is $20n$ cents
If she had one more quarter, she would have $n+1$ coins whose total value in cents could be expressed both as $20n+25$ and as $21(n+1)$
Therefore \[
20n + 25 = 21 (n+1), \quad \text{so} \quad n=4.
\]Since Paula has four coins with a total value of 80 cents, she must have three quarters and one nickel, so the number of dimes is $\boxed{0}$.
Asking "how many one-fourths are there in 7/2?" is the same as asking "what is 7/2 divided by 1/4?"
Therefore, we want to find $$\frac{7}{2} \div \frac{1}{4}.$$We remember that division by a fraction is the same thing as multiplication by its reciprocal
Also, we know that the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{4}$ is $\frac{4}{1}$
Therefore, we have that $$\frac{7}{2} \div \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{1} = \frac{7 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{28}{2} = 14.$$There are $\boxed{14}$ one-fourths in $\frac{7}{2}$.
Since half the adults were women, there are 1000 women and 1000 men
Thus, $20\%$ of 1000 is 200 women wearing sunglasses, and $9\%$ of 1000 means there are 90 men wearing sunglasses, making for a total of $\boxed{290}$ people wearing sunglasses.
Dividing $350$ by $12$ gives a quotient $29$ with a remainder of $2$
In other words, \[350=12\cdot29+2.\]Thus, $29\cdot12=\boxed{348}$ is the largest multiple of $12$ which is less than $350.$
Multiplying both the numerator and denominator in $\frac{5}{8}$ by $\frac{100}{8}$ yields \begin{align*} \frac{5}{8} &= \frac{5\cdot \frac{100}{8}}{8\cdot \frac{100}{8}}\\ &= \frac{\frac{500}{8}}{100}\\ &= \frac{62.5}{100}\\ &= \boxed{0.625}
\end{align*}
To calculate the average of two numbers, we add them and divide the sum by $2$
From the given information, we have the equation  \[\frac{23+x}{2}=27.\]  Multiplying both sides by $2$ yields \[23+x=54.\]  Thus, $x=54-23=31$
Finally, the positive difference between $31$ and $23$ is \[31-23=\boxed{8}.\]
If one canoe weighs 28 pounds, then three canoes weigh $3\times 28$ pounds, and thus seven bowling balls weigh $3\times 28$ pounds, and thus one bowling ball weighs $\dfrac{3\times 28}{7} = 3\times 4 = \boxed{12}$ pounds.
Since $3/(3+2)=3/5$ of the total amount of paint is red, he will need $\frac{3}{5}\cdot30=\boxed{18}$ cans of red paint.
The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and width
In this case, the perimeter is $2(19+11)=2(30)=60$ feet
Thus, the ratio of the length of the room to its perimeter is $\boxed{19:60}$.
43 is prime
Notice how we can rewrite all the other numbers in the list as sums of smaller numbers which we can then factor: \[4343 = 4300 + 43 = 43(100+1)=43(101)\]and \[ 434343 = 430000 + 4300 + 43 = 43(10000+100+1) = 43(10101).\]We can perform a similar factorization for each subsequent numbers in the list
Thus, none of these numbers are prime, so the only prime number in the list is 43
Hence, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
Since the area of a circle is $\pi \cdot r^2$, where $r$ is the radius, we have the equation $\pi \cdot r^2 = 49\pi$
Solving for $r$, we find that $r=7$, so the radius is $\boxed{7}$ units.
Let $v$ be the volume of soda in Brand Y, and let $p$ be the price of Brand Y soda
Thus, the volume of soda in Brand X is $1.2v$, and the price of Brand X soda is $.9p$.
It follows that the unit price of Brand X soda is $.9p/1.2v = 3p/4v$, and the unit price of Brand Y soda is $p/v$
The ratio of these unit prices is: $$\dfrac{\dfrac{3p}{4v}}{\dfrac{p}{v}} = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.$$

\[ OR \]Each rectangle has perimeter $= 2l + 2w = 2(4) + 2(2) = 8 + 4 = 12$ inches
When the two rectangles are positioned to form the T, a two-inch segment of each rectangle is inside the T and is not on the perimeter of the T
So the perimeter of the T is $2(12) - 2(2) = 24

We find the prime factorization of 210 to be $2\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7$
Noticing that $2 \cdot 3=6$, we have 5, 6, and 7 as consecutive integers whose product is 210
So, our answer is $5+6+7=\boxed{18}$.

If Adam travels east and Simon travels south, then their paths are perpendicular and their distance apart is the hypotenuse of a right triangle
Let $x$ be the number of hours it takes for Adam and Simon to be $60$ miles apart
Then Adam has traveled $8x$ miles and Simon has traveled $6x$ miles
By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have  \begin{align*}
\sqrt{(8x)^2+(6x)^2}&=60\quad\Rightarrow\\
\sqrt{100x^2}&=60\quad\Rightarrow\\
10x&=60\quad\Rightarrow\\
\end{align*}They are $60$ miles apart after $\boxed{6}$ hours.
First, consider the three-digit palindromes
There are $9$ choices for the first digit (the hour): $1$, $2$,..., $9$
There are $6$ choices for the second digit (the tens digit of the minutes): $0$, $1$, ..., $5$
The last digit (the units digit of the minutes) has to be the same as the first digit
So there are $9 \cdot 6 = 54$ three-digit palindromes.
Second, consider the four-digit palindromes
The first digit (the tens digit of the hour) must be $1$
There are $3$ choices for the second digit (the units digit of the hour): $0$, $1$, and $2$
The third digit must be the same as the second digit, and the fourth digit must be the same as the first digit
So there are $3$ four-digit palindromes.
In total, there are $54+3=\boxed{57}$ different palindromes.
A 5-mile taxi ride costs $\$1.50 + 5 \cdot \$0.25 = \$1.50 + \$1.25 = \boxed{\$2.75}.$
There are $8\times 3\times 4=\boxed{96}$ ways to make three decisions if there are 8, 3, and 4 options available for the decisions.
The sum of all five numbers is $5\times 54=270$
The sum of the first two numbers is $2\times 48=96$, so the sum of the last three numbers is $270-96=174$
The average of the last three numbers is $\frac{174}{3}=\boxed{58}$.
To minimize the cost, Rose should place the most expensive flowers in the smallest region, the next most expensive in the second smallest, etc
The areas of the regions are shown in the figure, so the minimal total cost, in dollars,  is \[

$AC = AB + BC = 7$
$BD = AD - AB = 12$
Thus, $AC:BD=\boxed{\frac{7}{12}}$.
Since $0.2 = 2\times 0.1$, we have \[2.4\times 0.2 = 2.4 \times 2\times 0.1 = 4.8\times 0.1 = \boxed{0.48}.\]
Twenty dollars is 2000 cents
Since every page costs 2.5 cents, you can copy $2000/2.5=\boxed{800}$ pages.
There are 15 students, thus, the median is represented by the $8^{th}$ student, who missed 2 days of school
The mean is calculated by: $\frac{3 \times 0 + 1 \times 1 + 4 \times 2 + 3 \times 1 + 4 \times 1 + 5 \times 5}{15} = 2\frac{11}{15}$, making for a difference of $\boxed{\frac{11}{15}\text{ days}}$.
The mode is the number that appears the most often, or $22.$ The median is the number that has half the other numbers greater than it and half less than it, or $31.$ The positive difference between the two is $31-22=\boxed{9}.$
There are 10 possibilities for the first digit
After the first digit has been chosen, there are 9 possibilities for the second digit, and after the first two digits have been chosen there are 8 possibilities for the last digit
The total number of possible settings is $10\cdot 9\cdot 8=\boxed{720}$.
If the ratio of the two complementary angles is 4 to 5, then there are 9 equal parts making up the full 90 degrees
That means each part is 10 degrees, and the two angles are 40 degrees and 50 degrees
When the 40-degree angle is increased by $10\%$, we get 44 degrees
The 50-degree angle must drop down to 46 so that the two angles remain complementary
Dividing 46 by 50, we get 0.92, or $92\%$
The larger angle must decrease by $\boxed{8\%}$.
Suppose each team played just one game with each of the remaining teams
Then each of the nine teams plays eight games
This makes a total of $9 \times 8$ or 72 games
However each game has been counted twice in this total
For example, the game between Team A and Team B appears in A's 8 games and also B's 8 games
Therefore there are $9 \times \frac{8}{2} = 36$ different games played
Since each game is played three times, the total number of games played is $3 \times 36 = \boxed{108}$.
Adding $4.4$ to both sides of the inequality yields $1.2n < 9.6$
Then, dividing both sides by $1.2$ gives $n<8$
The positive integers satisfying this inequality are $n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7$
Their sum is $\boxed{28}$.
There are 16 horizontal segments on the perimeter
Each has length 1, so the horizontal segments contribute 16 to the perimeter.
There are 10 vertical segments on the perimeter
Each has length 1, so the vertical segments contribute 10 to the perimeter.
Therefore, the perimeter is $10+16=\boxed{26}$.
(We could arrive at this total instead by starting at a fixed point and travelling around the outside of the figure counting the number of segments.)
There are $24\times3=72$ hours in three days
Two thousand people moving in 72 hours gives an average rate of $\frac{2000}{72}=\frac{250}{9}=27\frac{7}{9}$ people per hour, which to the nearest person is $\boxed{28}$ people per hour.
Note that, because two or more members can be multiplied, multiplying by $1$ will only make a difference if it is one of two numbers
Thus, multiplying by $1$ adds four potential numbers.
Now, we only need to consider the number of combinations that can be made from $2$, $3$, $5$, and $11$.
Choosing two from this set offers six possiblities: $2 \cdot 3$, $2 \cdot 5$, $2 \cdot 11$, $3 \cdot 5$, $3 \cdot 11$, and $5 \cdot 11$.
Choosing three offers four possibilities: $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$, $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 11$, $2 \cdot 5 \cdot 11$, and $3 \cdot 5 \cdot 11$.
Finally, there is one possibility with four chosen: $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 11$
Thus, there are $4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = \boxed{15}$.
Remembering proper order of operations, first simplify the terms in the parentheses using the quotient of powers rule:
$12^{12} \div 12^{11} = 12^{12-11} = 12$ so that the expression becomes  \[(12^2 \cdot 4^2) \div 2^4 = 12^2 \cdot 4^2 \div 2^4.\] Since $4^2 = 4 \cdot 4 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 2^4$, we have \[12^2 \cdot 4^2 \div 2^4 = 12^2 \cdot 1 = \boxed{144}.\]
We begin by multiplying both sides of the inequality by $15$, so as to get rid of denominators: $$15\cdot \frac{x}{3} + 15\cdot \frac{4}{5} < 15\cdot\frac{5}{3},$$which simplifies to $$5x + 12 < 25.$$Subtracting $12$ from both sides gives $5x<13$, then dividing both sides by $5$ gives $x<2\frac35$
The largest integer $x$ satisfying this inequality is $\boxed{2}$.
We want to transform the numbers to a sequence from 1 to $N$, which is easy to count
First, we reverse the list to become $39,42,\ldots,144,147$
Then we divide each number by 3 since the numbers are spaced 3 apart to get $13,14,\ldots,48,49.$  Finally, we subtract 12 from all of the numbers to get $1, 2, \ldots, 37.$  So there are $\boxed{37}$ numbers.
There are 6 choices of shirt, 3 choices of pants, and 5 choices for either wearing one of the 4 ties or not wearing a tie at all, so the total number of outfits is $6 \times 3 \times 5 = \boxed{90}$.
We begin by realizing that $0.\overline{1}=0.\overline{11}$, so $0.\overline{1}+0.\overline{01}=0.\overline{11}+0.\overline{01}=0.\overline{12}$
(Note that this can be done because there is no carrying involved.)
To express the number $0.\overline{12}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $100x$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&100x &=& 12&.121212\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.121212\ldots \\
\hline
&99x &=& 12 &
\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\overline{12} = \frac{12}{99}$.
But that isn't in lowest terms, since $12$ and $99$ share a common factor of $3$
We can reduce $\frac{12}{99}$ to $\boxed{\frac{4}{33}}$, which is in lowest terms.
Multiplying by $5$, we have $\frac53<x<\frac{25}8$
Writing this with mixed numbers, we have $1\frac23 < x < 3\frac18$, so the possible integer values for $x$ are $2$ and $3$
Of these, the larger value is $\boxed{3}$.
(Note that only the second inequality matters here
We deal with the first inequality merely to show that there actually are integers satisfying both inequalities!)
First, we add the two numbers
\[ \begin{array}{@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 8 & 1
& 7 & 6 & \\ +& & 3 & 4
& 5 & 8 & 7\\ \cline{1-7}& 1 & 1 & 6
& 3 & 4 & 7\\ \end{array} \]In order to round the result, $116.347$, to the nearest tenth, we must consider the hundredths place
The hundredths digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so the tenths place remains $3$
The answer after rounding is thus $\boxed{116.3}$.
We could list them: DOG, DGO, ODG, OGD, GDO, GOD
Or we could have noticed that we have 3 ways to pick the first letter, 2 ways left to pick the second, and 1 way to pick the third, for a total of $3\cdot2\cdot 1 = \boxed{6}$ ways.
We are trying to count the number of terms in the sequence $2000,$ $2001,$ $2002,$ $\ldots,$ $2998,$ $2999.$ If we subtract $1999$ from every term in the sequence it becomes $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $\ldots,$ $999,$ $1000.$ So, there are $1000$ positive integers with $4$ digits and thousands digit $2.$
We could note that there are $10$ choices for each of the digits besides the thousands digit, so there are $$10\times10\times 10=\boxed{1000}$$ positive integers with thousands digit $2.$
Let $n$ be the number of sides in the polygon
The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees
Since each angle in the given polygon measures $140^\circ$, the sum of the interior angles of this polygon is also $140n$
Therefore, we must have  \[180(n-2) = 140n.\] Expanding the left side gives $180n - 360 = 140n$, so $40n = 360$ and $n = \boxed{9}$.
We might also have noted that each exterior angle of the given polygon measures $180^\circ - 140^\circ = 40^\circ$
The exterior angles of a polygon sum to $360^\circ$, so there must be $\frac{360^\circ}{40^\circ} = 9$ of them in the polygon.
For a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by $9$
Thus, the least and greatest numbers in the range from $150$ to $300$ that are divisible by nine are $153$ and $297$
So, we must count the numbers in the list  \[9\cdot 17, 9\cdot 18, 9\cdot 19, \ldots, 9\cdot 33.\] This list has the same number of numbers as the list \[17, 18, 19,\ldots, 33.\] Subtracting 16 from each of these gives  \[1,2,3,\ldots,17.\] There are clearly $\boxed{17}$ numbers in this list.
Integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 must be multiples of 15
We can start by listing the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200: $$15,30,45,60,75,90,105,120,135,150,165,180,195$$ Checking only the even numbers, we can eliminate those that are multiples of 4, leaving us with: $$15,30,45,75,90,105,135,150,165,195$$ Finally, we need to eliminate any remaining multiples of 7
The only multiples of 7 we need to be concerned with are those ending in 5 or 0
The only number on the list that is a multiple of 7 is 105
Our final list is: $$15,30,45,75,90,135,150,165,195$$ This leaves us with $\boxed{9}$ integers.
The positive divisors of $12$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6,$ and $12.$ Of these factors, $3$ is a divisor of $3, 6,$ and $12.$ We have a total of $\boxed{3}$ possible values of $a.$
Since $\overline{AD}\parallel \overline{FG}$, we have $\angle CFG + \angle CEA = 180^\circ$, so $1.5x + (x+2x) = 180^\circ$
Simplifying gives $4.5x = 180^\circ$, so $9x = 360^\circ$ and $x = 40^\circ$
Therefore, $\angle EFG = 1.5(40^\circ) = \boxed{60^\circ}$.
There are 12 total slices, and 6 of them have pepperoni and 10 have mushrooms
Let $n$ be the number of the slices that have both toppings, so there are $6-n$ with just pepperoni and $10-n$ with just mushrooms
Since every slice has at least one topping, and there are 12 slices, we must have $(6-n) + (10-n) + n = 12$, which gives $n=\boxed{4}$.
Using a common deminator of 8, $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{8} = \frac{2}{8} + \frac{3}{8} = \boxed{\frac{5}{8}}$.
Have the youngest sit first, then the next youngest, and so on
The first person has 5 choices
No matter where the first person sits, the next person has 4 choices
No matter where the first two people sit, the third person has 3 choices
The fourth person then has 2 choices
Therefore, there are $5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2 = \boxed{120}$ ways for the four people to sit.
Two-thirds of Jar A's original $4+8=12$ buttons is 8 buttons
Therefore, four buttons were removed from Jar A: two red buttons and two blue buttons
So the probability that the button drawn from Jar A is red is $\frac{2}{8}$ and the probability that the button drawn from Jar B is red is $\frac{2}{4}$
Therefore, the probability that both buttons are red is $\dfrac{2}{8}\cdot\dfrac{2}{4}=\boxed{\frac{1}{8}}$.
Let the measure of the larger angle be $3x$
Then the measure of the smaller angle is $2x$, and because the angles are complementary we have $3x+2x=90^\circ$
It follows that $x=90^\circ/5=18^\circ$, so the measure of the smaller angle is $2x=\boxed{36}$ degrees.
Since the triangle is isosceles, the length of $AB$ is also 6cm
The area of the triangle is then $(AB\cdot AC)/2=(6\cdot6)/2=\boxed{18}$ square centimeters.
Discounting a $\$100$ item by $50\%$ reduces the price to $50\%(\$100)= \$50$
Discounting the $\$50$ price by $30\%$ reduces it to $70\%(\$50)=\boxed{35}$ dollars.
All three integers must be divisors of $7^3$
The only divisors of $7^3$ are $7^0$, $7^1$, $7^2$, $7^3$
We have $7^3=7^0\times7^1\times7^2$
Thus our answer is $7^0+7^1+7^2=1+7+49=\boxed{57}$.
Since there are $3$ people who took home pieces of $\frac{6}{7}$ of a pie, we must divide $\frac{6}{7}$ by $3$
\frac{6}{7} \div 3 = \frac{6}{7} \div \frac{3}{1} = \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6 \cdot 1}{7 \cdot 3} = \frac{6}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{7} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\] Therefore Louie, Duey, and Huey each took home $\frac{2}{7}$ of a pie, and as such, Louie took home $\boxed{\frac{2}{7}}\text{ of a pie}$.
Obviously, there are $6$ one-topping pizzas.
Now we count the two-topping pizzas
There are $6$ options for the first topping and $5$ options left for the second topping for a preliminary count of $6\cdot5=30$ options
However, the order in which we put the toppings on doesn't matter, so we've counted each combination twice, which means there are really only $\dfrac{6\cdot5}{2}=15$ two-topping pizzas.
Adding our answers, we see that there are $6+15=\boxed{21}$ possible pizzas with one or two toppings.
Because the first term of the expression, 12/30, is not simplified, we simplify before continuing, \[
\frac{12}{30} = \frac{6}{6}\cdot\frac{2}{5} = 1\cdot\frac{2}{5} = \frac{2}{5}.
\]However, the two terms have different denominators, so we have to find a common denominator, \[
\frac{2}{5} - \frac{1}{7} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{7}{7} - \frac{1}{7} \cdot \frac{5}{5} = \frac{14}{35} - \frac{5}{35} = \boxed{\frac{9}{35}}.
\]The answer is in simplest form.
We are looking for $\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{8}$
The least common denominator is 8, so we must rewrite $\frac{3}{4}$ with 8 in the denominator
$\frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot 1 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{2} = \frac{6}{8}$
Then, we know that $\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6-1}{8} = \boxed{\frac{5}{8}}$.
The smallest set of such prime numbers is $5,7,11,13$, making a sum of $\boxed{36}$.
Any nonzero number raised to the zeroth power is $\boxed{1}.$
Subtracting $3x+9$ from both sides of the first equation gives $-14=7x$
Dividing both sides of this equation by 7 shows that $x=-2$
Substituting this value of $x$ into $4(x+7)$ gives $4(-2+7)=4(5)=\boxed{20}$.
Since 1 piece of gum costs 1 cent, then 1000 pieces of gum cost 1000 cents.
Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the total cost is $\boxed{10.00}$ dollars.
Because $AB=BC=EA$ and $\angle A = \angle B = 90^\circ$, quadrilateral $ABCE$ is a square, so $\angle AEC = 90^\circ$.
pair A,B,C,D,G;
A=(0,10); B=(10,10);
C=(10,0); D=(5,-7.1);

[/asy]
Also $CD=DE=EC$, so $\triangle CDE$ is equilateral and $\angle CED =
60^\circ$
Therefore \[
\angle E = \angle AEC + \angle CED =
90^\circ + 60^\circ = \boxed{150^\circ}.
A circle of diameter 20 inches has radius 10 inches
Thus the difference in the areas of these two circles is $20^2\pi - 10^2\pi = \boxed{300\pi}$ square inches.
Remember, $10^n$ is $1$ followed by n zeros
Now, in order to count the zeros, we must express $1000^{100}$ in the form of $10^n$
Notice that $1000 = 10^3$, so $1000^{100} = (10^3)^{100} = 10^{300}$, by the power of a power rule
Now, it is obvious that $1000^{100}$ is $1$ followed by $\boxed{300}$ zeros.
In order for the number $273{,}1A2$ to be divisible by $4,$ the last two digits must be divisible by $4.$ The multiples of $4$ less than $100$ that end with the digit $2$ are $12,$ $32,$ $52,$ $72,$ and $92.$ This gives us five possibilities for $A$: $1,$ $3,$ $5,$ $7,$ and $9.$
Of these, all but the number $5$ are divisors of $63,$ so we have that $A$ could be $1,$ $3,$ $7,$ or $9.$ Therefore, there are $\boxed{4}$ values of $A$ such that $63$ is divisible by $A$ and $273{,}1A2$ is divisible by 4.
First, quantify the number of marbles each person has:
$\bullet$ Angela has $a$ marbles.
$\bullet$ Brian has $2\times a$ marbles.
$\bullet$ Caden has $3\times(2\times a)$ marbles.
$\bullet$ Daryl has $5\times(3\times(2\times a))$ marbles.
In total, the four people have $a+2\times a+3\times(2\times a)+5\times(3\times(2\times a))$ marbles
And that expression equals 78, since in total the four people have 78 marbles
Now evaluate the resulting equation
\begin{align*}
78&=a+2\times a+3\times(2\times a)+5\times(3\times(2\times a))\\
&=a+2a+3(2a)+5(3(2a))\\
&=a+2a+6a+5(6a)\\
&=a+2a+6a+30a\\
&=39a \quad\implies\\
a&=\boxed{2}.
\end{align*}
The sum of all ages is $40\times 17=680$
The sum of the girls' ages is $20\times 15=300$ and the sum of the boys' ages is $15\times 16=240$
The sum of the five adults' ages is $680-300-240=140$
Therefore, their average is $\frac{140}{5}=\boxed{28}$.
Adding $2x$ to both sides, we have \[ -7 = 9x + 2.\]Then, subtracting 2 from both sides, we have $-9 = 9x$, so $x = \boxed{-1}$.
There are three roots and five minerals, meaning $3 \cdot 5 = 15$ possible combinations of roots and minerals
However, two of them are not valid, therefore there are $15 - 2 = \boxed{13}$ possible ways in which the sorcerer can brew his potion.
There are 4 ways to choose which to visit first, then 3 ways to choose which to visit next, then 2 ways to choose where to go after that, and then 1 way to choose where to go last
This gives a total of $4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1 = \boxed{24}$ possible orders.
7 players are taking biology, so $12 - 7 = 5$ players are not taking biology, which means 5 players are taking chemistry alone
Since 2 are taking both, there are $5 + 2 = \boxed{7}$ players taking chemistry.
Drawing an altitude of an equilateral triangle splits it into two 30-60-90 right triangles: [asy]
unitsize(0.6inch);
pair A, B, C, F;
A = (0,1);
B = rotate(120)*A;
C = rotate(120)*B;
F = foot(A,B,C);
draw(A--B--C--A,linewidth(1));
draw(A--F);
label("$A$",A,N);
label("$B$",B,S);
label("$C$",C,S);
label("$M$",F,S);
[/asy]
The altitude is the longer leg of each 30-60-90 triangle, so $AM = \sqrt{3}\cdot BM$ in the diagram above
Since $AM = \sqrt{6}$, we have \[BM = \frac{AM}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{\frac63} = \sqrt{2}.\] Therefore, we have $BC = 2BM = 2\sqrt{2}$, so the area of the triangle is $(BC)(AM)/2 = (2\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{6})/2
=\sqrt{12} = \boxed{2\sqrt{3}}$ square units.
Since $ABC$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, we have $AB = AC\sqrt{3} = 6\sqrt{3}$, and  \[[ABC] = \frac{(AB)(AC)}{2} = \frac{(6)(6\sqrt{3})}{2} = \frac{36\sqrt{3}}{2} = \boxed{18\sqrt{3}}.\]
Notice how 4 inches = 1/3 foot and 6 inches = 1/2 foot, so both the width and length will be tiled with full tiles (i.e
no tiles have to be broken)
Since all tiles remain whole, we can calculate the number of tiles by dividing the total floor area by each tile's area
Doing so yields \[\frac{9 \text{ ft} \cdot 12\text{ ft}}{4 \text{ inches} \cdot 6 \text{ inches}} = \frac{9 \text{ ft} \cdot 12\text{ ft}}{1/3 \text{ ft} \cdot 1/2 \text{ ft}} = \boxed{648}.\]Hence, we need $\boxed{648}$ tiles to cover the floor.
Label the feet of the altitudes from $B$ and $C$ as $E$ and $F$ respectively
Considering right triangles $AEB$ and $DFC$, $AE = \sqrt{10^2 - 8^2} = \sqrt{36} = 6\text{ cm}$, and $FD =
\sqrt{17^2-8^2} = \sqrt{225} = 15\text{ cm}$
So the area of $\triangle AEB$ is $\frac{1}{2}(6)(8) = 24 \text{ cm}^2$, and the area  of $\triangle DFC$ is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) (15)(8) = 60 \text{ cm}^2$
Rectangle $BCFE$ has area $164 - (24 + 60) = 80 \text{ cm}^2$
Because $BE = CF = 8$ cm,  it follows that $BC = \boxed{10\text{ cm}}$

Multiplying both sides by 2 and by 5 to eliminate the fractions gives \[5(r-45) = 2(3-2r).\] Expanding both sides gives $5r - 225 = 6-4r$
Adding $4r$ and 225 to both sides gives $9r = 231$, so $r = \frac{231}{9} = \boxed{\frac{77}{3}}$.
To average $83\%$ over four quarters, a student must earn a total of $4 \times 83 = 332$ percentage points
So far Fisher has $82 + 77 + 75 = 234$ percentage points
He needs another $332 - 234 = 98$ percentage points, so he must earn a $\boxed{98\%}$ in the 4th quarter.
We want to find the lowest integer $x$ such that: \begin{align*}
50+9x&<14x \quad \Rightarrow \\
50&<5x \quad \Rightarrow \\
10&<x.
\end{align*}The least integer greater than 10 is $\boxed{11}$.
The area of the entire grid in the diagram is 38
(We can obtain this either by counting the individual squares, or by dividing the grid into a 2 by 3 rectangle, a 3 by 4 rectangle, and a 4 by 5 rectangle.)
The area of shaded region is equal to the area of the entire grid minus the area of the unshaded triangle, which is right-angled with a base of 12 and a height of 4
Therefore, the area of the shaded region is $$38 - \frac{1}{2}(12)(4)=38-24=\boxed{14}.$$
Substituting $x=2$ and $y=1$ into the expression $2 \times x-3 \times y,$ we have $2\times2-3\times1.$  Using the correct order of operations, $$2\times2-3\times1=4-3=\boxed{1}.$$
Since there are 24 hours in a day, there are $12\cdot24$ hours in 12 days
One hour of music takes up $1/(12\cdot24)$ of the disk space that 12 days takes up, so one hour of music takes up $16000/(12\cdot24)=500/(3\cdot3)\approx\boxed{56}$ megabytes.
The area of the two squares are $(2x)^2=4x^2$ square inches and $(5x)^2=25x^2$ square inches, and the area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(2x)(5x)=5x^2$ square inches
We solve \[
25x^2+4x^2+5x^2=850
\] to find $x=\pm\sqrt{850/34}=\pm5$
We take the positive solution $x=\boxed{5}$.
The difference between $44r$ and $90r$ is $90r-44r=\boxed{46r}$.
Since $\overline{AB}\parallel\overline{CD}$, we have $\angle AXE = \angle CYX$
Letting $x = \angle AXE$, we have $x = 3x - 108^\circ$
Solving this equation gives $x = 54^\circ$
We therefore have $\angle BXY = \angle AXE = \boxed{54^\circ}$.
If $2k$ is the number of girls in Angie's class, then $3k$ is the number of boys
The total number of students is $2k+3k=5k$
Solving $5k=20$ gives $k=4$, so there are $2(4)=\boxed{8}$ girls in Angie's class.
The sum of the areas of the squares is $PR^2+PQ^2+QR^2$
By the Pythagorean theorem, $PR^2=PQ^2+QR^2$
Substituting the left-hand side of this equation for the right-hand side, we find that the sum of the areas of the squares is $PR^2+PR^2=2\cdot PR^2$
Setting this equal to 338 square centimeters, we find that $PR^2=338/2=\boxed{169}$ square centimeters.
To find the average, we take the total sum and divide by the number of terms: $\frac{100+200+150+150}{4}=\frac{600}{4}=150$
The average monthly balance is $\boxed{\$150}$.
First, convert quarts to pints
$1$ quart is $2$ pints, so $2$ quarts is $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ pints
So, it takes $4$ pints of milk to bake $12$ cookies
Because the proportion of milk to cookies is constant, divide both the pints of milk and the number of cookies by $4$ to obtain that $\boxed{1}$ pint of milk is needed to bake $3$ cookies.
The area of the 10-inch pizza is $5^2\pi = 25\pi$ square inches, while the area of the 12-inch pizza is $6^2\pi = 36\pi$ square inches
The increase is $36\pi-25\pi=11\pi$
As a factor, this is an increase of $\frac{11\pi}{25\pi} = \frac{44}{100} = \boxed{44\%}$.
The prime factorization of 84 is $2^2 \times 3 \times 7$, the prime factorization of 112 is $2^4 \times 7$, and the prime factorization of 210 is $2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7$
The greatest common factor of the three numbers is the product of all the prime factors that they have in common, which is $2 \times 7 = \boxed{14}.$
Suppose we list the angle measures in increasing order
Let $x$ be the measure of the middle angle in degrees
Then, the five angles have measures $x -2^\circ$, $x-1^\circ$, $x$, $x + 1^\circ$, and $x+2^\circ$
The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so \[(x -2^\circ)+(x-1^\circ)+(x)+(x + 1^\circ) +(x+2^\circ) = 540^\circ.\] Simplifying the left side gives $5x = 540^\circ$, and dividing both sides by 5 gives $x = 108^\circ$
Therefore, the largest angle has measure $x + 2^\circ = \boxed{110^\circ}$.
The number of school days until they will next be together is the least common multiple of $3$, $4$, $6$, and $7$
Since $3$, $4 = 2^2$, and $7$ are all powers of different primes, the least common multiple of these prime powers is $3 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 7 = 84$
The number $6$ also happens to be a factor of $84$, so $\boxed{84}$ is the least common multiple of $3$, $4$, $6$, and $7$.
Simplify, remembering the exponents take priority over multiplication and multiplication takes priority over addition or subtraction
\begin{align*}
5^3-3\times 5^2+3\times5-1&=125-3\times25+15-1 \\
&=125-75+14 \\
&= 50+14 \\
&= \boxed{64}.
\end{align*}
Let $p$ be the number of pizzas he bought
He makes $10p$ dollars selling $p$ pizzas, but he spends $3p$ dollars on gas
Therefore, we have \begin{align*}
10p-3p &\ge 5000 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad 7p &\ge 5000 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad p &\ge \frac{5000}{7} \\
\Rightarrow\qquad p &\ge 714\frac{2}{7}.
\end{align*}Therefore, John must sell at least $\boxed{715}$ pizzas to earn back the $\$5000$ he spent on the car.
We use the fact that division is the same as multiplication by a reciprocal to write  \[
(9 \times 10^8) \div (3 \times 10^3) = (9 \times 10^8) \cdot \frac{1}{3 \times 10^3}.
\] Next we use the property $\frac{1}{xy} = \frac{1}{x} \cdot \frac{1}{y}$ for nonzero $x$ and $y$ to obtain \[
(9 \times 10^8) \cdot \frac{1}{3 \times 10^3} = 9 \cdot 10^8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{10^3}.
\] Now we can apply the commutative property of multiplication to arrange these factors in a way that allows us to use our exponent rules
We get  \[
9 \cdot 10^8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{10^3} = 9 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot 10^8 \cdot \frac{1}{10^3}.
\] Again using the fact $x\cdot \frac{1}{y} = x \div y$, this expression becomes  \[
9 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot 10^8 \cdot \frac{1}{10^3} = (9 \div 3) \cdot (10^8\div 10^3)
\] We can simplify $9\div 3 = 3$ and $10^8 \div 10^3 = 10^{8-3}=10^5$ using the quotient-of-powers rule, which tells us that $a^{m} \div a^{n} = a^{m-n}$ for any number $a$ and any positive integers $m$ and $n$ with $m$ greater than $n$
So our final answer is  \[
(9\div 3) \cdot (10^8 \div 10^3) = 3 \cdot 10^5 = \boxed{300,\!000},
\] where we have used the fact that $10^5$ is 1 followed by 5 zeros.
Let the size of the apartment be $s$
The cost will be $0.9s$
The maximum comes when this is $630$, so

The chart shows the amounts of sales at the end of each year
Therefore we're looking for a year on the chart that has the largest difference from the previous year
Determining the sales that increased the most number of dollars is equivalent to finding the right endpoint of the segment with the steepest slope
From observation, we can determine that that line corresponds to the year $\boxed{1998}$.
Triangle $XYZ$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, so $ZY = XY\sqrt{2}$, which means $XY = \boxed{12}$.
If $s$ is the side of the square, then $s^2=400$
Therefore, $s=20$
The perimeter is $4(20)=\boxed{80}$ cm.
There are two choices for the letter, followed by ten choices of a digit for each of the next five slots
Thus, there are $2 \cdot 10^5 = \boxed{200000}$ combinations.
Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the vertices of the right triangle corresponding to the 60, 90, and 30 degree angles, respectively
Also, let $F$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to the hypotenuse $AC$
Notice that $\bigtriangleup BAF$ is a 30-60-90 triangle
The longer leg of a 30-60-90 is $\sqrt{3}$ times the shorter leg, so $AF=3/\sqrt{3}=\sqrt{3}$ units
The hypotenuse of a 30-60-90 triangle is twice the shorter leg, so $AB=2\sqrt{3}$ units
Since $\bigtriangleup CAB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle as well, $BC=2\sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{3}=6$ units
The area of $ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2}(\text{base})(\text{height})=\frac{1}{2}(2\sqrt{3})(6)=\boxed{6\sqrt{3}}$ square units.

(1/5)(250) = 50, so out of 250 Americans, $\boxed{50}$ are expected to have allergies.
We begin by expressing $0.\overline{09}$ and $0.\overline{7}$ as common fractions.
To express the number $0.\overline{09}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $100x$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&100x &=& 9&.090909\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.090909\ldots \\
\hline
&99x &=& 9 &
\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\overline{09} = \frac{9}{99} = \frac{1}{11}$.
We can do a similar trick to express $0.\overline{7}$ as a fraction
Call this number $y$ and subtract it from $10y$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&10y &=& 7&.77777\ldots \\
- &y &=& 0&.77777\ldots \\
\hline
&9y &=& 7 &
\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\overline{7} = \frac{7}{9}$.
Therefore, $(0.\overline{09})(0.\overline{7})=\frac{1}{11} \cdot \frac{7}{9} = \boxed{\frac{7}{99}}$.
Recall that $\frac{a}{b}$ means the same as $a \div b.$ Applying this rule with $a=3$ and $b=6/11$, we get \[
\frac{3}{\frac{6}{11}} = 3\div \frac{6}{11}.
\] Now remember that dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, and the reciprocal of $\frac{6}{11}$ is $\frac{11}{6}$
We get \[
3 \div \frac{6}{11} = 3\cdot \frac{11}{6} = \frac{3\cdot 11}{6} = \frac{3}{6} \cdot 11 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 11 =\boxed{\frac{11}{2}}.
There are a total of 10 people at the party
Each shakes hands with everyone else, except for their spouse, which will be a total of $10-2=8$ other people
The total number of handshakes will be $10\cdot8/2=\boxed{40}$, where we divide by 2 to correct for counting each handshake twice.
There are six sections in which the spinner can come to rest, and it is equally likely that it will come to rest in each of the sections
Thus, the probability that it will come to rest in one of the two shaded regions is $\frac{2}{6} = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
The mean of a set of numbers is the sum of those numbers divided by the total number of numbers
The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$, and there are 3 angles
Hence their mean is $\frac{180^\circ}{3} = \boxed{60^\circ}$.
Since the weight of $7$ oranges is equal to the weight of $5$ apples, Jimmy needs only $5$ apples for every $7$ oranges in order for their weight to be equal
So Jimmy needs $\frac{5}{7} \times 28=\boxed{20}$ apples.
Note: Read the problem carefully! It does not say that the ratio of the number of oranges to apples is 7:5
It says the ratio of the weight of oranges to apples is 7:5
This is a huge difference!

Each page is assigned two numbers
We can generalize the numbers assigned to page $x$ to be the pair $x$ and $54-x$ for $1 \leq x \leq 53$
That is, if $x = 1$, then we can see that page number one is assigned the numbers $1$ and $54-1 = 53$
It is fairly easy to see that the units digits of $x$ and $54-x$ will only be the same if $x$ has a units digit of $2$ or a units digit of $7$
Thus, we simply must count how many such $x$ there are between $1$ and $54$
Possibilities for $x$ are: 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, and 52
Therefore, there are $\boxed{11}$ such pages.
We compute that \[\frac{2^2 \cdot 2^{-3}}{2^3 \cdot 2^{-2}} = \frac{2^{2 - 3}}{2^{3 - 2}} = \frac{2^{-1}}{2^1} = 2^{-1 - 1} = 2^{-2} = \frac{1}{2^2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}.\]
Since $17^2=289<300$ and $18^2=324>300$, the least integer greater than $\sqrt{300}$ is $\boxed{18}$.
To round $54.\overline{54}$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question
We write it as \[54.\overline{54} = 54.5454\overline{54}.\]Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $4$ rounds up to $5$
Therefore, $54.\overline{54}$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\boxed{54.55}$.
The list starts as $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $4,$ $5,$ $6.$
If Carolyn removes $2,$ then Paul removes the remaining positive divisor of $2$ (that is, $1$) to leave the list $3,$ $4,$ $5,$ $6.$ Carolyn must remove a number from this list that has at least one positive divisor other than itself remaining
The only such number is $6,$ so Carolyn removes $6$ and so Paul removes the remaining positive divisor of $6$ (that is, $3$), to leave the list $4,$ $5.$ Carolyn cannot remove either of the remaining numbers as neither has a positive divisor other than itself remaining.
Thus, Paul removes $4$ and $5.$
In summary, Carolyn removes $2$ and $6$ for a sum of $2+6=\boxed{8}$ and Paul removes $1,$ $3,$ $4,$ and $5$ for a sum of $1+3+4+5=13.$
Bob must pay $200$ yen, which we can multiply by the conversion factor $\frac{1\ \text{USD}}{108\ \text{yen}}$ to obtain the value in U.S
dollars
Carrying out the calculation, we find that Bob must use $200\ \text{yen} \cdot \frac{1\ \text{USD}}{108\ \text{yen}} \approx \boxed{1.85\ \text{USD}}$ for the coffee.
Between them, Allen and Ben are dividing the work into $8$ equal parts, $3$ of which Allen does and $5$ of which Ben does
Each part of the work requires $\frac{240}{8} = 30$ square feet to be painted
Since Ben does $5$ parts of the work, he will paint $30 \cdot 5 = \boxed{150}$ square feet of the fence.
We have:

[/asy] Rectangle $ABCG$ has area $8\times 9=72$, so rectangle $FEDG$ has area $72-52=20$
The length of $\overline{FG}$ equals $DE=9-5=4$, so the length of $\overline{EF}$ is $\frac{20}{4}=5$
Therefore, $DE+EF=4+5=\boxed{9}$.
In general, to express the number $0.\overline{n}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&10x &=& n&.nnnnn\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.nnnnn\ldots \\
\hline
&9x &=& n &
\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\overline{n} = \frac{n}{9}$.
Hence, our original problem reduces to computing $\frac 89 + \frac 29 = \boxed{\frac{10}{9}}$.
The other leg is $\sqrt{25^2-24^2}=\sqrt{625-576}=\sqrt{49}=7$

We notice that 77 is a multiple of 7

The ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow is $(40\text{ feet})/(10\text{ feet})=4$, so Andrea is $4\times 15\text{ inches}=\boxed{60}$ inches tall.
The original nine numbers, with mean 54, must have a sum of $9 \cdot 54 = 486$
After including $u$ and $v$, we have eleven numbers now, and their sum must be $11 \cdot 66 = 726$
Since the only new numbers in this sum are $u$ and $v$, $u+ v = 726 - 486 = 240$
So, the mean of $u$ and $v$ is $\frac{1}{2}(u+v) = \frac{1}{2}(240) = \boxed{120}$.
Before summing up the prices, we need to take into account that the price of the pineapples has changed from $\$4$ to $\$4\div2=\$2$
Now we can use multiplication and addition to find the total cost

&=\$5+\$10+\$9+\$4+\$7\\
&=(\$5+\$10)+(\$9+\$4+\$7)\\
&=\$15+\$20\\
&=\$35.
\end{align*}Notice how we used the commutative property of addition to rearrange the numbers and the associative property of addition to rearrange the numbers so that the arithmetic is easier.
Now, since Judy's order is over $\$25$, we need to take into account her coupon
Subtracting $\$5$ from the computed cost gives us  $$\$35-\$5=\$30.$$Judy spent $\boxed{\$30}$ on this shopping trip.

By the Pythagorean Theorem in $\triangle ADB,$ $BD^2 = BA^2 - AD^2 = 13^2 - 5^2 = 144,$ so $BD=12\text{ cm}.$
By the Pythagorean Theorem in $\triangle DBC,$ $BC^2 = DC^2 - BD^2 = 20^2 - 12^2 = 256,$ so $BC=16\text{ cm}.$
Since $BCED$ has three right angles (and in fact, a fourth right angle at $E$), then it is a rectangle, so $DE=BC=16\text{ cm}$ and $CE=BD=12\text{ cm}.$
Therefore, if we look at $\triangle AEC,$ we see that $AE = 16+5=21\text{ cm},$ so by the Pythagorean Theorem, $AC^2 = 21^2 + 12^2 = 585,$ so $AC \approx \boxed{24.2}\text{ cm},$ to the nearest tenth of a centimeter.
There are one odd and two even numbers showing
Because all primes other than 2 are odd and the sum of an even number and an odd number is odd, the common sum must be odd
That means 2 must be opposite 59 and the common sum is $2+59=61$
The other two hidden numbers are $61-44=17$ and $61-38 = 23$
The average of 2, 17 and 23 is $\frac{2+17+23}{3}=\frac{42}{3}=\boxed{14}$.
We look for the least number of workers $n$ such that the cost is less than the revenue in a day of work
The cost of each worker is $\$15$ per hour, while the revenue that comes from each worker hired is $\$3.10\times5$ widgets per hour
\begin{align*}
500+8(15n)&<(8)(3.1)(5)n=124n\quad\Rightarrow\\
500+120n&<124n\quad\Rightarrow\\
500&<4n\quad\Rightarrow\\
125&<n.
\end{align*}The smallest integer greater than 125 is 126, so the company has to hire at least $\boxed{126}$ workers to make a profit.
$1C3$ is a multiple of 3 if and only if the sum of the digits, $1+C+3$, is a multiple of 3
Plugging in each possible digit for $C$ gives us that $1+C+3$ is a multiple of 3 only for $C=2, 5, 8$
Thus, $1C3$ is a multiple of 3 for $\boxed{3}$ digits $C$.
Problem 5
Let's call the side length of the square $s$
This makes the perimeter of the square $4s$, which we know is 144 units
Solving $4s = 144$ for  $s$, we get $s = 36$
We also can say that the perimeter of each rectangle is $2(s + 0.25s)$
Since we found that $s = 36$, we know that the perimeter of each rectangle is $2(36 + (0.25)(36)) = \boxed{90\text{ units}}$.
To make lemonade, I need a total of $7 + 1 = 8$ parts liquid
Because I am making a gallon of lemonade, each part must be $\frac{1}{8}$ of a gallon
Converting to quarts gives that each part is $\frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$ of a quart
Since I have $7$ parts water, I therefore need $7 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{7}{2}}$ quarts of water.
There are four choices for the hundreds digit: 1, 2, 3, or 4
The tens digit is unrestricted; it could be any one of the five
Finally, the units digit can only be a 2 or 4
Thus, there are $4 \cdot 5 \cdot 2 = \boxed{40}$ such numbers that can be formed.
In this problem we are choosing a committee, so the order in which we choose the 3 people does not matter
We could have chosen them in any of the following orders (where A is Alice, B is Bob, and C is Carol): ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA
So each possible committee corresponds to $3! = \boxed{6}$ possible orderings.
You can directly calculate the square root of 729, but it helps to know that $729 = 9^3 = 3^6 = 27^2$, so $x = \boxed{27}$.
Since $\angle AFG=\angle AGF$ and $\angle GAF+\angle
AFG+\angle AGF=180^\circ,$ we have $20^\circ +2(\angle
AFG)=180^\circ.$ So $\angle AFG=80^\circ.$ Also, $\angle AFG+\angle
BFD=180^\circ,$ so $\angle BFD=100^\circ.$ The sum of the angles of $\triangle BFD$ is $180^\circ,$ so $\angle B+\angle D=\boxed{80^\circ}.$
Note: In $\triangle AFG,$ $\angle AFG=\angle B+\angle D.$ In general, an exterior angle of a triangle equals the sum of its remote interior angles
For example, in $\triangle GAF,$ $\angle AFE =\angle
GAF+\angle AGF.$
The area of the square is $AD^2$
By the Pythagorean theorem applied to triangle $ABC$, we have $AC^2=36+9=45$ square units
By the Pythagorean theorem applied to triangle $ACD$, we have $AD^2=16+45=\boxed{61}$ square units.
If 0.25 inches represents 3 miles, we have that 1 inch represents 12 miles
Therefore, 15 inches represents $\boxed{180\text{ miles}}$.
Recall that $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{n} = \frac{a^{n}}{b^{n}}$, so the expression is equivalent to $\frac{1^{4}}{2^{4}}=\frac{1}{2^{4}} = \boxed{\frac{1}{16}}.$
Since 1.5 Australian dollars are worth 1 American dollar, 1 Australian dollar is worth $\dfrac{1}{1.5}=\dfrac{2}{3}$ American dollars
Therefore, the number of American dollars of damage was $$\left( \dfrac{2}{3} \right) (30,\!000,\!000)=\boxed{20,\!000,\!000}.$$
The first figure has a perimeter of 18 and the second a perimeter of 14, so the difference is $18-14=\boxed{4}$.
If $s$ is the side of the square, $s^2 = 325$, so $s = \sqrt{325} = \sqrt{65 \cdot 5} = \sqrt{13 \cdot 25} = 5\sqrt{13}$
The perimeter is $4s$, or $\boxed{20\sqrt{13}}$.
Sixty percent of the plane's 200 passengers is $200\cdot \frac{60}{100} = 120$ passengers
Ten percent of these women are in first class; this is $120\cdot \frac{10}{100} = \boxed{12}$.
Clearly there are 5 choices for the first letter
Although it is tempting to think that there are 4 choices for the second letter, reading the problem carefully, we see that in the process of picking our five letters, we will never run out of any of our vowels, since there are five sets of each vowel
Therefore, we just multiply 5 by itself five times to get $5^5 = \boxed{3125}.$
Since division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, $\frac{~\frac{2}{5}~}{\frac{3}{7}} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{7}{3} = \frac{2\cdot7}{5\cdot3}$ = $\boxed{\frac{14}{15}}$.
Listing the prime factors of $39$ and $91$, we have $39 = 3 \cdot 13$ and $91 = 7 \cdot 13$
The only prime common to both factorizations is $13$ (raised to the $1$st power), so the greatest common divisor must be $\boxed{13}$.
We have the ratio $5 \text{ pounds}:\$4$
Multiplying both sides of the ratio by 3 does not change the ratio
Doing so, we get $15 \text{ pounds}:\$12$
Thus, 15 pounds of apples costs $\boxed{12}$ dollars.
There are $20$ positive multiples of $5$ less than $101$
There are $14$ positive multiples of $7$ less than $101$
However, the least common multiple of $5$ and $7$ is $35$, and there are $2$ positive multiples of $35$ less than $101$
This means there are $20 - 2 = 18$ multiples of $5$ that aren't multiples of $7$, and $14 - 2 = 12$ multiples of 7 that aren't multiples of $5$, for a total of $18 + 12 = \boxed{30}$.
The sum of the areas of the two squares is $AE^2+AB^2$
By the Pythagorean theorem applied to right triangle $BAE$, we have $AE^2+AB^2= BE^2 = \boxed{81}$ square units.
When working with unit conversion, it's easiest to think of the units as variables themselves.
In this problem, the unit we begin with is inches, and we want to end up with centimeters
Nonetheless, we don't want to change the quantity, only the units -- we must look for a ratio of units which is equal to one.
Since $1 \mbox{ inch} = 2.54 \mbox{ cm}$, we can divide by sides by 1 inch to find  $$\frac{2.54\mbox{ cm}}{1\mbox{ in}} = 1.$$
So, Auston is $$60\mbox{ in} \cdot \frac{2.54 \mbox{ cm}}{1 \mbox{ in}} = \boxed{152.4}\mbox{ cm}$$ tall.
Let I, II, and III denote the areas of the triangles as shown on the diagram
The area of $\Delta ABC$ can be obtained by subtracting I+II+III from the area of the rectangle.
I $= 4 \times 2/2 = 4$, II $= 5 \times 2/2 = 5$, III = $1 \times 4/2 = 2$; I+II+III $= 4+5+2 = 11$.
Subtracting these areas from the area of the large rectangle tells us that the area of $ABC$ is $4\cdot 5 - 4-5-2 = \boxed{9}$ square units.

Suppose the total cost is $x$ dollars
Then we have that the cost for each the original 3 friends was $\frac{x}{3}$, while after the 2 extra friends joined, the cost was $\frac{x}{5}$ per person
So the given information translates into $\frac{x}{3} - 11.00 = \frac{x}{5}$
Solving for $x$, find: \begin{align*}
\frac{x}{3}-11&=\frac{x}{5}\\
\Rightarrow\qquad \frac{x}{3}-\frac{x}{5}&=11\\
\Rightarrow\qquad \frac{5x-3x}{15}&=11\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x&=\frac{15}{2}\cdot11=\boxed{82.50}
\end{align*}
Combining the like terms on both sides, we obtain $3x = 400 - 7x$
Adding $7x$ to both sides yields $10x = 400$
Dividing both sides by 10 yields $x = \boxed{40}$.
Since there are eight rays forming congruent central angles and the sum of these angles is equal to 360 degrees, each central angle is $360/8=45$ degrees
Since the angle between the East ray and the Southwest ray includes 3 of these central angles, the angle is $45\cdot3=\boxed{135}$ degrees.
We have \begin{align*}
AB+BC+CD+DE+EF+FG+GA&=\\
4+4+2+2+1+1+1&=\boxed{15}\\
\end{align*}
Since the average of four numbers is $4,$ their sum is $4 \times 4 = 16.$
For the difference between the largest and smallest of these numbers to be as large as possible, we would like one of the numbers to be as small as possible (so equal to $1$) and the other (call it $B$ for big) to be as large as possible.
Since one of the numbers is $1,$ the sum of the other three numbers is $16-1=15.$
For the $B$ to be as large as possible, we must make the remaining two numbers (which must be different and not equal to $1$) as small as possible
So these other two numbers must be equal to $2$ and $3,$ which would make $B$ equal to $15-2-3 = 10.$
So the average of these other two numbers is $\dfrac{2+3}{2}=\dfrac{5}{2}$ or $\boxed{2\frac{1}{2}}.$
Eduardo wants to make twice as many cookies as the recipe makes
Therefore, he must double the amount of flour required: $(2\text{ cups})\times2=\boxed{4}$ cups.
The prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3
If the greatest common factor with 18 is 3, that means the other number is a multiple of 3 but not 2, 6, or 9
Since the other number cannot be an even number (multiple of 2), we start with 99 and look at decreasing odd numbers
99 is a multiple of 9, 97 and 95 are not multiples of 3, so the greatest integer less than 100 that satisfies the conditions is $\boxed{93}$.
There are 3 ways to choose the first digit, 2 ways to choose the second after the first has been chosen, and 1 way to choose the third after the first two have been chosen, for a total of $3\cdot2=\boxed{6}$ possibilities.
Recall that $(-a)^{n}=a^n$ for even $n$ and $(-a)^{n}=-a^n$ for odd $n$
This means that $(-2)^{3}=-2^{3}$, $(-2)^2=2^2$, and $(-2)^1=-2^1.$ Additionally, any number added to its opposite is equal to zero, so $-2^3+2^3=0$
Now we can use the commutative property of addition to obtain  \begin{align*}
(-2)^{3}+(-2)^{2}&+(-2)^{1}+2^{1}+2^{2}+2^{3}\\
&=-2^{3}+2^{2}+(-2^{1})+2^{1}+2^{2}+2^{3}\\
&=-2^{3}+2^{3}+(-2^{1})+2^{1}+2^{2}+2^{2}\\
&=0+2^{2}+2^{2}\\
&=4+4\\
&=\boxed{8}.
\end{align*}
The hour hand is $40/60=2/3$ of the way from the 9 to the 10 on the clock, which the minute hand is on the 8
Between any two numbers on the clock there are $360/12=30$ degrees
Thus, the angle between the two hands is $30+30(2/3)=\boxed{50}$ degrees.
$8 = 2^3$, $15 = 3^1 \cdot 5^1$, so lcm$[8, 15] = 2^3 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 = \boxed{120}$.
Notice that, since 8 and 15 have no common factors (greater than 1), their least common multiple is equal to their product.
The lengths of the top/bottom interior edges are $5-2=3$ inches (since there is 1 inch of frame to either side of the interior rectangular hole)
Let the lengths of the left/right interior edges be $x$ inches
Then, the lengths of the left/right exterior edges are $x+2$ inches
The area of the frame is equal to the area of the frame rectangle minus the area of the hole
This is equal to $5\cdot(x+2)-3x=2x+10$
Since we are given that this area is 18 square inches, we have the equation $2x+10=18\Rightarrow x=4$
So the dimensions of the interior hole are $3\times4$
Thus, the sum of the four interior edges is $3+4+3+4=\boxed{14}$ inches.
Since the square has side length $2/\pi$,  the diameter of each circular section is $2/\pi$
The boundary of the region consists of  4 semicircles, whose total perimeter is twice the circumference of a  circle having  diameter $2/\pi$
Hence the perimeter of the region is \[
2\cdot \left(\pi\cdot \frac{2}{\pi}\right) = \boxed{4}.
Let us first count the handshakes between two gremlins
There are $20$ gremlins, so there must be $\dfrac{20 \cdot 19}{2} = 190$ handshakes between two gremlins, making sure to divide by two to avoid over-counting.
Meanwhile, there are $15$ imps that shake hands with each of the $20$ gremlins, which makes $15 \cdot 20 = 300$ handshakes between imps and gremlins.
Adding them up, we have $300 + 190 = \boxed{490}$ total handshakes.
Multiply 3 miles per hour by 1.5 hours to find that Shari walks $\boxed{4.5}$ miles.
The first round reduced the number of students by $\frac{1}{2}$ and the second round reduced the number of students by $\frac{1}{3}$
After both reductions, $\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{6}$ of the students who began the contest remain
Therefore, $24\cdot6=\boxed{144}$ students began the contest.
Notice that $0.\overline{72} = 72 \cdot 0.\overline{01}$ and $0.\overline{27} = 27 \cdot 0.\overline{01}.$ Our expression easily simplifies to \begin{align*}
\frac{0.\overline{72}}{0.\overline{27}} &= \frac{72 \cdot 0.\overline{01}}{27 \cdot 0.\overline{01}} \\
&= \frac{\cancelto{8}{72}\hspace{2mm}}{\cancelto{3}{27}\hspace{2mm}} \cdot \frac{\cancel{0.\overline{01}}}{\cancel{0.\overline{01}}} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{8}{3}}.

We first simplify the expression on the left hand side of the equation:  $$
\frac{13x}{41y}= \frac{ {\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)}^2 + {\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)}^2 }{ {\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)}^2 + {\left( \frac{1}{5} \right)}^2}
= \frac{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{9}}{\frac{1}{16}+\frac{1}{25}}
= \frac{\frac{9+4}{9\cdot 4}}{\frac{16+25}{16\cdot25}}
= \frac{13/36}{41/400}.
$$ Since dividing by a fraction is the same thing as multiplying by its reciprocal, we have that $\frac{13x}{41y}=\frac{13}{36}\cdot \frac{400}{41}=\frac{13 \cdot 400}{36 \cdot 41}$
We can then multiply both sides of the equation by $\frac{41}{13}$ to get that $\frac{x}{y}=\frac{400}{36}$
Since $\sqrt{x} \div\sqrt{y} = \sqrt{\frac{x}{y}}$, to find $\sqrt{x} \div \sqrt{y}$, we can take the square root of both sides of the equation: $$\sqrt{\frac{x}{y}}=\sqrt{\frac{400}{36}}=\frac{20}{6}=\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}.$$
There are 24 days left, which is 4 times what has already happened
Thus, if Steve keeps all 8 workers, they'll do $4\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{4}{3}$ of the job in these 24 days
He only needs $\frac{2}{3}$ of the job done in these 24 days, or half of $\frac{4}{3}$, so he must keep at least half of his workers: $\boxed{4}$.
Following the order of operations (compute the sum in $(4+8)^2$ before applying the exponent of $(4+8)^2$), we have \begin{align*}
(4+8)^2 + (4^2 + 8^2) &= (12)^2 + (4^2 + 8^2)\\
&= 144 + (16+64) \\
&= 144+ 80 \\
&= \boxed{224}.\end{align*}
The ratio of pencils to cost is $100:\$30$
Multiplying both parts of this ratio by 25 gives a ratio of $2500:\$750$, so 2500 pencils costs $\boxed{\$750}$.
This problem is asking for $\frac{\frac{1}{7}}{\frac{1}{2}}$
(More advanced students can analyze this alternatively by rewriting this worded statement as an equation, we have $x \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{7}$, where $x$ is the fraction of $\frac{1}{2}$ that we are solving for
Dividing both sides by $\frac{1}{2}$, we have $x = \frac{\frac{1}{7}}{\frac{1}{2}}$)
We can simplify this fraction as $\frac{1}{7} \cdot \frac{2}{1}$, since division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal
Multiplying these two fractions then yields $\boxed{\frac{2}{7}}$.
List the first few multiples of 9: $9, 18, 27, 36, \dots$
We see that these are all lucky integers because their digits sum to 9, and the pattern of increasing the first digit by 1 while decreasing the second digit by 1 preserves this property
However, this pattern stops after the last digit reaches zero
Indeed, 90 is still a lucky integer, but 99 is not, since the digits sum to 18 and 99 is not divisible by 18
Thus $\boxed{99}$ is the least positive multiple of 9 which is not a lucky integer.
The sum of the numbers from the first set is $5\cdot 13=65$
The sum of the numbers from the second set is $24\cdot 6 = 144$
The sum of all the numbers in the set is $144+65=209$, so the average of the 11 numbers in the set is $209/11=\boxed{19}$.
The mean of five real numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 5
Therefore, Jeff's average score is $(89+92+88+95+91)/5=\boxed{91}$.
Since $\text{distance}=\text{rate}\times\text{time}$, decreasing speed by a factor of $\frac{6}{7}$ increases the amount of time the trip takes by $\frac{7}{6}$
Therefore, at 60 miles per hour the trip takes $4\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{7}{6}=\frac{9}{2}\cdot\frac{7}{6}=\frac{21}{4}=\boxed{5.25}$ hours.
Rewriting $2^2\cdot 3^4$ as $(2\cdot3^2)^2$ shows us that $\sqrt{2^2\cdot 3^4}=\sqrt{(2\cdot3^2)^2}=2\cdot3^2=2\cdot9=\boxed{18}$.
We simplify the given inequality by adding $x+3$ to both sides, which leaves us with $5x < 5 \Rightarrow x<1$
Since 1 is not less than itself, this leaves us with $x=\boxed{0}$.
First, we list the factors of 63
They are -63, -21, -9, -7, -3, -1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, and 63
Then, we list the factors of 72
They are -72, -36, -24, -18, -12, -9, -8, -6, -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72
By comparing the two lists, we can see that the divisors that 63 and 72 share are -9, -3, -1, 1, 3, and 9
(Notice that these six numbers are the divisors of 9; is this a coincidence?) Therefore, 63 and 72 share $\boxed{6}$ divisors.
We seek the answer to the question "10.5 ounces is 25% of what number?" If we call the unknown number of ounces $x$, we have the equation $10.5=0.25x$
Dividing both sides by $0.25$, we have $x=\frac{10.5}{0.25}=\boxed{42}$ ounces of fiber.
The properties of exponents that need to be used here are product of powers, which states that $a^{m+n}=a^ma^n$ for positive integers $n$, and power of a power, which states that $(a^m)^n=a^{mn}$ for positive integers $n$
Using the product of powers rule, we have \[2^{10} \cdot 2^{15} = 2^{10+15} = 2^{25}.\]Writing $25$ as $5\cdot5$ and using the power of a power rule, we then get \[2^{25} = 2^{5 \cdot 5} = (2^5)^5 = 32^5.\]Thus, the value is $\boxed{32}$.
Two angles are complementary if their degree measures add up to 90 degrees
So if the angle is $x$ degrees, then its complement is $90-x$ degrees
We set up the equation $x=2(90-x)$ and solve for $x$
$$x=180-2x\qquad\Rightarrow3x=180\qquad\Rightarrow x=60$$So the angle has a degree measure of $\boxed{60}$ degrees.
Since I run at a constant pace, we can set up a proportion with one unknown: \begin{align*}
\frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{distance}}&=\frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{distance}}\\
\frac{x}{1\text{ mi}}&=\frac{18\text{ min}}{2\text{ mi}}\\
x&=\frac{18\text{ min}}{2\text{ mi}}\cdot 1\text{ mi}\\
x&=\frac{18\text{ min}}{2}=9\text{ min}\\
x&=\boxed{9\text{ min}}.
\end{align*}
To express the number $3.\overline{7}$ as a fraction, we let $x=3.\overline{7}$, so $10x=37.\overline{7}$ and: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&10x &=& 37&.77777\ldots \\
- &x &=& 3&.77777\ldots \\
\hline
&9x &=& 34&
\end{array}$$ This shows that $3.\overline{7} = \boxed{\frac{34}{9}}$.
To express the number $0.3\overline{25}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $100x$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&100x &=& 32&.5252525\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.3252525\ldots \\
\hline
&99x &=& 32&.2
\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.3\overline{25} = \frac{32.2}{99} = \frac{322}{990} = \boxed{\frac{161}{495}}$.
(Note: This last fraction is in lowest terms, because $161=7\cdot 23$ and $495 = 3^2\cdot 5\cdot 11$.)
For each of the 20 vertices of the polygon, there are 17 other nonadjacent vertices that we can connect the original vertex with to form a diagonal
However, multiplying 20 by 17 would count each diagonal twice---once for each of the diagonal's endpoints
We must divide the result by 2 to correct for this, so the answer is $(20\cdot 17)/2=\boxed{170}$.
After 1.5 hours, or 90 minutes, Jay has walked $0.75 \cdot (90/15) = 4.5$ miles, while Paul has walked $2.5 \cdot (90/30) = 7.5$ miles
Since they are walking in opposite directions, they are $4.5 + 7.5 = \boxed{12}$ miles apart.
Of the 40 who had heart trouble, 20 also had high blood pressure, so there are $40-20=20$ teachers who only have heart trouble
Similarly, there are $70-20 =50$ teachers with only high blood pressure
So, of the 120 teachers total, there are $20 + 20 + 50 = 90$ teachers with one of these two maladies
That means $120-90 = 30$ teachers with neither, which is $\frac{30}{120} = \boxed{25\%}$ of the teachers.

Recalling that "of" means "times," we have \[\frac56\cdot 30 = \frac{5\cdot 30}{6} = 5\cdot \frac{30}{6} = 5\cdot 5 = \boxed{25}.\]We almost might simply have computed \[\frac56\cdot 30 = \frac{5\cdot 30}{6} = \frac{150}{6} = 150\div 6 = \boxed{25}.\]
Let $x$ denote the measure in degrees of $\angle BOC$
Because $\angle BOD$ and $\angle COA$ are right angles, $\angle COD$ and $\angle BOA$ each measure $90-x$ degrees
Therefore $\angle AOD=x+(90-x)+(90-x)$ degrees
Solving \[
3.5x=x+90-x+90-x
\]we find $x=180/4.5=40$
Therefore $\angle AOD=180^\circ-40^\circ=\boxed{140\text{ degrees}}$.
We write the list of five numbers in increasing order
We know that the number $8$ occurs at least twice in the list
Since the median of the list is $9,$ then the middle number (that is, the third number) in the list is $9.$ Thus, the list can be written as $a,$ $b,$ $9,$ $d,$ $e.$
Since $8$ occurs more than once and the middle number is $9,$ then $8$ must occur twice only with $a=b=8.$ Thus, the list can be written as $8,$ $8,$ $9,$ $d,$ $e.$
Since the average is $10$ and there are $5$ numbers in the list, then the sum of the numbers in the list is $5(10)=50.$ Therefore, $8+8+9+d+e=50$ or $25+d+e=50$ or $d+e=25.$
Since $8$ is the only integer that occurs more than once in the list, then $d>9.$ Thus, $10 \leq d < e$ and $d+e=25.$ To make $e$ as large as possible, we make $d$ as small as possible, so we make $d=10,$ and so $e=15.$
The list $8,$ $8,$ $9,$ $10,$ $15$ has the desired properties, so the largest possible integer that could appear in the list is $\boxed{15}.$
Since $(36,25,x)$ is an O'Hara triple, then $\sqrt{36}+\sqrt{25}=x,$ or $x=6+5=\boxed{11}.$
We want to find $0.3 + 29.8$
We know that  $0.3$ is equivalent to $3 \cdot 10^{-1}$, and similarly $29.8$ is equivalent to $29 + 8 \cdot 10^{-1}$
Summing these, we have $(3 \cdot 10^{-1}) + (29 + 8 \cdot 10^{-1})$, which is redistributed as $29 + (3 \cdot 10^{-1} + 8 \cdot 10^{-1}) = 29 + 11 \cdot 10^{-1}$
Simplifying, we have $29 + 1.1 = 29 + 1 + 0.1 = 30 + 0.1 =$ $\boxed{30.1}$.
Substituting $-7$ for $x$, rewrite the given equation as: \begin{align*}
(-7)^2+(-7)+4&=y-4\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 49-7+4&=y-4\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 46&=y-4
\end{align*} Adding four to each side and simplifying, find: $$y=\boxed{50}$$
We can think of placing a $0$ in the fourth box that will necessarily be empty
Now the problem is simple: we have four choices of digits for the first box, three for the second, two for the third, and one for the last
Thus, there are $4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1 = \boxed{24}$ distinct ways to fill the boxes.
Recall that multiplications and divisions should be done before addition
So \begin{align*}3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 + 15 \div 3 &= (3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7) + (15 \div 3) \\ &= 105 + 5 = \boxed{110}.\end{align*}
Let the smaller of the integers be $x$
Then the larger is $x + 2$
So $x + 2 = 3x$, from which $x = 1$
Thus the two integers are 1 and 3, and their sum is $\boxed{4}$.
We treat these inequalities one-at-a-time first
Subtracting 10 from both sides of the first inequality simplifies it to \[n>1.\] To deal with the second inequality, we divide both sides by $-4$, being sure to reverse the inequality sign: \[n<3.\]
Luckily, there is only one integer that solves both of these inequalities, namely $\boxed{2}$.
We first find the fraction of the time that either Amy or Lily wins by adding $\frac{3}{8} + \frac{3}{10}$
Since the least common multiple of $8$ and $10$ is $40$, we write $\frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{5}{5} = \frac{15}{40}$ and $\frac{3}{10} \cdot \frac{4}{4} = \frac{12}{40}$, so our sum is: $$\frac{3}{8} + \frac{3}{10} = \frac{15}{40} + \frac{12}{40} = \frac{15+12}{40} = \frac{27}{40}.$$Since they tie the rest of the time, to find the fraction of the time that they tie, we need to subtract this fraction from $1$
We know that $1 = \frac{40}{40}$, so we have that $$1 - \frac{27}{40} = \frac{40}{40} - \frac{27}{40} = \frac{40-27}{40} = \frac{13}{40}.$$Therefore, Amy and Lily must tie $\boxed{\frac{13}{40}}$ of the time.
Noticing that $ADE$ is a 3-4-5 right triangle scaled by a factor of 2, we have $AD=2 \cdot 5=10$
Thus, the area of square $ABCD$ is $10 \cdot 10=100$
The area of triangle $ADE$ is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 6 \cdot 8=3 \cdot 8=24$
Finally, we calculate the area of pentagon $ABCDE$ to be the difference of the two: $100-24=\boxed{76} \text{ sq units}$.
Perfect squares have an odd number of positive divisors, while all other integers have an even number of positive divisors.
The perfect squares less than or equal to 60 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49
Therefore, of the 59 positive integers less than 60, 7 of them have an odd number of factors, so $59-7=\boxed{52}$ of them have an even number of factors.
If the area formed by 6 congruent squares is 294, the area formed by one of these squares is $294/6 = 49$
Thus, the side of each square is 7.
There are 8 horizontal sides and 6 vertical sides in the perimeter, for a total of 14 sides
Thus, the perimeter of this region is $14\cdot 7 = \boxed{98}$.
Replacing $y$ with $18$, we have $\dfrac{x}{18} = \dfrac{10}{4}$
Multiplying both sides of the equation by $18$, we have $x=\frac{10}{4}\cdot 18=\frac{180}{4}= \boxed{45}$.
First, we look for factors that are in both the numerator and the denominator
Since $6$ and $8$ are both even, we can take out a factor of $2.$ We can also cancel a factor of $x$ and a factor of $y$ since they each appear in both the numerator and the denominator
This leaves us with \[\frac{\cancelto{4}{8}\cancel{x}y^{\cancel{2}}}{\cancelto{3}{6}x^{\cancel{2}}\cancel{y}}=\frac{4y}{3x}.\]Now we substitute $x=2$ and $y=3$ to get $\frac{4\cdot \cancel{3}}{\cancel{3}\cdot 2}=\frac{4}{2}=\boxed{2}.$
Juan can measure the diameter as a length anywhere between $20 - 20\cdot 0.2 = 16$ and $20 + 20\cdot 0.2 = 24$  cm
The actual area of the circle is $\pi (20/2)^2=100\pi$ square cm, but Juan can compute the area anywhere in the range $\pi (16/2)^2=64 \pi$ square cm to $\pi (24/2)^2=144 \pi$ square cm
Using the lower bound of the range, Juan's error is $(100\pi - 64\pi)/(100\pi)=36\%$
Using the upper bound of the range, Juan's error is $(144\pi - 100\pi)/(100\pi)=44\%$
Thus, the largest possible percent error is $\boxed{44}$ percent.
Let $x$ be the original price of the stock
This means that the price of the stock is $1.25x$ at the end of 2006
The original price is $\frac{x}{1.25x} = 80$ percent of this price, so the stock must decrease by $\boxed{20}$ percent.
Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle whose hypotenuse is AD and whose legs are dashed in the diagram below, we find that the side length of the square is $AD=\sqrt{(3\text{ cm})^2+(1\text{ cm})^2}=\sqrt{10}$ centimeters
Therefore, the area of the square is $(\sqrt{10}\text{ cm})^2=10$ square centimeters and the perimeter of the square is $4\sqrt{10}$ centimeters
The product of these two values is $\left(10\text{ cm}^2\right)(4\sqrt{10}\text{ cm})=\boxed{40\sqrt{10}}$ cubic centimeters

[/asy] We have that $AE=BC=8$
Then, $DE=DC-5=20-5=15$
Now, we can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find $AD$
$$AD^2=8^2+15^2=289=17^2$$ $$AD=\boxed{17}$$
The tens digit cannot be 2, 5, or 8 because otherwise, the sum of the digits, and thus the number itself, is divisible by 3
The remaining possibilities are 17, 37, 47, 67, 77, and 97
Only $77=7\cdot11$ is composite, so there are $\boxed{5}$ two-digit prime numbers that have a units digit of 7.
No square shares more than two vertices with the equilateral triangle, so we can find the number of squares having two of their vertices at two given points and triple the result
Given 2 points, 3 squares may be drawn having these points as vertices
The figure below shows a red equilateral triangle with the 3 squares that correspond to one of the sides of the triangle
Therefore, $\boxed{9}$ squares share two vertices with the equilateral triangle

If an exterior angle has measure $120$ degrees, an interior angle has measure $60$ degrees
A regular polygon with $60$ degree angles must be an equilateral triangle, so the perimeter is $3(5)=\boxed{15}$ units.
Since more than half the employees are Administrative Specialists, the median salary will be an administrative specialist, thus, $\boxed{\$23{,}000}$.
Of the $40$ students, $12$ did not like either dessert
Therefore, $40-12=28$ students liked at least one of the desserts
But $18$ students said they liked apple pie, $15$ said they liked chocolate cake, and $18+15=33,$ so $33-28=\boxed{5}$ students must have liked both of the desserts.
Each small square has the same area so we need only divide the number of shaded squares by the total number of squares
There are $13$ of the former and $25$ of the latter, so the answer is $\frac{13}{25}=\boxed{52\%}$.

[/asy] Because $ABC$ is isosceles, $BD$ is perpendicular to $AC$ and it bisects $AC$
Thus, $AD=\frac{48}{2}=24$
Now we see $ABD$ is a 7-24-25 right triangle, so $BD=7$
Calculating the area of $ABC$, we get $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 48 \cdot 7=24 \cdot 7=\boxed{168} \text{sq cm}$.
Dividing 380 by 21 gives a quotient of 18 with a remainder of 2
Therefore, $21 \cdot 18$ is the largest multiple of 21 that is less than or equal to 380, and $21 \cdot 19 = \boxed{399}$ is the least positive multiple of 21 that is greater than 380.
We know that $0.4$ is equivalent to $4 \cdot 10^{-1}$, and similarly $0.6$ is equivalent to $6 \cdot 10^{-1}$
Multiplying these two numbers, we have $(4 \cdot 10^{-1}) \cdot (6 \cdot 10^{-1})$, which can be rearranged as $(4 \cdot 6) \cdot (10^{-1} \cdot 10^{-1})$
This simplifies to $24 \cdot (10^{-2})$, which is $\boxed{0.24}$.
Since $70\%(10)+40\%(30)+60\%(35)=7+12+21=40$, she answered 40 questions correctly

The number of students who selected milk will be $\frac{20\%}{60\%}=\frac{1}{3}$ of the number of students who selected soda

We can create six equilateral triangles with side length one: 176, 172, 273, 657, 574, and 473.
We can also create two equilateral triangles with side length $\sqrt{3}$: 135 and 246.
Thus, there are $\boxed{8}$ such equilateral triangles.
Since the arithmetic mean of these expressions is 24, we can write the expression for the mean: \begin{align*}
\frac{(x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)}{5}&=24\\
\Rightarrow \qquad (x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)&=5\cdot 24
\end{align*}
Combining like terms on the left, we find $5x+40=120$, so $5x=80$, from which we have $x=16$
Our final answer is $\boxed{16}$.
Let the number be $x$
We are told that $\frac{3}{2} x = 30$, so multiplying both sides by $\frac{2}{3}$ gives $x = \boxed{20}$.
We are asked to solve $27+2x=39$ for $x$
We subtract 27 from both sides and then multiply both sides by $\frac{1}{2}$: \begin{align*}
27+2x&=39 \\
2x &= 12 \\
x &= \boxed{6}.
\end{align*}
When $y$ is nonzero, we have $(-x)\div (-y) = x\div y$, so \[(-64)\div (-32) = 64\div 32= \boxed{2}.\]
Since $20$ students have a lunch box, $10$ students do not have a lunch box
So at most $10$ students with brown eyes do not have a lunch box, and at least $\boxed{2}$ students with brown eyes must have a lunch box.
If the width goes from 2 inches to 8 inches, it has been multiplied by 4
If the picture is enlarged proportionately, then the height will also be multiplied by 4
Therefore, the enlarged logo is $1.5\times4=\boxed{6}$ inches tall.
If any linear dimension (such as radius, side length, height, etc.) of a two-dimensional figure is multiplied by $k$ while the shape of the figure remains the same, the area of the figure is multiplied by $k^2$
Since the new diameter is 2 times the original diameter, the new area is $2^2=4$ times the old area
Therefore, the ratio of original area to new area is $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
There are four possible ways the plywood can be cut: all the cuts are parallel to the length, all the cuts are parallel to the width, one cut is parallel to the length and one parallel to the width, or two cuts are parallel to the width and one is parallel to the length
In the first way, the congruent rectangles have dimensions $2\times4$, for a perimeter of $2+2+4+4=12$ feet
In the second way, the congruent rectangles have dimensions $1\times8$, for a perimeter of $1+1+8+8=18$ feet
In the third and fourth ways, the rectangles have dimensions $2\times4$, for a perimeter of 12 feet
The positive difference between the greatest perimeter and the least is $18-12=\boxed{6}$ feet.
There are $24-10=14$ students taking algebra only and $11$ students taking drafting only
So there are $14+11=\boxed{25}$ students taking algebra or drafting but not both.
We need to look for a common factor of 4 and 8 to cancel
4 and 8 are both divisible by 4 so we can cancel 4 from the numerator and denominator of the fraction
\[\frac{4k+8}{4}=\frac{4\cdot(1k+2)}{4\cdot1}=\frac{4}{4}\cdot\frac{1k+2}{1}=\frac{1k+2}{1}\] Dividing by one leaves an expression the same, so the it is now $1k+2$
Checking the form that the answer should be expressed in, we can see that $1k+2$ is of the form $ak+b$ with $a$ and $b$ integers, since 1 and 2 are both integers
So we divide 1 by 2 to get $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$ .
We combine like terms on the left side to find $2x=100$
Dividing by 2 gives $x=\boxed{50}$.

There are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour mark is $360^\circ/12 = 30^\circ$ from its neighbors
At 2:30, the minute hand points at the 6, while the hour hand is mid-way between the 2 and the 3
Therefore, the hour hand is $\frac12\cdot 30^\circ = 15^\circ$ from the 3 on the clock, and there are $3\cdot 30^\circ = 90^\circ$ between the 3 and the 6 on the clock
So, the hour and the minute hand are $15^\circ + 90^\circ =\boxed{105^\circ}$ apart.
We check odd numbers between $30$ and $50$ and find that the prime numbers are $31,37,41,43,47$
There are $\boxed{5}$ prime numbers between $30$ and $50$.
Let the number of lefty jazz lovers be $x$
So $8-x$ lefties dislike jazz and $15-x$ jazz lovers are righties
Since the number of righty jazz dislikers is 2 and the total number of members of the club is 20, we can add these four exclusive categories to get $x + (8 - x) + (15 - x) + 2 = 20$, so $x = \boxed{5}$, which is the number of lefty jazz lovers.
Let $n$ be the original number
Doing Juan's operations in order, we get $(2(n + 2) - 2)/2 = 7$
So $2(n + 2) - 2 = 14$, from which $2(n + 2) = 16$, from which $n + 2 = 8$, giving $n = \boxed{6}$.
Every positive multiple of $32$ is $32\cdot x$ for some positive integer $x$
The smallest multiple is therefore going to be when $x$ is the smallest positive integer which is $1$
So, $32\cdot1=\boxed{32}$ is the smallest multiple of $32$.
The perimeter of a square with side length $x$ units is $4x$ units
The circumference of a circle with radius 2 units is $2\pi (\text{radius})=2\pi(2)=4\pi$ units
Setting $4x=4\pi$, we find $x=\pi$
To two decimal places, $\pi=\boxed{3.14}$.
Divide by $2$ over and over again to get the prime factorization $3328=2^8\cdot13$

We know that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, thus, we can set: \begin{align*}
2x + 3 &= 9

\end{align*}Thus, $2x = 6 \rightarrow x = 3$, and $8y = 8 \rightarrow y = 1$, thus $x + y = \boxed{4}$.
They have the same perimeter, but that is divided among 4 sides for a square, and 3 sides for an equilateral triangle, and thus, the triangle's side length is $\frac{4}{3}$ times as long as that of the square.
To be more precise, you can call $t$ the side length of the equilateral triangle, and $s$ the side length of the square, and set up the equations: $3t = 12$, and $4s = 12$, which yields $t = 4$, and $s = 3$, from which it is clear that the ratio of the side length of the triangle to that of the square is $\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}$.
We know that Sara used 3/10 rolls on three presents, so to find the amount of wrapping paper she used on one present, we need to divide 3/10 by 3
We remember that division by a number is the same thing as multiplication by its reciprocal
Also, the reciprocal of $3$ is $\frac{1}{3}$
Therefore, we have $$\frac{3}{10} \div 3 = \frac{3}{10} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3 \cdot 1}{10 \cdot 3} = \frac{3}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{10}.$$Sara used $\boxed{\frac{1}{10}}$ of a roll of wrapping paper on each present.
The diagonals of a rhombus divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles
The legs of these right triangles are half as long as the diagonals of the rhombus
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the half-diagonals of a rhombus is equal to the square of the side length
Since one of the half-diagonals is $24$, the other half-diagonal is $\sqrt{51^2-24^2}=3\sqrt{17^2-8^2}=3\cdot15=45$
Therefore, the length of the missing diagonal is $45\cdot 2=\boxed{90}$ units.
A number 10 less than an even perfect square cannot be prime, so let's check odd perfect squares greater than 10:
$\bullet$ $5^2=25,$ $25-10=15,$ composite.
$\bullet$ $7^2=49,$ $49-10=39,$ composite.
$\bullet$ $9^2=81,$ $81-10=71.$
Checking prime numbers up to $7$ $($the  largest prime less than $\sqrt{71})$ as potential divisors, we  see that $71$ is prime
Thus, the smallest prime that is $10$ less  than a perfect square is $\boxed{71}.$

The median of 10 positive integers is the average of the fifth and sixth integers

The six other players on the team averaged $3.5$ points each
The total of their points was $6\times 3.5=21.$ Vanessa scored the remainder of the points, or $48-21=\boxed{27}$ points.
If the width of the rectangular playground is $w$, then the length is $2w + 25$
A perimeter of 650 feet means the semi-perimeter is 325 feet
The width plus the length equals the semi-perimeter, so $w + 2w + 25 = 325$
That means $3w = 300$, so $w = 100$ feet
The length must be $2 \times 100 + 25 =
The area of the playground is $100 \times 225 = \boxed{22,500}$ square feet.
We get  \[
2.24 = 2 + \frac{24}{100} = 2 + \frac{6}{25} = \frac{50}{25} + \frac{6}{25} = \boxed{\frac{56}{25}}.

The height of the water initially in feet is $$(18 \text{ inches})/(12 \text{ inches/foot})=1.5\text{ feet}.$$ The amount of water in the basement initially is $$1.5\cdot24\cdot32=1152\text{ cubic feet}.$$ Converting this to gallons, we have $$(1152 \text{ ft}^3)\cdot(7.5 \text { gallons/ft}^3)=8640 \text{ gallons}.$$ If each pump can pump out 8 gallons of water per minute, then three pumps can pump out $8\cdot3=24$ gallons a minute
So it will take $$(8640 \text{ gallons})/(24 \text{ gallons/minute})=\boxed{360}$$ minutes to pump out all the water.
Let the age of the oldest child be $x$

Set $4x-15$ equal to $20-3x$ to find \begin{align*}
4x-15&=20-3x \\
7x&=35 \\
\end{align*} Substituting $x=5$ into either $4x-15$ or $20-3x$, we find that the side length of the square is 5 meters and its area is $(5\text{ m})^2=\boxed{25}$ square meters.
Calculating the numerator first, $\dfrac{3 \times 4}{6} = \dfrac{12}{6} = \boxed{2}$.
If a number is divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits is divisible by 9
The digit sum is $3+A+A+1=2A+4$
Trying different values of $A$ to see what they make the digit sum, we see that no values of $A$ make $2A+4$ divisible by 9 except for $A=7$
We see that $4+2A=18$, so $A=\boxed{7}$.
Since $3(-2)=\nabla+2$, then $-6 = \nabla+2$ so $\nabla = -6-2=\boxed{-8}$.
Since $\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{CD}$, we know that $\angle AXF + \angle FYD = 180^\circ$, so $\angle FYD = 180^\circ - 118^\circ = \boxed{62^\circ}$.
Recall that $(-a)^n=-a^n$ when $n$ is odd so we can rewrite $(-5)^5$ as $-5^5$
Because $a^m\div a^n=a^{m-n}$ for positive integers $m>n$, we get $$-5^5\div5^3=-5^{5-3} =-5^2.$$ Now we can rewrite the expression to get  \begin{align*}
(-5)^5\div5^3+3^{4}-6^{1}&=-5^2+3^4-6\\

Bill is required to get at least 1 of each of the 4 kinds
Once he has done that, he has two donuts left to buy with no restrictions
He can do this by buying 2 of the same kind, which can be done in 4 ways, or he can do this by buying two donuts which are different kinds
If he buys donuts of different kinds, there are 4 options for the type of the first donut and 3 options for the second donut, but since the order that he selects them in doesn't matter we need to divide by two to get to a final count of $\dfrac{4\cdot3}{2}=6$ ways to buy two distinct donuts
This gives us a total of $6+4=10$ ways to buy the last 2 donuts once he has bought one of each kind, so $\boxed{10}$ is our answer.
Multiplying both sides of the inequality by $7$, we have $$2\frac13 + n < 7.$$Subtracting $\frac73$ from both sides gives $$n < 4\frac23.$$The largest integer satisfying this inequality is $n=\boxed{4}$.

There are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour mark is $360^\circ/12 = 30^\circ$ from its neighbors
At 5:00, the minute hand points at the 12, while the hour hand points at hour 5
So, the angle between the hands is $5\cdot 30^\circ = \boxed{150^\circ}$.
In order to cut all three ropes into equal length pieces, the length of the pieces must be a factor of each of the three rope lengths
The prime factors of 39 are $3\cdot13$, those of 52 are $2^2\cdot13$, and those of 65 are $5\cdot13$
The only factor that all three rope lengths share is $\boxed{13}$, so that must be the length of each piece.
The prime factorization of $24$ is $2^3\cdot3$, so $2$ and $3$ have to be prime factors of Bob's number as well
The smallest possible number is when each the exponents of both of them is $1$, giving $2\cdot3=\boxed{6}$.
First we isolate $x$ by subtracting 5 from both sides
This gives \[-4x>12.\]Dividing by $-4$ and remembering to reverse the inequality gives us  \[x<-3.\]The greatest integer that solves this inequality is $\boxed{-4}$.
We can check this
If we substitute $-4$ into the inequality we get  \[5-4(-4)>17\]or  \[5+16>17.\]This is true
If we substitute $-3$ we get  \[5+12>17,\]which is false.
Let's look at the numerator of the big fraction first
To add $\frac{1}{3}$ to $\frac{1}{4}$, we must first find a common denominator
In this case, it's $12$
So \[\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1\cdot4}{3\cdot4} + \frac{1\cdot3}{4\cdot3} = \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{4+3}{12} = \frac{7}{12}.\]Similarly, looking at the denominator of the big fraction, we must again find a common denominator
In this case, it's $30$
So we have \[\frac{2}{5}-\frac{1}{6} = \frac{12}{30} - \frac{5}{30} = \frac{7}{30}.\]Now, the remainder of the problem is to find $\frac{~\frac{7}{12}~}{\frac{7}{30}}$
Remembering that dividing is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, we get \[\frac{~\frac{7}{12}~}{\frac{7}{30}} = \frac{7}{12} \times \frac{30}{7} = \frac{30}{12}.\]But $\frac{30}{12}$ can be written as $\frac{6\cdot5}{6\cdot2}$, so our answer simplifies to $\boxed{\frac{5}{2}}$.
Subtract 90 from every score to simplify the arithmetic
For the average of 6 scores to be 3, their sum must be $6\times3=18$
The sum of her first five scores is $2+5-3-1+10=13$, so the sixth score should be $18-13=5$
Adding 90 back, her score should be $\boxed{95}$.
Mark has $\frac{3}{4}$ of a dollar, or $75$ cents.
Carolyn has $\frac{3}{10}$ of a dollar, or $30$ cents.
Together, they have $75+30=105$ cents, or $\boxed{\$1.05}.$
At each corner of the street, Sam runs 40 more feet than Sarah
Otherwise, Sam runs the same distance as Sarah
Since there are four corners, Sam runs $40\cdot4=\boxed{160}$ more feet than Sarah does.
Let the other leg have length $x$
From the area of the triangle, we have $\frac12(24)(x) = 120$, so $12x = 120$ and $x=10$
Let $c$ be the hypotenuse of the triangle
The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $c^2 = 10^2 + 24^2 = 100 + 576 = 676$, so $c = 26$
Therefore,  the perimeter is $10+24+26=\boxed{60}$.
Let's substitute the given values into the expression
We get  \begin{align*}
(a^3+b^3)\div(a^2-ab+b^2)&=(5^3+4^3)\div(5^2-5\cdot4+4^2)\\
&=(125+64)\div(25-20+16)\\
&=189\div21\\
&=\boxed{9}.
\end{align*}
First let's convert $0.\overline{6}$ to a fraction
Let $p=0.\overline{6}$ and multiply both sides of this equation by 10 to obtain $10p=6.\overline{6}$
Subtracting the left-hand sides $10p$ and $p$ as well as the right-hand sides $6.\overline{6}$ and $0.\overline{6}$ of these two equations gives $9p=6$, which implies $p=6/9$
We reduce $\frac{6}{9}$ to $\frac{2}{3}$ and multiply by 6 to obtain  \[
\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = \frac{2\cdot 6}{3}=\boxed{4}.
To count the number of zeros at the end of $25\times240$, we must count the number of products $2\times5$
We prime factorize the product by combining the prime factorizations of 25 and 240: $25\times240=(5^2)(2^4\cdot3\cdot5)=2^4\cdot3\cdot5^3$
We take the minimum of the powers of 2 and 5 to find that $25\times240$ has $\boxed{3}$ terminal zeros.
The 9 integers 16, 26, $\ldots$, 86 and 96 each have 6 as a units digit
The 10 integers 60, 61, $\ldots$, 68 and 69 each have 6 as a tens digit
In total, there are $10+9=\boxed{19}$ appearances of the digit 6.
Note: This question asks for the number of times the digit 6 is written, not the number of numbers with the digit 6.
There are 5 elements in this set, so the median is the third largest member
Thus, $n+6=9$, so $n=3$
Then, we can rewrite our set as $\{3,8,9,12,18\}$
The mean of this set is then:$$\frac{3+8+9+12+18}{5}=\boxed{10}$$
Let's examine the two promotions individually.
Promotion A: Jane pays full price, or $\$30$ for the first pair of shoes
She pays a reduced price, $\$30\div 2=\$15$ for the second pair of shoes
Therefore, she pays a total of $\$30+\$15=\$45$ for the two pairs of shoes.
Promotion B:  Jane pays full price, or $\$30$ for the first pair of shoes
She pays $\$10$ off the full price or $\$30-\$10=\$20$ for the second pair of shoes
Therefore, she pays a total of $\$30+\$20=\$50$ for the two pairs of shoes.
Since Jane will pay $\$50$ if she chooses Promotion B and $\$45$ if she chooses Promotion A, Promotion A is the better deal
Jane saves $50-45=\boxed{5}$ dollars by picking Promotion A over Promotion B.
We check what squares divide 245
None of the squares from $2^2$ to $6^2$ divides 245, but $7^2=49$ does
Dividing 245 by 49 gives 5, which has no square factors
So, $\sqrt{245}=\sqrt{49\cdot5}=\boxed{7\sqrt{5}}$.
We notice immediately that both terms are divisible by $5$: $2835 = 5 \cdot 567$ and $8960 = 5 \cdot 1792$
Repeatedly dividing 1792 by 2,  we find that $1792/2^8 = 7$, so $8960 = 2^8 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$
At this point, we are almost done: we know that $2$ does not divide into $2835$, so the only other factor we need to check is $7$
Since $2835 = 28 \cdot 100 + 35$ is clearly divisible by $7$, then the greatest common factor is $5 \times 7 = \boxed{35}$.
One half of one quarter of the earth is $\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{4}=\boxed{\frac{1}{8}}$.
Since subtracting a term is the same as adding the negative, we have $x + [-2(1+x)] + 3(1-x) + [-4(1+2x)]$
Now, we can distribute several terms and negative signs
We have $-2(1+x) = -2 -2x$, and $-4(1+2x) = -4 -8x$
Also, $3(1-x) = 3 - 3x$.
Substituting for these simplified expressions, we get $x + (-2 -2x) + (3 - 3x) + (-4 -8x)$
Next, we can group together similar terms by separating constants from the variable $x$
So, we have $(x -2x -3x -8x) + (-2 +3 -4) = (-12x) + (-3)$
This yields $\boxed{-12x -3}$.
Originally, every side length of the square had a length of 12
Since the triangle is equilateral, each of its side lengths is also 12
There are now a total of 6 sides, making for a perimeter of $\boxed{72}$.
We know that the sum of the interior angles of a $n$-gon is equal to $180(n-2)$ degrees, so the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon (six sides) is $180(6-2)=180 \cdot 4$ degrees
Since a regular hexagon has six interior angles with equal degree measures, one of these angles would have a measure of $\frac{180 \cdot 4}{6}=30\cdot 4 = \boxed{120}$ degrees.
Let's begin with the calculator that initially shows 1
Each time it is passed around the circle, it is cubed
1 to any power is still 1, so no matter how many times 1 is cubed, the final result will still be 1.
Now examine the calculator that starts with a zero
0 squared is still 0 because 0 to any positive power is still 0
Thus, no matter how many times zero is squared, the final number will still be zero.
Finally, let's look at the calculator that initially shows -1
Each time a person gets the calculator, they negate the number
Because there are 42 participants, there are 42 total turns
Thus, -1 is negated 42 times
Because negating a number is the same as multiplying by -1, this is the same as multiplying it by -1 forty-two times
Thus, we are looking for \[(-1) \cdot (-1)^{42}=(-1)^1 \cdot (-1)^{42}=(-1)^{1+42}=(-1)^{43}.\]Recall that $(-a)^n=-a^n$ if $n$ is odd
Because 43 is odd, $(-1)^{43}=-1^{43}=-1$.
Thus, the sum of all of the numbers is $1+0+(-1)=\boxed{0}$.
We have \[0.1\div 0.004 = \frac{0.1}{0.004} = \frac{0.1}{0.004}\cdot\frac{1000}{1000} = \frac{100}{4} = \boxed{25}.\]
Let $\sqrt{x + 150} = n$, where $n$ is a positive integer
Then $x + 150 = n^2$, so $x = n^2 - 150$
We see that $x$ is negative for $n = 1$, 2, 3, $\dots$, 12, but positive for $n \ge 13$, so the number of possible values of $x$ is $\boxed{12}$.
For the total number of possibilities, there are 52 ways to pick the first card, then 51 ways to pick the second card, for a total of $52 \times 51 =\boxed{2652}$ total possibilities.
Since the average monthly rainfall was $41.5\text{ mm}$ in 2003, then the average monthly rainfall in 2004 was $41.5+2=43.5\text{ mm}.$ Therefore, the total rainfall in 2004 was $12 \times 43.5 = \boxed{522}\text{ mm}.$
If there are $3k$ girls in Ms
Snow's class, then there are $2k$ boys
Since the total number of students is $45$, we solve $2k+3k=45$ to find $k=45/5=9$
There are $3k=3(9)=\boxed{27}$ girls in the class.
First, we distribute the $-8$ on the right side to obtain $282-8(y-3) = 282-8y+24 = 306-8y.$ Now, $3y + 7y = 10y$ so we now have $10y = 306-8y,$ which means that $18y = 306$ and we have $y = \boxed{17}.$
Of the original five positive integers, we know that the median value, or the medium-valued number, is 4
Since the unique mode is 3, there must be at least 2 threes, and since this is less than the median, we know both of the smallest numbers are 3
Finally, since the mean is 4.4, the sum of the five integers is $5\cdot 4.4 = 22$, and $22 - 3 - 3 - 4 = 12$ is the sum of the two largest integers
And since the mode of 3 was unique, we know that the larger digits must be greater than 4, and cannot both be 6
So they must be 5 and 7
So our set of integers is $\{ 3, 3, 4, 5, 7\}$
By adding in an 8, we move the median to $\frac{1}{2}(4+5) = \boxed{4.5}$.
We have  \[r = \displaystyle\frac{\sqrt{5^2+12^2}}{\sqrt{16+9}} = \frac{\sqrt{25+144}}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{169}}{5} = \boxed{\frac{13}{5}}.\]
The average of six number is the sum of those numbers divided by six, so the sum of the six numbers must equal $4.1 \times 6 = \boxed{24.6}$.
We are dealing in both meters and feet in this problem, which can be confusing
A careful reading, however, reveals that the 9 meters that Henry walked due north are later eliminated by the 9 meters that he walked due south
At the end, Henry is 24 feet east and 32 feet south of his original location
These are the two legs of a right triangle, so we can figure out the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle using the Pythagorean  Theorem
Actually, 24 is $3 \times 8$ and 32 is $4 \times 8$, so this is just a multiple of the 3-4-5 triangle
The hypotenuse - and Henry's distance from his starting point must be $5 \times 8 = \boxed{40\text{ feet}}$.
We will find the positive divisors of 24 by finding pairs that multiply to 24
We begin with $1$ and $24$, so our list is $$1 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 24.$$  Checking $2$, we find that $2\cdot 12=24$, so our list becomes $$1 \quad 2 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 12 \quad 24.$$  Checking $3$, we find that $3\cdot 8=24$, so our list becomes $$1 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 8 \quad 12 \quad 24.$$  Checking $4$, we find that $4\cdot 6=24$, so our list becomes $$1 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 6 \quad 8 \quad 12 \quad 24.$$  Checking $5$, we find that $24$ is not divisible by $5$, and since $6$ is already on our list, we are done
Thus our final list is $$1 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 6 \quad 8 \quad 12 \quad 24.$$  Therefore, we can count the number of numbers in our list to find that $24$ has $\boxed{8}$ positive divisors.
We consider the different cases:
$\bullet$ $1$ by $1$ square: There are $4$ of those (formed by joining adjacent points).
$\bullet$ $2$ by $2$ square: There is $1$ of those (formed by joining the $4$ corner points).
$\bullet$ $\sqrt{2}$ by $\sqrt{2}$ square: There is $1$ of those (formed by joining the middle points on the $4$ edges, in other words, the diagonals of the $1$ by $1$ squares).
$\bullet$ $1$ by $2$ rectangle: There are $4$ of those.
So that's a total of $4+1+1+4 = \boxed{10}.$
We have $200\ \cancel{\text{kg}} \cdot \dfrac{1\text{ pound}}{0.4536\ \cancel{\text{kg}}} \approx \boxed{441\text{ pounds}}$.
The $108\cdot 0.75=81$ students need $2$ cookies each so $162$ cookies are to be baked
Since $162\div 15=10.8,$ Walter and Gretel must bake $\boxed{11}$ recipes
A few leftovers are a good thing!
First we convert the amount of milk Christine must buy from ounces to liters
We use the conversion factor $\frac{1\ \text{L}}{33.8\ \text{fl.oz}}$ to obtain $45\ \text{fl.oz} \cdot \frac{1\ \text{L}}{33.8\ \text{fl.oz}} \approx 1.331\ \text{L}$
There are $1000\ \text{mL}$ in one liter, and $\frac{1331}{200} \approx 6.657$, so Christine must buy at least $\boxed{7}$ bottles of milk at the store.
Both 15 and 10 share a factor of 5, so the expression simplifies to $\frac{\cancelto{3}{15}}{1} \cdot \frac{7}{\cancelto{2}{10}} \cdot \frac{1}{9}.$ In addition, the 3 and the 9 share a factor of 3, so the expression simplifies to $\frac{\cancel{3}}{1} \cdot \frac{7}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\cancelto{3}{9}}.$ Thus, the expression simplifies to $\frac{7}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{(7)(1)}{(2)(3)} = \boxed{\frac{7}{6}}.$
Obviously, multiplying out each of the exponents is not an option
Instead, notice that the bases of all three exponents are themselves powers of $2$
Let's convert the bases to $2$: $$ 8^8 \cdot 4^4 \div 2^{28} = (2^3)^8 \cdot (2^2)^4 \div 2^{28}.$$Using the power of a power rule in reverse, $(2^3)^8 = 2^{3 \cdot 8} = 2^{24}$
Likewise, $(2^2)^4 = 2^{2 \cdot 4} = 2^8$
Therefore, our simplified expression is $2^{24} \cdot 2^8 \div 2^{28}$.
Now, using the product of powers rule, $2^{24} \cdot 2^8 = 2^{24 + 8} = 2^{32}$
Our expression is now stands at $2^{32} \div 2^{28}$
Finally, we'll use quotient of powers to simplify that to $2^{32-28} = 2^4 = \boxed{16}$.
We immediately note that if 2 is the units digit, then the number is composite
If 2 is the tens digit, only 29 is prime
If 7 is the tens digit, only 79 is prime
If 8 is the tens digit, only 89 is prime
Finally, if 9 is the tens digit, only 97 is prime
Thus, $\boxed{4}$ two-digit primes can be formed.
We can express a power of 36 as a power of 6, since $36 = 6^2$
Then, $36^5 = 6^{10}$
Dividing, we get $6^{12} \div 6^{10} = 6^{12-10}= 6^2$
This gives us $\boxed{36}$.
Since the perimeter of the square is $48,$ its side length is $48 \div 4 = 12.$
Since the side length of the square is $12,$ its area is $12 \times 12 = 144.$
The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 48 \times x = 24x.$
Since the area of the triangle equals the area of the square, then $24x=144$ or $x=\boxed{6}.$
Adding $4x$ to both sides, we have $5 > 17+4x$
Then, subtracting $17$ from both sides, we have $-12 > 4x$
Finally, dividing both sides by $4$, we have $-3 > x$
This inequality states that $x$ is strictly less than $-3$
The largest integer satisfying that condition is $\boxed{-4}$.
The area of the floor in square feet $5 \cdot 2 = 10$
Each tile has an area in square feet of $\left ( \dfrac{1}{4} \right ) \left ( \dfrac{1}{3} \right ) =
\dfrac{1}{12}$, so the minimum number of tiles is $\dfrac{10}{\left( \frac{1}{12} \right)} = \boxed{120}.$
Since $\overline{AB}\parallel\overline{CD}$, we have $\angle A+ \angle D = 180^\circ$
Since $\angle A = 2\angle D$, we have $2\angle D + \angle D = 180^\circ$, so $3\angle D = 180^\circ$, which means $\angle D = 60^\circ$
Therefore, $\angle A = 2\angle D = \boxed{120^\circ}$.

Simplifying, $n+(n+1)+(n+2)+(n+3)+(n+4)=\boxed{5n+10}$.
The area of the wall including the window is $9\cdot12=108$ square feet
The area of the window is $2\cdot4=8$ square feet
Thus, the area Sandy needs to paint is $108-8=\boxed{100}$ square feet.
We translate the problem to the equation $2x+10 = \frac{1}{2}(5x+30)$
Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $4x+20 = 5x+30$
Subtracting 4x from both sides yield $20 = x+30$
Subtracting 30 from both sides yields $ x= \boxed{-10}$.
Dividing $-70$ by $9$ gives $-8$ with a remainder of $2$, or $$-70 = -8 \cdot 9 + 2.$$Thus, $-8 \cdot 9 = \boxed{-72}$ is the largest multiple of $9$ which is smaller than $-70$.
Squaring both sides of the equation $\sqrt{3x + 7} = 10$, we get $3x + 7 = 10^2 = 100$, so $x = (100 - 7)/3 = 93/3 = \boxed{31}$.
Since the small circle is tangent to the large circle at $C$ and point $B$ lies on the smaller circle and is the center of the larger circle, we know the radius of the bigger circle is twice the radius of the smaller circle, or six inches.
To find the shaded area, subtract the area of the smaller circle from the area of the larger circle
$6^2\pi - 3^2\pi = 36\pi - 9\pi = \boxed{27\pi}$
\[ - OR - \] Consider the tangent line to circle $B$ at $C$, say line $l$
Then $BC \perp l$
But since circle $A$ is tangent to circle $B$ at $C$, we also have that $AB \perp l$
Hence $A$ is on segment $BC$, and $BC$ is a diameter of circle $A$
Thus by homothety circle $A$ covers $\frac{1}{4}$ the area of circle $B$
The shaded region is thus $\frac{3}{4}$ of the area of circle $B$, and hence is 3 times the area of circle $A$, or simply $(\pi \cdot 3^2)\cdot 3 = 27\pi$.
Since the ratio of red to blue to green marbles is $1:5:3$, the ratio of green marbles to the total number of marbles is $3/(1+5+3) = 3/9=1/3$
Since the green marbles are one-third of the total, and there are 27 green marbles, there must be $3\cdot 27 = \boxed{81}$ total marbles.
The president can be any of the 10 members, the secretary can be any of the 9 remaining members, the treasurer can be any of the remaining 8 members, and the morale officer can be any of the remaining 7 members
There are $10\times 9\times 8\times7=\boxed{5,\!040}$ ways.
To find the average number of cookies in a package, we find the total number of cookies and divide that number by the number of packages
Doing so, we get  \begin{align*}
&\frac{8+10+12+15+16+17+20}{7}\\
&\qquad=\frac{(8+12)+10+15+16+17+20}{7}\\
&\qquad=\frac{20+10+15+16+17+20}{7}\\
&\qquad=\frac{98}{7}\\
&\qquad=14.
\end{align*} There is an average of $\boxed{14}$ cookies in a package.
We calculate the desired ratio for each envelope: \begin{align*}
\text{A} &= \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \\
\text{B} &= \frac{9}{3} = 3 \\
\text{C} &= \frac{6}{6} = 1 \\
\text{D} &= \frac{11}{4} = 2.75
\end{align*} $\text B,$ $\text C,$ and $\text D$ are out of range, so the answer is $\boxed{3}.$
The days that the bookstore has a sale in July are July 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30.

There is only $\boxed{1}$ day on both lists.
The smallest prime is 2, which is a factor of every even number
Because $\boxed{58}$ is the only even number, it has the smallest prime factor.
From each vertex $V$, we can draw 4 diagonals: one to each vertex that is not $V$ and does not share an edge with $V$
There are 7 vertices in a heptagon, so we might be tempted to say the answer is $7\times 4 = 28$
However, note that this counts each diagonal twice, one time for each vertex
Hence there are $\frac{28}{2} = \boxed{14}$ distinct diagonals in a convex heptagon.
If all sides measured $6$ units, the total perimeter would be $36$
But this is $2$ too many units, so we must change two of these sides to $5$ units
Thus $\boxed{4}$ sides measure $6$ units.
We have \[\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{7}{11} = \frac{1\cdot 3 \cdot 7}{2\cdot 5\cdot 11} = \boxed{\frac{21}{110}}.\]
Since a diagonal of a square breaks up the square into two 45-45-90 triangles, a diagonal is $\sqrt{2}$ times longer than a side
Thus, the length of a side of the square is $\sqrt{2}/\sqrt{2}=\boxed{1}$ inch.
Since the sum of the angles at any point on a line is $180^\circ,$ then we find that \begin{align*}

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\circ,$ we have  \begin{align*}
\angle AGE &=180^\circ - \angle GAE - \angle GEA \\
&= 180^\circ - 60^\circ - 100^\circ \\
&= 20^\circ.
\end{align*} Since $\angle AGE=20^\circ,$ then the reflex angle at $G$ is $360^\circ - 20^\circ = 340^\circ.$ Therefore, $x=\boxed{340}.$
Since $18=3\cdot 6$, there is an integer $n$ such that $18=3\cdot n$
Therefore, by definition of factor, 3 is a factor of 18 and statement A is true.
We can list the divisors of 187
They are 1, 11, 17, and 187
Therefore, 17 is a divisor of 187
We can also list the divisors of 52
They are 1, 2, 4, 13, 26, and 52
Therefore, 17 is not a divisor of 52 and statement B is true.
Since $72=24\cdot 3$, there is an integer $n$ such that $72=24\cdot n$
Therefore, by definition of divisor, 24 is a divisor of 72 and statement C is false.
We already listed the divisors of 52 for statement B
Since 13 was one of them, 13 is a divisor of 52, and statement D is false.
We can list the factors of 160
They are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 32, 40, 80, and 160
Therefore, 8 is a factor of 160, and statement E is true.
Therefore, the statements that are true are $\boxed{\text{A,B,E}}$.
We have:
$\sqrt{288}=\sqrt{144\cdot 2}=\boxed{12\sqrt{2}}$.
We have to be careful!  We can combine all the $w$ terms to get \[2w+4w+6w+8w+10w+12 = (2+4+6+8+10)w + 12 = \boxed{30w+12},\] but we can't combine the 12 with anything!
We will list out the multiples of $11$ between $50$ and $100$, and eliminate all the multiples that don't satisfy the other conditions
If our work is correct, there should only be one number, the answer, that satisfies all the conditions.
The multiples of $11$ that we are interested in are $55$, $66$, $77$, $88$, and $99$
$66$ and $88$ are multiples of $2$, so they are out
Now, of the remaining numbers, only $99$ has a digit-sum that is a multiple of $3$ ($9+9=18$)
Therefore, Bob's favorite number is $\boxed{99}$.
The first two digits may be any of 3, so there are $3^2 = 9$ choices for the first two
There are $3\times 2$ possible values for the last two, since we have 3 choices for the first and then 2 for the second, so there are $9\times 6 = \boxed{54}$ possible integers.
The area of the garden was 500 square feet$(50\times 10)$ and its perimeter was 120 feet, $2\times (50+10)$
The square garden is also enclosed by 120 feet of fence so its sides are each 30 feet long
The square garden's area is 900 square feet ($30\times 30)$
and this has increased the garden area by $\boxed{400}$ square feet

We have $\angle Z = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 45^\circ = 45^\circ$, so $XY = XZ = \boxed{12\sqrt{2}}$.
We can solve the problem with a Venn Diagram
First we know that 5 dogs will eat both salmon and watermelon:
label("Watermelon", (2,75));
label("Salmon", (80,75));
draw(Circle((30,45), 22));
draw(Circle((58, 45), 22));
label("$5$", (44, 45));
//label(scale(0.8)*"$126-x$",(28,58));
//label(scale(0.8)*"$129-x$",(63,58));
[/asy]
This tells us that $9-5=4$ of the dogs like only watermelon and $48-5=43$ of the dogs like only salmon.
label("Watermelon", (2,75));
label("Salmon", (80,75));
draw(Circle((30,45), 22));
draw(Circle((58, 45), 22));
label("$5$", (44, 45));
label(scale(0.8)*"$4$",(28,45));
label(scale(0.8)*"$43$",(63,45));
[/asy]
Therefore $5+4+43=52$ of the dogs like at least one of these foods
Therefore $60-52=\boxed{8}$ dogs do not like watermelon or salmon.
Recall that the common multiples of a set of integers are precisely the multiples of the least common multiple of the set
In this case, the common multiples are integers of the form $24k$ (where $k$ is an integer), since 24 is the least common multiple of 8 and 12
Since $24(3)=72$ and $24(4)=96>90$, the greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 less than 90 is $\boxed{72}$.
There are $5$ possibilities for the first place finisher
After first place is determined, there are $4$ remaining possibilities for the second place finisher
Finally, there are $3$ possibilities for third place once the first two are determined
Thus there are $5\cdot4\cdot3=\boxed{60}$ 1st-2nd-3rd place outcomes.
Performing the arithmetic in the parentheses first, we obtain $4^4 \div 4^3 = 4$, so we have \[(4^4 \div 4^3) \cdot 2^8 = 4\cdot 2^8.\]Since  $4 = 2^2$, we have  \[4\cdot 2^8 = 2^2 \cdot 2^8 = 2^{10}= \boxed{1024}.\]
The hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle is $\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg, so each leg of the triangle has length 4
Therefore, the area of the triangle is $(4)(4)/2 = \boxed{8}$ square units.
We can solve this using basic arithmetic: If 13 of the students with calculators are girls, and 22 students total have calculators, then $22 - 13 = 9$ of the students with calculators are boys
So if 9 boys have calculators, and there are 16 boys total, then $16 - 9 = \boxed{7}$ boys don't have calculators
Alternatively, we could solve this problem using a Venn diagram.
The average length is $\frac{1.5+4.5}{2}=\boxed{3}$ inches.
Since $\sqrt{5+n}=7$ and $7=\sqrt{49}$, then $5+n=49$, so $n=\boxed{44}$.
We have to first choose a president, and then we have to choose 2 people, but the order in which we choose the people doesn't matter
So first there are 8 ways to choose the president
Then there are 7 ways to choose the first person, and 6 ways to choose second person
However, we have overcounted, since choosing person A first and person B second will give us the same committee as choosing person B first and person A second
Each committee is counted twice in our original $7 \times 6$ count, so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcount, giving us $8\times(7 \times 6)/2 = \boxed{168}$ ways to choose a president and a 2-person committee from 8 people.
The sum of the first five primes is $2+3+5+7+11=28$
Divide the sum by the next prime, 13, to get $28\div13=2R2$
Thus the remainder is $\boxed{2}$.
If $A$ is the tens digit and $B$ the units digit, then the two-digit number $AB$ (having $A$ in the tens place and $B$ in the units place) must be one of the following: $49$, $58$, $67$, $76$, $85$, $94$
Since the original number was divisible by $4$, $AB$ must be divisible by $4$
So $AB = 76$ is the only possibility, and $A\cdot B = 7\cdot 6 = \boxed{42}$.
There are $10$ options for the first person and $9$ options left for the second person for a preliminary count of $10 \cdot 9 = 90$ pairs
However, the order in which Fiona chooses the people doesn't matter, and we've counted each pair twice, which means our final answer is $\dfrac{10\cdot9}{2}=\boxed{45}$ pairs of friends.
If we label the six points of our hexagon $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, and $F$, diagonals can only be drawn between non-adjacent points
Therefore, the diagonals are $\overline{AC}$, $\overline{AD}$, $\overline{AE}$, $\overline{BD}$, $\overline{BE}$, $\overline{BF}$, $\overline{CE}$, $\overline{CF}$, and $\overline{DF}$
There are $\boxed{9}$ diagonals that can be drawn

Divide the square into $16$ smaller squares as shown
The shaded square is formed from $4$ half-squares, so its area is $2.$ The ratio $2$ to $16$ is $\boxed{\frac{1}{8}}.$

In general, to express the number $0.\overline{n}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&10x &=& n&.nnnnn\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.nnnnn\ldots \\
\hline
&9x &=& n &
\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\overline{n} = \frac{n}{9}$.
Hence, our original problem reduces to computing $\frac 59 + \frac 19 - \frac 39 = \frac 39 = \boxed{\frac 13}$.
Because the train is moving 60 miles per hour, the front of the train moves 1 mile every minute
Therefore, in the three minutes since the front of the train entered the tunnel, the front of the train has moved three miles
At the end of these three minutes, we know the front of the train is 1 mile beyond the end of the tunnel,because the train is one mile long and its tail is just leaving the tunnel
So, the front of the train has moved 3 miles from the beginning of the tunnel and is now 1 mile beyond the end of the tunnel
This tells us that the tunnel is $3-1 = \boxed{2\text{ miles}}$ long.
We prime factorize 1332 and 888: $1332=2^2\cdot3^2\cdot37$ and $888=2^3\cdot3\cdot37$
The prime factorization of any common multiple of these two numbers must include 2 to at least the third power, three to at least the second power, and 37 to at least the first power
The least common multiple is the one that includes only these factors and nothing more: $2^3\cdot3^2\cdot37=\boxed{2664}$.
Remembering that ``of" means multiply, we want to find $\frac{2}{5} \times 25$
Since multiplication is commutative, we have: \[\frac{2}{5} \times 25 = \frac{25}{5} \times 2\]A fraction is another way to represent division, so $\frac{25}{5} = 25\div5 = 5$, and $5\times2 = \boxed{10}$ minutes.
We know that the hypotenuse (the longest side) of the right triangle is $5$ meters and the shortest side is $3$ meters and that $3,4,5$ is a Pythagorean triple
Therefore, the other leg of the triangle must have a length of $4$ meters
Since the two legs are also the base and the height of the triangle, we have that the area of the triangle is equal to $\frac{1}{2}(3)(4) = \boxed{6}$ square meters.
Alternatively, we could have used the Pythagorean Formula to find the length of the other side
If $y$ is the length of the other leg, then we have that $3^2 + y^2 = 5^2$, so $y^2=5^2-3^2=16$
Taking the square root of both sides, we have that $y=4$
Since we have the lengths of both legs, we can now find that the area of the triangle is $6$ square meters.
Since $\overline{AB}\parallel\overline{DC}$, $\angle ABC + \angle BCD = 180^\circ$, so $\angle BCD = 180^\circ - 73^\circ = 107^\circ$
$\angle ACB + \angle ACD = \angle BCD$, so $\angle ACB = 107^\circ - 40^\circ = \boxed{67^\circ}$.
We will break up the problem into cases based on the second digit and count the number of integers in each case
If the second digit is 0, there are no integers because the first digit (1) is larger than the second
Similarly, if the second digit is 1, there are no integers
If the second digit is 2, there are 7 integers (with third digit from 3 to 9, inclusive)
If the second digit is 3, there are 6 integers (with third digit from 4 to 9, inclusive)
If the second digit is 4, there are 5 integers (with third digit from 5 to 9, inclusive)
Among all the cases, there are $7+6+5=\boxed{18}$ integers.
In rhombus $ABCD$, the acute angle $DAB$ has a measure of $60^\circ$
We drop a perpendicular from $D$ to $\overline{AB}$, which creates a 30-60-90 right triangle
Since the hypotenuse $\overline{AD}$ has a length of $2$ cm, the length of $\overline{AE}$ is $\frac{AD}{2}=1$ cm and the length of $\overline{DE}$ is $AE\cdot\sqrt{3}=\sqrt{3}$ cm
We now know the base of the rhombus is $2$ cm and the height of the rhombus is $\sqrt{3}$ cm, so the area is $bh=\boxed{2\sqrt{3}}$ sq cm.

There are four choices for the bottom scoop
Once this decision is made, there are only 3 choices for the scoop above that
Similarly there are 2 choices for the third scoop, and the final scoop is uniquely determined
In total, there are $4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1 = \boxed{24}$ orders.
Substituting $-5$ for $x$ in the first equation, we have $(-5)^2 = y-3$
So $25=y-3$
Adding $3$ to both sides, $y=\boxed{28}$.
Recall that if $x$ is a multiple of $y$, and $y$ is a multiple of $z$, then $x$ is a multiple of  $z$
Because $b$ is a multiple of  $6$ and $6$ is a multiple of  $3$, then $b$ must be a multiple of $3$.
Recall that the difference between two multiples of $w$ is also a multiple of $w$
Thus, because $a$ and $b$ are both multiples of  $3$ (using the information from statement 1), their difference is also a multiple of $3$.
We do not know if $a$ is a multiple of  $6$
For example, $12$ is a multiple of  both $3$ and $6$, but $9$ is a multiple of  $3$ and not $6$
Thus, we cannot use the property that the difference between two multiples of $w$ is a multiple of $w$
We don't know if this statement is true.
We know that $b$ is a multiple of  $6$, and $6$ is a multiple of  $2$, so $b$ is a multiple of  $2$
However, just as in statement 3, we do not know if $a$ is a multiple of  $2$
We also don't know if this statement is true.
Statements $\boxed{\text{A, B}}$ must be true.
Since the polygon has perimeter 108 cm and each side has length 12 cm, then the polygon has $108 \div 12 = \boxed{9}$ sides.
The prime factorization of 3774 is $3774=2\cdot3\cdot17\cdot37$.
$2$ and $3$ are troublesome here, because they are both 1-digit factors
We can deal with them by multiplying them by some other factor to produce a bigger factor.
One thing we might try is multiplying them together, but $2\cdot3=6$ is still only one digit.
If we try to put both of them with the $17$, that produces $2\cdot3\cdot17=102$, which is too many digits
Putting them with the $37$ would be even bigger, so that won't work either.
So we have to put one of them with each of the other factors
We can't put $3$ with $37$ because $3\cdot37=111>100$, so the only thing we can do is say $2\cdot37=74$ and $3\cdot17=51$
The smaller of those two is $\boxed{51}$.
We first list the factors of 96 to see which are multiples of 12
The factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96
We see which factors are divisible by 12, because if they are divisible by 12 then they are multiples of 12
We can check them each: 1 is not, 2 is not, 3 is not, 4 is not, 6 is not, 8 is not, 12 is, 16 is not, 24 is, 32 is not, 48 is, and 96 is
So there are $\boxed{4}$ factors of 96 that are multiples of 12.
If $20\%$ of the toys were put on the shelves, the $80\%$ of the toys were left in storage
Therefore, we are given $80\% T=120$, where $T$ is the number of toys in the order
Rewriting $80\%$ as $\frac{4}{5}$ and multiplying both sides by $\frac{5}{4}$, we find that $T=120\cdot\frac{5}{4}=30\cdot 5=\boxed{150}$.
First let's convert $0.\overline{6}$ to a fraction
Let $p=0.\overline{6}$ and multiply both sides of this equation by 10 to obtain $10p=6.\overline{6}$
Subtracting the left-hand sides $10p$ and $p$ as well as the right-hand sides $6.\overline{6}$ and $0.\overline{6}$ of these two equations gives $9p=6$, which implies $p=2/3$
We divide $6$ by $2/3$ to get $$6 \div \frac{2}{3} = \cancelto{3}{6}\hspace{1mm} \cdot \frac{3}{\cancel{2}} = \boxed{9}.$$
The area of the square is $5^2=25$ square units, and the shaded area is $(1^2-0^2)+(3^2-2^2)+(5^2-4^2)=15$ square units
Therefore, $\frac{15}{25}=\boxed{60}$ percent of the region is shaded.
Let the prime be $n$
We are given that $n-4$ and $n+7$ are consecutive perfect squares, and they differ by $(n+7)-(n-4)=11$
Writing out the first few perfect squares, we see that 25 and 36 differ by 11
Hence, $n-4=25$ and $n+7=36$, so $n=\boxed{29}$.
The sum of the angles of a hexagon is $180(6-2) = 720$ degrees, which means each angle in a regular hexagon has measure $\frac{720^\circ}{6} = 120^\circ$
Therefore, the indicated angle has measure $180^\circ - 120^\circ = \boxed{60^\circ}$.
$\text{\emph{Strategy: Add areas.}}$
Each small square has an area of 1
Separate $EFBA$ into rectangle I and right triangles II and III, as shown
The area of rectangle I is 6; triangle II is 1/2 of rectangle $AGED$, so its area is 1.5
The same is true of triangle III
Thus, $6 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 9$
The area of trapezoid $EFBA$ is $\boxed{9}$ square units.

[/asy] Since $PQ=QR$, then $QR=3$.
Since $PQXT$ has three right angles, it must be a rectangle, so $TX=PQ=3$
Also, $QX=PT=6$.
Since $TS=7$ and $TX=3$, then $XS=TS-TX=7-3=4$.
Since $QX=6$ and $QR=3$, then $RX=QX-QR=6-3=3$.
Since $PQXT$ is a rectangle, then $\angle RXS=90^\circ$.
By the Pythagorean Theorem in $\triangle RXS$, \[ RS^2 = RX^2 + XS^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9+16=25 \]so $RS=5$, since $RS>0$.
Therefore, the perimeter is $$PQ+QR+RS+ST+TP=3+3+5+7+6=\boxed{24}.$$
The price at Super Savers is $\$39.96-\$9=\$30.96.$ The price at Penny Wise is $0.75(\$39.96)=\$29.97.$ Thus the difference is $\$30.96-\$29.97=\boxed{99}$ cents.

Since 2, 5, 7 are pairwise relatively prime (meaning that no two of them share a prime factor), we must find the least three-digit positive integer that is divisible by $2\cdot5\cdot7=70$
That integer is $70\cdot2=\boxed{140}$.
Adding 14 and 36 yields 50, and then adding 22 yields 72
Dividing by 3 yields $\boxed{24}$.
The possibilities for the two digits are 0 and 8, 1 and 7, 2 and 6, 3 and 5, and 4 and 4
Of these, a prime number could only be made from the 1 and 7 or the 3 and 5
17, 71, and 53 are prime, but 35 is not
Thus, there are $\boxed{3}$ such two-digit prime numbers.
The original garden has an area of $40\cdot 10=400\text{ ft}^2$
Its perimeter is $40+10+40+10=100\text{ ft}$, so a square fence using the same amount of fencing has sides of length $25\text{ ft}$ and an area of $25\cdot 25 = 625\text{ ft}^2$
The increase in area is thus $625 - 400 = \boxed{225}$ square feet.
Triangle $ABC$ has base $AB$ of length $25\text{ cm}$ and height $AC$ of length $20\text{ cm}.$ Therefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2}bh &= \frac{1}{2}(25 \mbox{ cm})(20 \mbox{ cm}) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}(500 \mbox{ cm}^2) \\
&= \boxed{250} \mbox{ cm}^2.
\end{align*}
$36 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2$ and $132 = 2^2 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 11^1$, so lcm$[36, 132] = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 11^1 = \boxed{396}$.
Combining the fractions on the left hand side: $a + \frac{a}{3} = \frac{3a}{3} + \frac{a}{3} = \frac{4a}{3} = \frac{8}{3} \Rightarrow 4a = 8 \Rightarrow a = \boxed{2}$.
Let's break the $25$ cents down into five $5$-cent blocks
One nickel or five pennies are the two ways we can fill a $5$-cent block
One dime fills two $5$-cent blocks
Now we consider the possible cases based on how many dimes we use.
$\emph{Two dimes:}$ Let's say we have two dimes, which fill up four out of the five $5$-cent blocks
We only have to fill one more block, and there are two ways to do that (with a nickel or with pennies)
This case yields $\emph{2}$ possible ways.
$\emph{One dime:}$ If we use one dime, we fill up two out of the five blocks
Now we have to use nickels and/or pennies to fill up the remaining three blocks
The ways we can do that are to use no nickels, one nickel, two nickels, or three nickels and make up the rest of the amount with pennies
This case yields $\emph{4}$ possible ways.
$\emph{No dimes:}$ If we use no dimes, we have to use nickels and/or pennies to fill up five blocks
We can use $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \text{ or } 5$ nickels and make up the rest of the amount with pennies
This case yields $\emph{6}$ possible ways.
So the total number of ways is $2+4+6=\boxed{12}$ ways.
Let the original value of the stock be $x$
At the end of the first day, the stock has fallen to $.8x$
On the second day, the stock rises to $1.3(.8x)=1.04x$
Thus, the stock has increased $\boxed{4}$ percent from its original price over the two days.
Since the shaded region is everything inside the larger circle but outside the smaller, its area is $29^2 \pi - 19^2\pi = 480\pi$
So, letting the radius of the third circle be $r$, we have $\pi r^2 = 480 \pi$, or $r = \sqrt{480} = \boxed{4\sqrt{30}}$.
We simply need to find the Least Common Multiple of 15, 20, and 25
They can be expressed as $3\times 5$, $4\times 5$, $5 \times 5$ - since 3,4, and 5 are all relatively prime, their LCM is going to be $5 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 = 300$
Thus, after 300 minutes, they will ring their bells together again
300 minutes is 5 hours, so $\boxed{05\!:\!00}$ p.m
will be the next time.
Ten cubed is 1000, so we know that $x$ must be less than $10$
Because $9$ is the greatest multiple of $3$ that is less than $10$, $\boxed{9}$ is the greatest possible value of $x$.
We know that $x$ is between 39 and 80, and since $6^2 = 36 < 39$ and $9^2 = 81 > 80$, this means that $6^2 < x < 9^2$
This leaves us with two possibilities for $x$, which are $7^2 = 49$, and $8^2 = 64$
We then see that only 64 is divisible by four, so $x =$ $\boxed{64}$.
We have:
$\sqrt{25000}=\sqrt{2500\cdot 10}=\boxed{50\sqrt{10}}$.
$99=3^2\cdot11$, so its greatest prime factor is $\boxed{11}$.
In total, there are $5+6+7+8=26$ jelly beans in the bag.
Since there are 8 blue jelly beans, the probability of selecting a blue jelly bean is  $$\frac{8}{26}=\boxed{\frac{4}{13}}.$$
The sum of the angle measures of a hexagon is $180(6-2) = 720$ degrees, so each angle of a regular hexagon measures $720^\circ/6=120^\circ$
Therefore, $\angle BAF = 120^\circ$, which means $\angle FAP = 180^\circ - \angle BAF = 60^\circ$
Similarly, $\angle PFA = 60^\circ$
Since the angles of $\triangle APF$ sum to $180^\circ$, we have $\angle APF = 180^\circ - 60^\circ - 60^\circ = \boxed{60^\circ}$.

The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7; the largest two-digit prime is 97 (98 and 99 are both composite)
The product of these three primes is $5 \cdot 7 \cdot 97 = 35 \cdot 97 = 35(100-3)=3500-105=\boxed{3395}$.
Every minute, the minute hand moves $360 \div 60 = 6$ degrees
At 25 minutes past the hour, the minute hand is $25 \times 6 = 150$ degrees past the vertical 12:00 position
Every minute, the hour hand moves $360 \div 12 \div 60 = 0.5$ degrees
At 25 minutes past 12:00, the hour hand is $25 \times 0.5 = 12.5$ degrees past the vertical 12:00 position
The angle between the hands of the clock at 12:25 is $150 - 12.5 = \boxed{137.5\text{ degrees}}$.

Seeing that triangle $ACD$ is a 5-12-13 right triangle, $AD=12$
Then using Pythagorean Theorem, we can calculate $BD$ to be $BD=\sqrt{15^2-12^2}=\sqrt{3^2(5^2-4^2)}=3\sqrt{25-16}=3\sqrt{9}=3 \cdot 3 = 9$
Thus, the area of triangle $ABD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 \cdot 9=6 \cdot 9=54 \text{sq units}$ and the area of triangle $ACD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 \cdot 5=6 \cdot 5=30 \text{sq units}$
The area of triangle $ABC$ is the difference between the two areas: $54 \text{sq units} - 30 \text{sq units} = \boxed{24} \text{sq units}$.
First, we find the greatest common factor of $84$ and $144$ by factoring $84$ and $144,$ then multiplying the common factors
To factor $84$ and $144,$ we use tables
The first entry in the left column of such a table is the number you are trying to factor
The smallest prime factor goes in the right column, and the next number in the left column is the quotient of those two numbers
We then continue this method until there is a $1$ in the left column
Then the prime factorization is the right column, with the exponent of each factor being the number of times it appears.
$$\begin{array}{c|ccc|c} 84&2&\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &144&2\\42&2&&72&2\\21&3&&36&2\\7&7&&18&2\\1&&&9&3\\&&&3&3\\\ &&&1& \end{array} \\ \\ \\
84=2^2\cdot 3\cdot 7\ \ \ 144=2^4\cdot3^2$$The greatest common factor is then $2^2\cdot3=12,$ so we divide both numerator and denominator by $12$ to get $\frac{84}{144}=\boxed{\frac{7}{12}}.$
Let $x$ be the smallest number of people that can be broken up into 15 groups of equal membership and into 48 groups of equal membership
This means $x$ must be a multiple of both 15 and 48
The smallest such number is the least common multiple of 15 and 48
$15=3 \cdot 5$ and $48=2^4 \cdot 3$
Thus, any multiple of 15 and 48 must have a factor of 2 raised to at least the fourth power, a factor of 3 raised to at least the first power, and a factor of 5 raised to at least the first power
Thus, the least such multiple is $2^4 \cdot 3\cdot 5 = \boxed{240}$.
For the square to have an area of $25,$ each side length must be $\sqrt{25}=5.$
The rectangle's width is equal to that of the square and therefore must also be $5.$ The length of the rectangle is double its width or $5\times 2=10.$ The area of the rectangle is thus $5\times 10=\boxed{50}.$
Keep up with the north-south movement separately from the east-west movement
Leigh goes 40 yards south and 10 yards north, so she ends up 30 yards south of her starting position
She goes 60 yards west and 20 yards east for a net east-west displacement of 40 yards west
Going 30 yards south and 40 yards west puts Leigh $\sqrt{30^2+40^2}=\boxed{50}$ yards away.
Dividing 50 by 7 will give us an answer of 7 with a remainder of 1
$$50=7\cdot 7 +1$$Because the answer must be less than 50, $7\cdot 7=\boxed{49}$ must be our answer.
The positive divisors of $24$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,$ and $24$, for a total of $\boxed{8}$ such numbers.
In $\triangle ABC$ shown below, \begin{align*}
\angle BAC &= 180^{\circ}-\angle ABC-\angle ACB \\
&= 180^{\circ}-60^{\circ}-90^{\circ} \\
&= 30^{\circ}.
\end{align*} Since $\angle ADC$ is a straight angle, \begin{align*}
\angle ADE &= 180^{\circ}-\angle CDE \\
&= 180^{\circ}-48^{\circ} \\
&= 132^{\circ}.
\end{align*} In $\triangle AED,$ \begin{align*}
\angle AED &= 180^{\circ}-\angle ADE-\angle EAD \\
&= 180^{\circ}-132^{\circ}-30^{\circ} \\
&= 18^{\circ}.
\end{align*} Since $\angle AEB$ is a straight angle,  \begin{align*}
\angle DEB &= 180^{\circ}-\angle AED \\
&= 180^{\circ}-18^{\circ} \\
&= 162^{\circ}.
\end{align*} Thus, the value of $x$ is $\boxed{162}.$ [asy]

Let's first look at how much total money Mary spent
Since drinks cost $p$ dollars, and she bought $3$ of them, she spent $3p$ dollars on drinks
One drink costs $p$ dollars, so a medium pizza costs $2p$ dollars and a large pizza costs $3p$ dollars
Therefore, in total, Mary spent \[3p+2p+3p=8p\] dollars.
Now, Mary had $30$ dollars to begin with, and she spent $8p$ dollars, so she has \[\boxed{30-8p}\] dollars left.
We will begin by finding all the positive factors of $-12$, which are the same as the positive factors of $12$
The positive factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12
The four numbers we seek must be among these six numbers.
Note that the number $4$ is not a factor of each number on the list, since dividing $114$ by $4$ gives a remainder of $2$
We also know that $12$ cannot be a factor of $114$, since dividing $114$ by $12$ gives a remainder of $6$
However, $6$ is a factor of each number on the list, since   \begin{align*}
36 &= 6 \cdot 6\\
72 &= 6 \cdot 12\\
-12 &= 6 \cdot (-2)\\
96 &= 6 \cdot 16\\
114 &= 6 \cdot 19
\end{align*}Since $1$, $2$, $3$, and $6$ are factors of $6$, and $6$ is a factor of each number on the list, $1$, $2$, $3$, and $6$ must be a factor of each number on the list
So these are the four numbers we were looking for, and our final answer is $$1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = \boxed{12}.$$
To find the mean of these $5$ values, we must add them and then divide by $5$
Thus we get that the answer is $\frac{0+2z+4z+8z+16z}{5}=\frac{30z}{5} = \boxed{6z}$.
$68=2^2\cdot17$ and $92=2^2\cdot23$
The only prime number that these two prime factorizations have in common is the number 2
If a number's prime factorization has a 2 raised to a power greater than 2, it will not be a factor of either of these numbers, so their GCF is $2^2=\boxed{4}$.
Recall that multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction
We get \[
6 \div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \cdot 8 = 2 - 2 - 8 + 16.
\]We rewrite the subtractions as additions of negations so we can rearrange:  \begin{align*}
2 - 2 - 8 + 16 &= 2 + (-2) + (-8) + 16 \\
&= 16 + 2 + (-2) + (-8) \\
&= 18 - (2+8) \\
&= 18-10 \\
&= \boxed{8}.
\end{align*}
The decimal representation of $\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\overline{142857}$, and that of $\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.\overline{3}$
The first has a repeating block of 6 digits and the second has a repeating block of 1 digit, so we believe the repeating block of the sum will have 6 digits and try adding the first 6 digits of each decimal representation
$$ \begin{array}{c@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}& & &
&1 & 4 & \stackrel{1}{2} & 8 & \stackrel{1}{5} & 7\\& +& &
&3 &3 & 3 & 3& 3 & 3\\ \cline{1-9} & & & .& 4 &7 & 6 & 1 & 9 & 0\\ \end{array} $$ Notice that continuing the addition past the first six digits will result in repeating blocks of the same six digits ($.142857+.333333=.476190$), so the decimal representation of the sum is $0.\overline{476190}$
Since 20 divided by 6 has a remainder of 2, the 20th digit following the decimal point is the same as the second digit following the decimal point, which is $\boxed{7}$.
We begin by finding the prime factorizations of the numbers: \[8 = 2^3, \quad 12 = 2^2\cdot 3, \quad 24 = 2^3 \cdot 3.\]For the greatest common factor, $2^2$ is the largest factor that occurs in each number, so $A=2^2=4$.
For the least common multiple, the highest power of 2 that appears is 3, and the highest power of 3 that appears is 1
So $B=2^3 \cdot 3^1 = 24$.
Adding $A$ and $B$ gives $A + B = 4+24=\boxed{28}$.
A triangle can't have two right angles, so a right triangle with two congruent angles must have congruent acute angles
That is, $\triangle PQR$ must be an isosceles right triangle with acute angles at $Q$ and $R$
Therefore, $\overline{QR}$ is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and $QP=RP=\frac{QR}{\sqrt{2}}$, which means $QP=RP=6$ and $[QRP]=(QP)(RP)/2 = \boxed{18}$.

Let $x$ be the number of students who earn a B
Then we know that the number of students who get an A is $.7x$ and the number of students who earn a C is $1.4x$
Since every student in the class gets an A, B, or C and there are 31 students, this gives us the equation $.7x + x + 1.4x = 31 \Rightarrow 3.1x = 31 \Rightarrow x =\boxed{10}$.
We observe that the prime factorization of $120$ is equal to $2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$
It is a relatively quick matter to test that $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$ share a prime factor with $120$, but $\boxed{7}$ does not.
To find the median, we first arrange the number of successful free throws in increasing numerical order: $$6,12,14,15,15,18,19,19.$$ Since there is an even number of terms, the median can be found the by averaging the middle two (the fourth and the fifth) terms
Both the fourth and the fifth terms are $15$, so the median number of successful free throws that the basketball player made is $\boxed{15}$.
Since $\angle PQR=90^\circ$, then $2x^\circ+x^\circ=90^\circ$ or $3x=90$ or $x=\boxed{30}$.
Since $2x+7=3$ we have $x=-2$
Hence $$-2 = bx - 10 = -2b-10, \quad \text{so} \quad 2b = -8, \ \text{and } \boxed{b = -4}.$$
From triangle $ABC$, we have $\angle A = 180^\circ - \angle C - \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - (50^\circ + 15^\circ) = 90^\circ - 65^\circ = \boxed{25^\circ}$.
Squaring both sides of the equation $\sqrt{x - 2} = 8$, we get $x - 2 = 8^2 = 64$, so $x = 64 + 2 = \boxed{66}$.
We want to subtract 7/6 from 2
To do this, we get a common denominator of 6
We get \[
2-\frac{7}{6} = \frac{12}{6}-\frac{7}{6}=\frac{12-7}{6}=\boxed{\frac{5}{6}}.
$\text A=\text{BC}=(3\text D)(5\text E)=(3(3\cdot2))(5(5\cdot2))=3^2\cdot2^2\cdot5^2=3^2\cdot10^2=\boxed{900}$.
Our tasks are to sum the heights and count the number of heights
There is 1 height in the 40s, 6 heights in the 50s, and 8 heights in the 60s
The sum of these $1+6+8=15$ heights is $1\times40+6\times50+8\times60$ plus the sum of all the units digits listed in the stem-and-leaf plot
The sum is 900 inches and the average height is $900\text{ in.}/15=\boxed{60}$ inches.
We have $\angle K = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 60^\circ = 30^\circ$, so $JKL$ is a 30-60-90 triangle
Since $\overline{JL}$ is opposite the $30^\circ$ angle, we have $JL = KL/2 = 10$
Since $\overline{JK}$ is opposite the $60^\circ$ angle, we have $JK = JL\sqrt{3} = 10\sqrt{3}$
Therefore, \[[JKL] = \frac{(JK)(JL)}{2} = \frac{(10\sqrt{3})(10)}{2} = \boxed{50\sqrt{3}}.\]
1821 is clearly not even, so 2 is not a factor
We find that 3 is a factor, since the sum of the digits of 1821 is $1 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 12$, which is divisible by 3
Since we want the smallest prime factor, we are done; our answer is $\boxed{3}$.

If a circle makes one complete revolution, the point $P$ moves to $P'$ and the distance $PP'$ is the circumference of the circle, or $2 \pi\text{ m}.$
If we now complete the rectangle, we can see that the distance the center travels is $CC'$ which is exactly equal to $PP'$ or $\boxed{2 \pi}$ meters.
First, we must find the mean and median of the values
In order to find the mean, we sum all the values and divide the result by the number of values: \begin{align*} \frac{165+119+138+300+198}{5} &= 184
\end{align*} in order to find the median, we must first list the values in order from least to greatest: \[ 119, 138, 165, 198, 300
\] There are $5$ values, so the median is the middle value, which here is $165.$
So, the positive difference between the mean and the median is $184-165=\boxed{19}.$
Among the 10 letters in the word MATHCOUNTS, the 5 letters, A, T, H, C, and T appear in the word TEACH
The probability of drawing one of these tiles is $\dfrac{5}{10}=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
To check if a number is divisible by 4, we only need to check if its last two digits are divisible by 4
In this case, the last two digits of 1,493,824 are 24, which is divisible by 4
Thus, the remainder is $\boxed{0}$.
We distribute the negative sign so the expression becomes \[
(2-3z) - (3+4z) = 2-3z-3-4z=2-3-3z-4z = \boxed{-1-7z}.

The minimum number of people who like both Mozart and Bach is achieved when the number of people who like Mozart but not Bach is maximized
There are $100-70=30$ people who do not like Bach
If all these people like Mozart, then the number of people who like Bach and Mozart is $87-30=\boxed{57}$.
There are 5 choices for President, and then 4 choices (the remaining four people) for Vice-President, so there are $5 \times 4 = \boxed{20}$ choices for the two officers.

[/asy] Then the perimeter of $PQRS$ equals $8x$, so $8x = 120$ cm or $x = 15$ cm.
Since $PQRS$ is made up of three squares of side length 15 cm, then its area is  $3(15)^2 = 3(225) = \boxed{675}$ square centimeters.

There are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour mark is $360^\circ/12 = 30^\circ$ from its neighbors
At 7:00, the minute hand points at the 12, while the hour hand points at hour 7
So, the hands are 5 "hours" apart, which means that the angle between the hands is $5\cdot 30^\circ = \boxed{150^\circ}$.
By the order of operations, first simplify the expressions inside of each of the brackets
The first one, $[(2+3+4+5)\div2]$ is equal to $14\div2$.
The second bracket can also be simplified through the use of the order of operations
(2\cdot5+8)\div3 = 18\div3 = 6.
\]  Therefore,    \[
[(2+3+4+5)\div2] + [(2\cdot5+8)\div3] = [7] + [6] = 7+6 = \boxed{13}.
The sum of the interior angles of this pentagon is $(5-2)\cdot180=540$ degrees
Thus, we have the equation $540=(x+1)+2x+3x+4x+(5x-1)\Rightarrow 540 = 15x \Rightarrow x=36$
The largest angle has measure $5x-1$, or $5\cdot36-1=\boxed{179}$ degrees.
Since 45 minutes is $\frac{3}{4}$ of an hour, the Powerjet will pump $420\times\frac{3}{4}=\boxed{315}$ gallons of water in 45 minutes.
Note that $144$ is a multiple of $2^4$ and $3^2$ since    $$144 = 16 \cdot 9 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2.$$Note that $2^5 = 32$ is not a factor of $144$ since dividing $144$ by $32$ gives a remainder of $16$
Similarly, $3^3 = 27$ is not a factor of $144$ since dividing $144$ by $27$ gives a remainder of $9$.
It follows that $2^4$ is the greatest power of $2$ that is a factor of $144$, and that $3^2$ is the greatest power of $3$ that is a factor of $144$
So $x = 4$ and $y = 2$
So our final answer is   \begin{align*}
\left( \frac 15 \right)^{2 - 4} &= \left( \frac 15 \right)^{-2}\\
&= \left(\left( \frac 15 \right)^{-1}\right)^2\\
&= 5^2\\
&= \boxed{25}.
\end{align*}
We have:
$\sqrt{7\cdot 2}\cdot \sqrt{2^3\cdot 7^3}=\sqrt{2^4\cdot 7^4}=\sqrt{14^4}=14^2=\boxed{196}$.
Divide the larger square into 8 congruent triangles, as shown, 4 of which make up the smaller square
pair a=(0,1),b=(1,0),c=(0,-1),d=(-1,0);
draw((-1,-1)--(-1,1)--(1,1)--(1,-1)--cycle);
filldraw(a--b--c--d--cycle, lightred, black);
draw(d--b, linetype("8 8"));
draw(a--c, linetype("8 8"));
label("$A$", a, N);
label("$B$", b, E);
label("$C$", c, S);
label("$D$", d, W);
[/asy] The area of the smaller square is $\frac{4}{8}$ or $\frac{1}{2}$ of the area of the larger square, so the area of the smaller square is equal to $\boxed{30}$.
First, divide out 9 to obtain $999=9\cdot111$
Since $1+1+1=3$, 111 is divisible by 3
Dividing, we find $111=3\cdot 37$
Therefore, $999=3^2\cdot 3\cdot 37=3^3\cdot 37$ and the largest prime factor of 999 is $\boxed{37}$.
Let $n$ be the number of sides in the polygon
The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees
Since each angle in the given polygon measures $120^\circ$, the sum of the interior angles of this polygon is also $120n$
Therefore, we must have  \[180(n-2) = 120n.\] Expanding the left side gives $180n - 360 = 120n$, so $60n = 360$ and $n = \boxed{6}$.
We might also have noted that each exterior angle of the given polygon measures $180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ$
The exterior angles of a polygon sum to $360^\circ$, so there must be $\frac{360^\circ}{60^\circ} = 6$ of them in the polygon.
The least number of marbles that the set could have is the least common multiple of $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$
Prime factorizing these five numbers, we find that \begin{align*}
2 &= 2 \\
3 &= 3 \\
4 &= 2^2 \\
5 &= 5 \\
6 &= 2 \cdot 3.
\end{align*}For a number to be divisible by each of these numbers, its prime factorization must include 2 to the second power, 3, and 5
So the least common multiple is $2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = \boxed{60}$.
If 4 is subtracted from 109, the result is 105
Then each of the two-digit numbers that will divide 109 with a remainder of 4 will divide 105 exactly
Thus, the problem is equivalent to finding all two-digit divisors of 105
Since the prime factors of 105 are 3, 5, and 7, the divisors are $3\times5$, $3\times7$, and $5\times7$, or $15, 21,\text{and }35$ with a sum of $\boxed{71}$.
The factors of 342 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 19, 38, 57, 114, 171, and 342
The factors of 285 are 1, 3, 5, 15, 19, 57, 95, and 285
By comparing the two lists, we can see that the numbers that are factors of both 342 and 285 are 1, 3, 19, and 57
So, the largest divisor of both 342 and 285 is $\boxed{57}$.
Since there are 30 students and a mean of 5 candies per student, there are a total of $5 \cdot 30 = 150$ pieces of candy
Since every student must take at least one piece of candy, the first 29 students must take a total of at least 29 pieces
Since $150 - 29 = 121$, the greatest number of pieces one student can take is $\boxed{121}$.
Begin by factoring the two numbers
$400$ factors into $2^4\cdot5^2$, while $576$ factors into $2^6\cdot3^2$
In order for $400x$ to be a multiple of $576$, the prime factorization of $400x$ must include the entire prime factorization of $576$
Since the prime factorization of 576 has two more 2's and two more 3's than the prime factorization of 400, we know that the prime factorization of $x$ must include at least two 2's and at least two 3's
So, the smallest possible $x$ is $2^2\cdot3^2=4\cdot9=\boxed{36}$.
Checking our answer to make sure that $400\cdot (2^2\cdot 3^2)$ is a multiple of 576, we see that $$400(2^2\cdot 3^2) =2^4\cdot 5^2\cdot 2^2\cdot 3^2 = 5^2(2^4\cdot 2^2\cdot 3^2) = 5^2(2^6\cdot 3^2) = 25\cdot 576.$$
$128=2^7$ and $144=12^2=2^4 \cdot 3^2,$ so the greatest common divisor of the three numbers is at most $2^4=16$
In fact, $480$ is divisible by $16,$ so $\boxed{16}$ is the greatest common divisor of the three numbers.
Carrying out prime factorization, $30=2\cdot3\cdot5$ and $81=3^4$
Taking the least power of each prime that appears in these two factorizations, we find that the greatest common divisor is $2^0\cdot3^1\cdot 5^0=3$
Taking the highest power of each prime that appears , we find that the least common multiple of $36=2^2\cdot3^2$ and $12=2^2\cdot3$ is $2^2\cdot3^2=36$
Their sum is $3+36=\boxed{39}$.
We have $\text{lassis}:\text{mangoes} = 11:2$
Multiplying both parts of the ratio by 6 gives \[\text{lassis}:\text{mangoes} = 11:2 = 66:12,\]so she can make $\boxed{66}$ lassis.
The sum $12+10$ counts twice the businessmen who drank both coffee and tea
Since there are 5 such businessmen, we must subtract 5 from the sum $12+10$ to only count these businessmen once
Therefore, a total of $12+10-5=17$ businessmen drank either coffee or tea
So, $25-17=\boxed{8}$ businessmen drank neither coffee nor tea.
The prime months are February, March, May, July, and November
Of these, February had 28 days in 2007; March, May, and July had 31 days; and November had 30
In February, there were 9 prime dates
In March, May, and July, there were 11 prime dates
In November there were 10 prime dates
There were $\boxed{52}$ prime dates total in 2007.
Since $\sqrt{x+7} = 9$, we know that 9 is the number whose square is $x+7$
Therefore, we have \[x+7 = 9^2.\] This gives us $x + 7= 81$, so $x= \boxed{74}$.
We can simplify each square root first: $\sqrt{338}=\sqrt{2\cdot169}=13\sqrt2$, $\sqrt{288}=\sqrt{2\cdot144}=12\sqrt2$, $\sqrt{150}=\sqrt{6\cdot25}=5\sqrt6$, and $\sqrt{96}=\sqrt{6\cdot16}=4\sqrt6$
Now we can cancel a lot: $$\dfrac{13\sqrt2}{12\sqrt2}+\dfrac{5\sqrt6}{4\sqrt6}=\dfrac{13}{12}+\dfrac54=\dfrac{13+15}{12}=\dfrac{28}{12}=\boxed{\frac{7}{3}}.$$
Suppose Sasha has $q$ quarters
Then she also has $q$ nickels, and the total value of her quarters and nickels is $.25q + .05q = .30q$
Since $3.20/0.30 = 10\frac{2}{3}$, this means that she has at most $\boxed{10}$ quarters
(This amount is obtainable; for example we can let the rest of her coins be pennies.)
$n+(n+1)+(n+2)=3n+3$
So $3n+3=9\Rightarrow n=\boxed{2}$.
Each switch has three connections
So, with twenty switches, there would seem to be $20 \cdot 3 = 60$ connections
However, each connection corresponds to two switches
Thus, there are $\frac{20\cdot 3}{2} = \boxed{30}$ connections.
There are four ways to choose the first cook and three ways to choose the second cook, but this counts every pair of cooks twice since order doesn't matter
Once the cooks are chosen, the two people left over are the cleaners
So, there are $(4\cdot 3)/2=\boxed{6}$ ways for us to choose who cooks and who cleans.
We need to count the number of two-digit integers with odd tens digit and even units digit that are greater than $65.$ Notice that the only two possibilities for the tens digit are $7$ and $9.$ For each of these, the units digits $0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ and $8$ are all possible, for a total of $5$ choices
Therefore there are $2\cdot 5=10$ possible integers to choose from
Since there are $10$ integers to choose from, the probability of selecting the right one is $\boxed{\frac{1}{10}}.$
For your information, the possible numbers are $$\{ 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98 \}.$$
For each fabric color, the designer can choose one of four patterns
Thus, as there are three potential fabric colors, the designer can create $3 \cdot 4 = \boxed{12}$ different dress designs.
We can make an inequality with the number of popsicles being the variable $x$.
$1.60 \cdot x < 19.23$
Dividing 19.23 by 1.60, we find that the integer part of the quotient is 12
In particular, we have $1.60 \cdot 12 = 19.2$
So she can buy at most $\boxed{12}$ popsicles.
Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\circ,$ then \begin{align*}
\angle QPS &= 180^\circ - \angle PQS - \angle PSQ \\
&= 180^\circ - 48^\circ - 38^\circ \\
&= 94^\circ.
\end{align*}Therefore, \begin{align*}
\angle RPS &= \angle QPS - \angle QPR \\
&= 94^\circ - 67^\circ \\
&= \boxed{27^\circ}.
\end{align*}
The 10 in the numerator and the 55 in the denominator have a common factor of 5
Similarly, the $a^3$ and $a^2$ have a common factor of $a^2$
So we get \[
\frac{10a^3}{55a^2} = \frac{2\cdot 5\cdot a^2\cdot a^1}{11\cdot 5 \cdot a^2} = \frac{2\cdot \cancel{5}\cdot \cancel{a^2}\cdot a^1}{11\cdot \cancel{5} \cdot \cancel{a^2}} = \frac{2a}{11}.
\]Substituting $a=3$ gives $\boxed{\frac{6}{11}}$.
When 12 is divisible by $n$, the least common multiple of 12 and $n$ is simply 12
Therefore, we know that $\operatorname{lcm}[12,2]=12$, $\operatorname{lcm}[12,4]=12$, $\operatorname{lcm}[12,6]=12$, and $\operatorname{lcm}[12,12]=12$.
Since $12=2^2\cdot 3$ and $8=2^3$, the least common multiple of 12 and 8 is $2^3\cdot 3 = 24$
Thus, $\operatorname{lcm}[12,8]=24$
Finally, 10 introduces a prime factor of 5 into the least common multiple, which makes $\operatorname{lcm}[12,10]=2^2\cdot 3 \cdot 5 = \boxed{60}$, which is larger than the other least common multiples.
$\frac{8}{6}=\frac{4}{3}$ so 8 gallons is $4/3$ as much gas as 6 gallons is
Since the distance that a car can travel is directly proportional to the amount of gas that it has, if a car can travel $192$ miles on 6 gallons of gas, it can travel $192 \cdot \frac{4}{3}=64 \cdot 4 = \boxed{256}$ miles on 8 gallons of gas.
Begin by factoring $24$ and $48$
We have $24=2^3\cdot3$ and $48=2^4\cdot3$, so $$7\cdot24\cdot48=7\cdot(2^3\cdot3)\cdot(2^4\cdot3)=2^7\cdot3^2\cdot7.$$For a number to be a perfect cube, every prime factor must have an exponent that is a multiple of $3$
The next multiple of $3$ bigger than $7$ is $9$, so we need a $2^2$ to reach $9$ in the exponent
We need one more factor of $3$ to reach $3^3$
We need another $7^2$ to reach $3$ in the exponent of $7$
This gives a smallest number of $2^2\cdot3\cdot7^2=\boxed{588}$.
In general, 5 CDs will cost $\frac{5}{2}$ times as much as 2 CDs
Thus the desired cost is $28\cdot \frac{5}{2} = \boxed{70}$ dollars.
Rather than finding the prime factorization of $5!$ and $7!$, we note that  \[7! = 7\cdot 6\cdot 5 \cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 7\cdot 6\cdot 5!.\]Therefore, $7!$ is a multiple of $5!$, which means that $5!$ is the greatest common divisor of $5!$ and $7!$ (since it is a divisor of $7!$ and is the largest divisor of $5!$)
So, we have  \[5! = 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1 = \boxed{120}.\]
First, we consider the triangles that have the vertices of the rectangle $ABCD$ as the right angle
We can get $2$ right triangles for each vertex
For example, for vertex $A$, we can get right triangles $DAP$ and $DAB$
Since there are four vertices, we can get $2 \cdot 4 =8$ right triangles.
Next, we consider triangles that have $P$ or $Q$ as the vertices
We can set $PQ$ as a leg of the right triangles and get $4$ right triangles with the third vertex $A,B,C$, and $D$.
Lastly, we can draw the diagonals $DP, CP, AQ$, and $BQ$
Since $ADQP$ and $BCQP$ are squares, each diagonal creates a $45$ degree angle with the line segment $PQ$
Therefore, we have two right triangles: $DPC$ and $AQB$.
Adding them together, we have a total of $$8+4+2=\boxed{14 \text{ right triangles}}.$$
36.89753 is between 36.8 and 36.9, so rounding to the nearest tenth will give either 36.8 or 36.9
0.09753 is greater than 0.05, therefore 36.89753 rounded to the nearest tenth is $\boxed{36.9}$.
Since the 5 numbers have a mean of 11, the sum of the numbers is $5\cdot 11 = 55$
To make the largest number as large as possible, we make the other numbers must be as small as possible
However, in order for the median to be 3, the middle number must be 3
Since this is the middle number, there must be two other numbers that are at least 3
So, we let three of the other four numbers be 1, 1, and 3 to make them as small as possible
Finally, this means the remaining number is $55-1-1-3-3=\boxed{47}$.
Only the $8$ corners of the cube have three faces painted red
Each edge has one cube that has $2$ faces painted red
There are $12$ edges, so $12$ cubes have $2$ faces painted red
Each of the six faces has only the center cube painted on exactly $1$ face, and the single cube in the center of the three-inch cube is the only one with no faces painted
We can thus produce the following table: $$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Number of red faces} & \textbf{Number of one-inch cubes} \\
\hline
\ast3 & 8 \\
\hline
\ast2 & 12 \\
\hline
1 & 6 \\
\hline
0 & 1 \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{
\text{Total = 27}}\\
\hline
\end{array}
$$$\ast$ Number of cubes with $2$ or $3$ red faces is $8 + 12 = \boxed{20}.$
We list the divisors of 18 by finding them in pairs
We begin with 1 and 18 on the ends, so our list is \[
1 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \ldots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 18.
\]Then we check 2, finding that $2\times 9 = 18$
Our list becomes \[
1 \quad 2 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \ldots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 9 \quad 18.
\]Checking 3, we get $3\times 6=18$, so we get \[
1 \quad 2 \quad 3\quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \ldots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 6 \quad 9 \quad 18.
\]We check 4 and find that 18 is not divisible by 4
Similarly, 18 is not divisible by 5
Since 6 is already on the list, we're finished
The list of the positive divisors of 18 is \[
1 \quad 2 \quad 3\quad 6 \quad 9 \quad 18.
\]The sum of these numbers is $1+2+3+6+9+18 = \boxed{39}$.
There are 4 choices for the first digit and 3 for the second, for a total of $4\cdot3=\boxed{12}$ integers possible.
Let's consider building such an arrangement
We can choose the first letter in 5 ways
After we have chosen the first letter, we can choose the second in 4 ways
Similarly, the third letter then has 3 ways of being chosen, the second letter 2, and the last letter only 1
Thus the total number of arrangements is $5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1 = \boxed{120}$.
Squaring the square root of any number gives that number back
Therefore \[\left(\sqrt{(\sqrt3)^3}\right)^4=\left({\color{red}\left(\sqrt{{\color{black}(\sqrt3)^3}}\right)^2}\right)^2=\left((\sqrt3)^3\right)^2=(\sqrt3)^6.\] Again, squaring the square root gives the original number back so  \[(\sqrt3)^6=\left((\sqrt3)^2\right)^3=3^3=\boxed{27}.\]
We can solve this with a Venn diagram
First we notice that there are 9 people with both cool dads and cool moms.
label("Cool Dad", (2,75));
label("Cool Mom", (80,75));
draw(Circle((30,45), 22));
draw(Circle((58, 45), 22));
label(scale(0.8)*"$9$", (44, 45));
//label(scale(0.8)*"$33$",(28,45));
//label(scale(0.8)*"$23$",(63,45));
//label(scale(0.8)*"$17$", (70, 15));
[/asy]
Since 12 people have cool dads and 9 of those have cool moms, too, $12-9=3$ of the people have cool dads and uncool moms
Likewise, $15-9=6$ people have cool moms and uncool dads.
label("Cool Dad", (2,75));
label("Cool Mom", (80,75));
draw(Circle((30,45), 22));
draw(Circle((58, 45), 22));
label(scale(0.8)*"$9$", (44, 45));
label(scale(0.8)*"$3$",(28,45));
label(scale(0.8)*"$6$",(63,45));
//label(scale(0.8)*"$17$", (70, 15));
[/asy]
This means that $3+9+6=18$ people have at least one cool parent
That leaves $30-18=\boxed{12}$ sad people with a pair of uncool parents.
Of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, only the numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime.
Since 4 out of the 6 numbers are prime, then the probability of choosing a ball with a prime number is $\frac{4}{6} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
We use long division to find that the decimal representation of $\frac{5}{7}$ is $0.\overline{714285}$, which is a repeating block of $\boxed{6}$ digits.
Since $\dfrac{3}{4}$ of the parrots are green and the rest are blue, then $1-\dfrac{3}{4} = \dfrac{1}{4}$ of the parrots are blue
Since there are 92 parrots total, there must be $\dfrac{1}{4}(92) = \boxed{23}$ blue parrots.
$\frac{200 \text{ pages}}{17 \text{ pages per minute}} \approx \boxed{12}$ minutes.
$40=2^3\cdot5$ and $48=2^4\cdot3$
The prime factorization of their greatest common factor cannot contain any other primes besides 2 raised to no more than the 3rd power, otherwise it would not be a factor of both numbers
Thus, their GCF is $2^3=\boxed{8}$.
The first multiple of $10$ greater than $9$ is $10$, and the last multiple of $10$ less than $101$ is $100$
The list of multiples of $10$ proceeds: $10$, $20$, $\ldots$, $100$
Divide each number by $10$, and the list becomes $1$, $2$, $\ldots$, $10$
It is easy to see that the number of numbers in this list is $\boxed{10}$.
There are 17 times, so the median time will be the ninth when the times are listed from least time to most time
Fortunately, the stem-and-leaf plot gives us the times in order
For example, the first time is 0 minutes and 28 seconds, the second time is also 0 minutes and 28 seconds, and so on
The ninth time is 2 minutes and 43 seconds
Converting to seconds gives $2 \cdot 60 + 43 = \boxed{163}$ seconds.
For each shirt that you choose, you can choose one of four pairs of pants
Thus, because you can choose one of three shirts, there are $3 \cdot 4 = \boxed{12}$ possible outfits.
Choose $k$ so that the smallest angle measures $5k$ degrees
Then the measures of the other two angles are $6k$ degrees and $7k$ degrees
Since the measures of the angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have $5k+6k+7k=180\implies 18k=180\implies k=10$
The smallest angle measures $5k=5(10)=\boxed{50}$ degrees.
$14=2\cdot7$ and $21=3\cdot7$, so the LCM of 14 and 21 is $2\cdot3\cdot7=\boxed{42}$.
You can think of the money being split into $2+3+3+5$ parts, and each partner getting his corresponding number of parts as his share
That makes for a total of 13 parts, meaning that each part consists of $\$2,\!000,$ and the largest share received is $5\cdot 2,\!000 = \boxed{10,\!000}$.
$6=2\cdot3$, $8=2^3$, and $10=2\cdot5$, so the least common multiple of 6, 8, and 10 is $2^3\cdot3\cdot5=\boxed{120}$.
The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we must have \[\angle M + \angle A + \angle T + \angle H + \angle S = 540^\circ.\] Since $\angle A$ and $\angle S$ are supplementary, we have $\angle A +\angle S = 180^\circ$
Combining this with $\angle H = \angle M = \angle T$, we have \begin{align*}
\angle M + \angle A + \angle T + \angle H + \angle S& =
(\angle M + \angle T + \angle H) \\
&\qquad+ (\angle A +\angle S) \\
&= 3\angle H + 180^\circ,\end{align*} so $3\angle H + 180^\circ = 540^\circ$
Therefore, $3\angle H = 360^\circ$ and $\angle H = \boxed{120^\circ}$.
Simplify to get
$$\dfrac{8!}{70}=\dfrac{8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1}{2\cdot5\cdot7}=8\cdot6\cdot4\cdot3=2^6 \cdot 3^2.$$Now, we can take the square root by raising to the power $\dfrac12$:
$$\sqrt{2^6 \cdot 3^2}=(2^6 \cdot 3^2)^\frac12=2^\frac62 \cdot 3^\frac22=2^3 \cdot 3=\boxed{24}.$$
The interior angle of a square is 90, and the interior angle of a hexagon is 120, making for a sum of $\boxed{210}$
If you don't have the interior angles memorized, you can calculate them using the following formula: $180\left(\frac{n-2}{n}\right),$ where $n$ is the number of sides in the polygon.

There are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour mark is $360^\circ/12 = 30^\circ$ from its neighbors
At 6:44, the minute hand points at minute 44, which is $\frac45$ of the way from hour 8 to hour 9
Therefore, the minute hand is $\frac45\cdot 30^\circ = 24^\circ$ past hour 8
The hour hand is $\frac{44}{60} = \frac{11}{15}$ of the way from hour 6 to hour 7, so it is $\frac{11}{15}\cdot 30^\circ = 22^\circ$ past hour 6
This means that the hour hand is $30^\circ -22^\circ = 8^\circ$ from hour 7
Since hours 7 and 8 are $30^\circ$ apart, the total angle between the two hands is $8^\circ + 30^\circ + 24^\circ = \boxed{62^\circ}$.
By the order of operations, we perform the multiplications before the additions and subtractions: \begin{align*}
9-8+7\times 6 +5-4\times 3+2-1 &= 9-8+42 +5-12 + 2 -1\\
&=1 + 42 +5-12 + 2-1\\
&=48-12 + 2 -1\\
&= 36 +1 = \boxed{37}.
\end{align*}
Since $b+c=5$ and $c=3$, we have $b=2$.
So $a+b=c$ becomes
$$a+2=3\Rightarrow a=\boxed{1}$$
Calculating, $\frac{7}{9}=7\div 9=0.7777\cdots=0.\overline{7}$
Rounded to 2 decimal places, $\frac{7}{9}$ is $\boxed{0.78}$.
The number $2345N$ is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.
The number $2345N$ is divisible by 2 if and only if its last digit $N$ is even, so $N$ must be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
The number $2345N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, which is $2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + N = N + 14$
We see that $N + 14$ is divisible by 3 if and only if $N$ is one of the digits 1, 4, or 7.
Therefore, there is in fact only one digit $N$ for which $2345N$ is divisible by 6, namely $N = \boxed{4}$.
Recall that division is the same as multiplication by a reciprocal
In other words, if $b$ is nonzero, then $a \div b = a\cdot \frac{1}{b}$
In this case, \[
\frac{2}{5}\div 3 = \frac{2}{5}\cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2\cdot 1}{5\cdot 3}=\boxed{\frac{2}{15}}.
A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits are divisible by 4
The only given number that is not divisible by 4 is 3554 because 54 is not divisible by 4
The product of the units digit and the tens digit of 3554 is $5\cdot 4=\boxed{20}$.
Dividing $1000$ by $15$ gives a quotient of $66$ with a remainder of $10.$ In other words, \[1000=15\cdot66+10.\]So, $66\cdot15$ is the largest three-digit multiple of $15,$ and $67\cdot15=\boxed{1005}$ is the smallest four-digit multiple.
There are 3 dogs for every 2 cats, and there are $14/2=7$ sets of 2 cats
Therefore, there are $3(7)=\boxed{21\text{ dogs}}$.
The kite can be divided into two triangles, each with base 7 and altitude 3
Each area is $(1/2)(7)(3) = 10.5$, so the total area is $2(10.5) = \boxed{21}$ square inches.
Let $x$ be the measure of $\angle 1$, so $8x$ is the measure of $\angle 2$
Since $m\parallel n$, we have $\angle 5 = \angle 1 = x$
Since $\angle 2$ and $\angle 5$ together form a straight line, we have $\angle 2 + \angle 5 = 180^\circ$, so $x+8x=180^\circ$
This gives us $9x = 180^\circ$, so $x= \boxed{20^\circ}$.
Jordan runs the last lap
There are three choices left for the person to run the first lap
After the first lap, there are then two choices for the person to run the second lap
The third lap must be run by the remaining team member.
The total number of ways for the team to run the relay is $3\cdot2\cdot1=\boxed{6}$.
To make this easier, you can scale all the student numbers down by a factor of 6: 5 students averaged a $72\%$, and 1 student got a $78\%$
Then, instead of adding that up, you note, since 5 students averaged a 72, and only 1 student got a 78, the class average should be 5 times closer to 72 than 78
And since $78 - 72 = 6$, we perfectly get $\boxed{73\%}$ as the class average, since $73 - 72 = 1$, and $78 - 73 = 5$.
There are 4 choices for which number can be in the hundreds place
For each possibility, there are 3 choices remaining for which number can be in the tens place, leaving 2 choices for the units place
This gives a total of $4\cdot 3\cdot 2 = \boxed{24}$ possible three-digit numbers.
In general, if the ratio of the perimeters of two similar figures is $a/b$, then the ratio of their areas is $(a/b)^2$
So in this case, $(a/b)^2 = 25/36$, or $a/b = 5/6$
So the answer is $\boxed{5:6}$.
By definition, the complement of an angle $\alpha$ is $90^\circ - \alpha$, and the supplement of an angle $\alpha$ is $180^\circ - \alpha$.
Thus, the complement of a 42-degree angle is $90 - 42 = 48$ degrees, and the supplement of a 48-degree angle is $180 - 48 = \boxed{132}$ degrees.
For the number to be divisible by 5, its units digit must be a 5 or a 0
In addition, for the number to be divisible by 2, the units digit must be even
Thus, $\textrm{A}$ must be $\boxed{0}$.
Note that when $\textrm{A}=0$, we also have the following:
* The sum of the digits of the number is 27, so the number is divisible by 3 and 9
* The number formed by the last two digits is 80, which is a multiple of 4, so the number is divisible by 4.
* The number is divisible by 2 and by 3, so it is divisible by 6.
* The number formed by the last three digits is 080, which is a multiple of 8, so the number is divisible by 8.
Note that 10 divides both 20 and 90
However, no bigger number can divide 20 except for 20, yet 20 does not divide 90
Therefore, 10 is the greatest common factor of 20 and 90
Similarly, note that 180 is a multiple of both 20 and 90, but the only smaller multiple of 90 is 90, so therefore 180 is the least common multiple of 20 and 90
Therefore, the product of the least common multiple and the greatest common factor of $20$ and $90$ is $10\cdot 180=\boxed{1800}$
Note that this product equals the product of 20 and 90
Is this a coincidence?
Recall that no perfect squares are negative, because squares of all negative numbers are positive and squares of positive numbers are also positive (and $0^2=0$)
Since all perfect squares are either $0$ or positive, the only two-digit perfect squares are: \begin{align*}
4^2&=16\\
5^2&=25\\
6^2&=36\\
7^2&=49\\
8^2&=64\\
9^2&=81
\end{align*} Out of these six perfect squares, only $36$ and $81$ are divisible by $3.$ Note that if a perfect square, $a^2,$ is divisible by $3,$ then $a$ also must have been divisible by $3,$ (as $6$ and $9$ in this case.) Therefore, $\boxed{2}$ perfect squares are two-digit and divisible by $3.$
The sale price is $70\%$ of the original price, or $\$7.00$
After the next reduction, the final price is one-half the sale price of $\$7.00$
or $\boxed{\$3.50}$.
The perimeter is $1000\div 10=100$, and this is two lengths and two widths
The length of the backyard is $1000\div 25=40$
Since two lengths total 80, the two widths total 20, and the width is 10
The area is $10\times 40=\boxed{400}$.
Suppose the radius of the circle is $r$ cm.
Then the area $M$ is $\pi r^2\text{ cm}^2$ and the circumference $N$ is $2\pi r\text{ cm}$.
Thus, $\frac{\pi r^2}{2\pi r} = 20$ or $\frac{r}{2}=20$ or $r=\boxed{40}$.
The smallest whole number in the interval is 2 because $\frac{5}{3}$ is more than 1 but less than 2
The largest whole number in the interval is 6 because $2\pi$ is more than 6 but less than 7
There are $\boxed{5}$ whole numbers in the interval
They are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
First we find the prime factorization of each number: $$18=2\times 9=2\times 3\times 3=2\times 3^2$$ and $$42=2\times 21=2\times 3\times 7.$$ The common factors are $2$ and $3,$ so $\gcd(18,42) = 2\times 3=6.$
The least common multiple is formed by multiplying together the highest powers of all primes occurring in the factorization of either $18$ or $42:$ $$\text{lcm}(18,42) = 2\times 3^2\times 7 = 2\times 9\times 7 = 2\times 63 = 126.$$ Thus, the product of the $\gcd$ and the $\text{lcm}$ is $6\times 126=\boxed{756}.$
(You can check that this product is equal to the product of the original two numbers, $18$ and $42$
Is that just a coincidence?)
$\bigtriangleup ABD$ is a 9 -12 -15 triangle, and $\bigtriangleup BCD$ is a 8 - 15 - 17 triangle, therefore, the areas of the two triangles are 54 and 60, respectively, and the area of $ABCD$ is the sum of these areas, a total of $\boxed{114\text{ square units}}$.
At 6:48, the minute hand is $\frac{12}{60}(360^\circ)=72$ degrees from the 12:00 position
The hour hand is $\frac{5\frac{12}{60}}{12}(360^\circ)=156$ degrees from the 12:00 position
The difference in the two positions is $156^\circ-72^\circ=\boxed{84}$ degrees.
To subtract fractions, you must have a common denominator
In this case, since 51 is a multiple of 17, the common denominator is 51
So we get \[\frac{7\cdot3}{17\cdot3} - \frac{4}{51} = \frac{21}{51} - \frac{4}{51}.\]Using the distributive law, we can simplify this to \[\frac{21 - 4}{51} = \frac{17}{51}.\]But $\frac{17}{51}$ can be written as $\frac{17\cdot1}{17\cdot3}$, so our final answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
Since the area of the larger circle is $64\pi$ and each circle is divided into two equal areas, the larger shaded area is $\frac{1}{2}$ of $64\pi,$ or $32\pi.$
Let $r$ be the radius of the larger circle.
Since the area of the larger circle is $64\pi$ and $r>0,$ we have \begin{align*}
\pi r^2 &= 64\pi \\
r^2 &= 64 \\
r &= \sqrt{64} = 8.
\end{align*}Since the smaller circle passes through the center of the larger circle and just touches the outer circle, by symmetry, its diameter must equal the radius of the larger circle
(In other words, if we join the center of the larger circle to the point where the two circles just touch, this line will be a radius of the larger circle and a diameter of the smaller circle.)
Therefore, the diameter of the smaller circle is $8,$ so its radius is $4.$
Therefore, the area of the smaller circle is $\pi(4^2)=16\pi,$ so the smaller shaded area is $\frac{1}{2}\times 16\pi$ or $8\pi.$
Therefore, the total of the shaded areas is $32\pi+8\pi=\boxed{40\pi}.$
A circle's radius is half its diameter, so if the diameter of a circle is 4 meters, then its radius is 2 meters
The area of the circle is $\pi(\text{radius})^2=\pi(2\text{ m})^2=\boxed{4\pi}$ square meters.
Dividing by $4$, we have $0<n<7\frac{1}{2}$
The integer solutions to this chain of inequalities are $n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7$
The sum of these integers is $\boxed{28}$.
Filling in the squares from the bottom of the pyramid to the top, we have the following:  [asy]

[/asy] Since the two blocks directly under the top block $46$ say $n+16$ and $27$, we know that $(n+16)+27=46$
Solving this equation, we have that $n=\boxed{3}$.
First, we wish to determine what percentage of the tons of apples are used for apple juice
After $20\%$ is mixed with other products, $80\%$ remains
Half of this is used for apple juice; therefore, $40\%$ of the tons of apples is used for apple juice
To calculate $40\%$ of $5.5$ million tons, we find $10\%$ and then multiply by four
$10\% = 0.55$, and $0.55 \cdot 4 = 2.2$
Thus, $\boxed{2.2}$ million tons are used for apple juice.
There are 26 choices of letters for each of the first two spots, and 10 choices of digits for each of the next 3, for a total of $26^2 \times 10^3 = \boxed{676,\!000}$ different plates.
Adding the number of students in the band and the number of students in the chorus gives $70+95 = 165$
But we are told that there are only 150 students in band and/or chorus, so our 165 must count $165-150 = 15$ students twice, once for the band and once for the chorus
Therefore, there are $\boxed{15}$ students in both.
The areas of the four circles are $\pi, 9\pi, 25\pi$ and $49\pi$
The areas of the two black regions are $\pi$ and $25\pi - 9\pi = 16\pi$, for a total black area of $\pi + 16\pi = 17\pi$
The areas of the two white regions are $9\pi - \pi = 8\pi$ and $49\pi - 25\pi = 24\pi$, for a total white area of $8\pi + 24\pi = 32\pi$
The ratio of the black area to the white area is $17\pi/32\pi = \boxed{\frac{17}{32}}.$

The red triangle we've drawn has angles $30^\circ$, $30^\circ$, and  \[180^\circ-30^\circ-30^\circ=120^\circ.\]
Since $x$ is the exterior angle at the $120^\circ$ vertex, the measure of $x$ is  \[180^\circ-120^\circ=\boxed{60^\circ}.\]
Recall that $(-a)^3=-a^3$
Thus, our second sum can be rewritten as  $$ (-1^3) + (-2^3) + (-3^3) + (-4^3) + \dots + (-99^3) + (-100^3).$$When we add this with  $$1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + \dots + 99^3 + 100^3, $$we can pair the terms conveniently: \[1^3 + (-1^3) + 2^3 + (-2^3)+ 3^3 + (-3^3) + \dots + 100^3 + (-100^3)
\]Because any number plus its negation is zero, each of these pairs of terms sum to zero, and the sum of the entire sequence is $\boxed{0}$.
First, 4 daps are equivalent to 3 dops: $$\frac{4 \mbox{ daps}}{3 \mbox{ dops}} = 1$$ Second, 2 dops are equivalent to 7 dips: $$ \frac{2 \mbox{ dops}}{7 \mbox{ dips}} = 1$$ Hence, 8 daps are equivalent to 21 dips: $$ \frac{4 \mbox{ daps}}{3 \mbox{ dops}}\cdot \frac{2 \mbox{ dops}}{7 \mbox{ dips}} = \frac{8 \mbox{ daps}}{21 \mbox{ dips}} = 1$$ Conveniently, $42$ dips is exactly twice $21$ dips
So, $\boxed{16\text{ daps}}$ are equivalent to $42$ dips.
Instead of calculating the area by subdividing into smaller regions, let us calculate the area of the large rectangle, and then subtract the small square cut out
The total area of the rectangle is $15 \times 12 = 180$, and the area of the small square is $3\times 3 = 9$, making for an area of $180 - 9 = \boxed{171}$ square feet inside the fence.
The sum of the angle measures of a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we must have \[\angle P + 111^\circ + 113^\circ + 92^\circ + 128^\circ = 540^\circ.\] Simplifying this equation gives $\angle P + 444^\circ = 540^\circ$, which means $\angle P = \boxed{96^\circ}$.
A convex $n$-gon has $\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ diagonals
Thus, a convex decagon has $\frac{10\cdot 7}{2} = \boxed{35}$ diagonals.
Since 1 and 2 are used at least once in half of the apartments, and no other number is used this often, either 1 or 2 will be the most frequent digit used.
Notice, though, that since all of the numbers of the form $\star1\star$ appear but only 6 of the numbers $\star2\star$ appear, 2 will be used less often than 1 and we should count the number of 1s to find the number of packages needed.
100 through 125 requires 26 ones just for the hundreds place
100 through 125 and 200 through 225 require the same number of ones for the tens and units places; that is, thirteen.
So, there are $26 + 2 \cdot 13 = 52$ ones used
Therefore, the landlord must purchase $\boxed{52}$ packages.
Recall that multiplication and division should be done in order from left to right before addition and subtraction
We have \begin{align*}4\cdot 6+8\cdot 3-28\div 2&=24+24-14.\end{align*}  Now, we rewrite the subtraction as the addition of a negation so that we can use the properties of addition to rearrange the numbers and make the arithmetic easier
We get \begin{align*}24+24-14&=24+24+(-14) \\ &=24+(-14)+24 \\ &=24-14+24 \\ &=10+24 \\ &=\boxed{34}.\end{align*}
The only three teams that won more than 20 games won 25, 30, and 35 games
Since the Patriots and the Mounties both won more games than the Cubs, the Cubs must have won 25 games
Since the Mounties won more games than the Patriots, the Mounties won 35 games and the Patriots won $\boxed{30}$ games.
Since $52\,28\square$ is a multiple of 6, then it must be a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3.
Since it is a multiple of 2, the digit represented by $\square$ must be even
Since it is a multiple of 3, the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
The sum of its digits is $5+2+2+8+\square = 17+\square$.
Since $\square$ is even, the possible sums of digits are 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 (for the possible values 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 for $\square$).
Of these possibilities, only 21 is divisible by 3, so $\square$ must equal $\boxed{4}$.
We can check that $52\,284$ is divisible by 6.
(An alternate approach would have been to use a calculator and test each of the  five possible values for $\square$ by dividing the resulting values of $52\,28\square$ by 6.)
We have $20 = \frac59(F-32)$
Multiplying both sides by 9 to get rid of the fraction gives  \[9\cdot 20 = 9\cdot \frac59 (F-32),\] so $180 = 5(F-32)$
We could distribute on the right-hand side, but it's a bit faster to divide both sides by 5, giving $36 = F-32$
Adding 32 to both sides gives $F = \boxed{68}$.
Since $\overline{AB}\parallel\overline{CD}$, we have $\angle B+ \angle C = 180^\circ$
Since $\angle C = 3\angle B$, we have $\angle B + 3\angle B = 180^\circ$, so $4\angle B = 180^\circ$, which means $\angle B = 180^\circ/4 = \boxed{45^\circ}$.

Of the numbers from $1$ to $24$, eight of them are multiples of $3$, so that gives us an exponent of $8$.
Now, two of the numbers are multiples of $3^2=9$, so each of them has $3$ as a factor twice
We've already counted them one each, so we need to count them each one more time
This adds another $2$ to the exponent.
The next thing to check is whether any of the numbers have $3$ as a factor three times
Happily, $3^3=27>24$, so we don't have any of those.
Our total exponent is $8+2=\boxed{10}$.
Let the diagonals have length $3x$ and $2x$
Half the product of the diagonals of a rhombus is equal to the area, so $(2x)(3x)/2= 108$
Solving for $x$, we find $x = 6$
Therefore, the length of the longest diagonal is $3x = \boxed{18}$.
8 games in the first round will leave 8 teams remaining
4 games in the second round will leave 4 teams remaining
2 games in the third round will leave two teams remaining
One final game is played to determine the overall winner of the tournament
Thus, there will be $8+4+2+1=\boxed{15}$ games to eliminate 15 teams.
Another way to quickly solve this problem is to note that every team except the winner must lose exactly once
Therefore, 15 teams must lose, and each game has one loser, which means that there are 15 games.
Because 3 bananas cost as much as 2 apples, 18 bananas cost as much as 12 apples
Because 6 apples cost as much as 4 oranges, 12 apples cost as much as 8 oranges
Therefore 18 bananas cost as much as $\boxed{8}$ oranges.
There are 4 divisors of 6, namely $1,2,3,6$
So the answer is $\dfrac46=\boxed{\dfrac23}$.
Prime factorizing 50, we find that $\sqrt{50}=\sqrt{2\cdot5^2}=\sqrt{2}\sqrt{5^2}=5\sqrt{2}$
Similarly, $\sqrt{18}=\sqrt{2}\sqrt{9}=3\sqrt{2}$
Five square roots of 2 plus 3 square roots of 2 is $\boxed{8\sqrt{2}}$.
Since $n$ football tickets cost $(13.5)n$ dollars, Jane can buy $n$ tickets only if $(13.5)n \le 100$
Dividing both sides of this inequality by $13.5$, we have $$n \le \frac{100}{13.5}.$$ We can rewrite $\frac{100}{13.5}$ as $\frac{200}{27}$
As a mixed number, this is $7\frac{11}{27}$, since $27$ divides into $200$ seven times with a remainder of $11$
Since Jane can only buy a whole number of tickets, the largest number of tickets she can buy is $\boxed{7}$.
We first obtain $2 \cdot b + 4$
Next, we get $2b + 4 - 4b = -2b +4$
Dividing this by two, we have $\frac{-2b +4}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} b + \frac{4}{2}$
This yields $\boxed{-b+2}$, or $\boxed{2 - b}$.
Remember that $\left(\dfrac{a}{b}\right)^n = \dfrac{a^n}{b^n}$
Applying this rule, we get $\dfrac{3^5}{4^5}=\boxed{\dfrac{243}{1024}}.$
Since $\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle, then we may use the Pythagorean Theorem.
Thus, $AB^2=BC^2+CA^2$, and so  \begin{align*}
BC^2&=AB^2-CA^2\\
&=3250^2-3000^2\\
&=250^2(13^2-12^2)\\
&=250^2(5^2)\\
&=1250^2.
\end{align*} therefore $BC=1250$ km (since $BC>0$).
Piravena travels a distance of $3250+1250+3000=\boxed{7500}$ km for her complete trip.
Once we've picked the first two digits of a $4$-digit palindrome, the other two digits are automatically chosen
Thus, we can make exactly one $4$-digit palindrome for every $2$-digit number
There are $90$ two-digit numbers ($10$ through $99$)
Accordingly, there are also $\boxed{90}$ four-digit palindromes.
Since the given segments are perpendicular, we have two consecutive right angles
Since $AB\ne DC$, we know the quadrilateral is not a rectangle
After drawing the three given sides connected by two right angles, we connect $A$ and $D$ to create a trapezoid
If we extend $\overline{DC}$ to complete the rectangle, we create a right triangle to help find the length of $\overline{AD}$
We had to extend $\overline{DC}$ by 5 units since $\overline{AB}$ is 5 units longer than $\overline{DC}$
The bottom leg of the triangle is the same length as $\overline{BC}$ since they are opposite sides of a rectangle
So we have a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12
We could use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the length of the hypotenuse, or we recognize that 5 and 12 are part of the Pythagorean triple $(5,12,13)$
So the length of the hypotenuse $\overline{AD}$ is 13 units
That makes the perimeter $9+12+4+13=\boxed{38}$ centimeters.
Alternatively, instead of extending $\overline{DC}$, we could have split the trapezoid into a $4\times12$ rectangle on top and a $(5,12,13)$ right triangle on the bottom.

Starting from the furthest inside the parentheses and working outwards, we get $1-(1+(1-(1+(1-x))))=1-(1+(1-(2-x)))$
$1-(1+(1-(2-x)))=(1-(1+(x-1))$
$(1-(1+(x-1))=\boxed{1-x}$.
To answer this question, we instead count the number of primes among the 9 two-digit positive integers whose ones digit is 1
These primes are 11, 31, 41, 61, and 71
Therefore, $\boxed{5}$ two-digit primes have a ones digit of 1.
Every odd positive integer can be expressed in the form $2x - 1$, where $x$ is a positive integer greater than or equal to $1$
When $x = 1$, the formula yields the first odd positive integer, $1$
When $x = 2$, the formula gives the second odd positive integer, $3$
Thus, the $87$th odd positive integer will be $2 \cdot 87 - 1 = \boxed{173}$.
There are 5 white balls and 11 balls total, which means there is a $\boxed{\dfrac{5}{11}}$ probability that the ball drawn out will be white.
Since the sum of the angles of a triangle is $180^\circ,$ $40^\circ+70^\circ+\angle 1=180^\circ$ and $\angle 1=70^\circ.$ This means that $\angle 2=110^\circ.$ Then $110^\circ+\angle 3+\angle
4=180^\circ,$ so $\angle 3+\angle 4=70^\circ$ and $\angle 3=\angle
4=\boxed{35^\circ}.$ [asy]

We know that the sum of the degree measures of the interior angles of a polygon can be found using the formula $180(n-2)$ where $n$ is the total number of sides of the polygon
Since the polygons in this problem are regular, each interior angle measure can be found by substituting the appropriate $n$ into the formula $\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$
From this, we know that $\angle DEA$, an interior angle of a regular pentagon, has degree measure $\frac{180(5-2)}{5}=108 ^{\circ}$
We also have that $\angle FEA$, an interior angle of a regular hexagon, has degree measure $\frac{180(6-2)}{6}=120 ^{\circ}$.
Finally, we know that the angle measures of $\angle DEA$, $\angle FEA$, and $\angle DEF$ must sum to $360 ^\circ$, so $\angle DEF$ has an angle measure of $360 - 108 - 120 = \boxed{132}$ degrees.
Find the prime factorization of 2323: $2323=23\cdot101$
The largest prime factor of 2323 is $\boxed{101}$.
After one year, there will be $60\%$ left
After two years, there will be $36\%$ left
After three years, there will be $21.6\%$ left.
As we can see, these are just increasing powers of $60\%$, the next year will not dip below $10\%$, because $60\% > 50\%$, and $21.6 > 20$
However, without calculating it exactly, you know that it will be less than $16.6\%$, and thus, it will take 5 years - meaning that in $\boxed{2009}$, the total number of wrens will drop below $10\%$ of what it originally was.
Listing her first 5 times in ascending order, we get  \[86,88,94,96,97\] Because the final median is 92 and that is between 88 and 94, the final time must also lie in this spot
Thus, we have \[86,88,x,94,96,97\] Because there are an even number of elements, the median is the mean of the center two
Thus, for the mean to be 92, $x$ must be $\boxed{90}~\text{seconds}$.
There are four total characters on the license plate
Each character has no relation to another, therefore, each character is considered an independent event
To count the total number of possibilities of a problem with independent events, we need to multiply the number of possibilities for each event.
There are a total of 26 letters in the alphabet
Of these, 6 (A, E, I, O, U, and Y) are vowels and the other 20 are consonants
There are a total of 10 digits, 0 through 9.
The number of plates then is:  \begin{align*}
\text{\# of consonants} &\times \text{\# of vowels} \times \text{\# of consonants} \times \text{\# of digits} \\
&=20 \times 6 \times 20 \times 10\\
& = \boxed{24{,}000}
\end{align*}
There are a total of 24,000 different license plate combinations.
We have $5^2-3(4) + 3^2 =25 - 3(4) + 9 = 25 - 12 + 9 = 13+9 = \boxed{22}$.
Since line $RQ$ is perpendicular to line $k$, and $l\parallel k$, line $RQ$ is perpendicular to $l$ as well
Therefore, $\angle RQS = 90^\circ$
We also have $\angle RSQ = 180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ$
The angles of $\triangle RSQ$ add to $180^\circ$, so $\angle SRQ = 180^\circ - \angle RSQ - \angle RQS = 180^\circ - 50^\circ - 90^\circ = \boxed{40^\circ}$.
Let $N$ be the digit that was written
The four-digit number $757N$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if $7 + 5 + 7 + N = 19 + N$ is divisible by $3$
We find that only $N = 2, 5, 8$ work, so there are $\boxed{3}$ possibilities for $N$.
At the 2007 Math Olympics, Canada won $17$ of $100$ possible medals, or $0.17$ of the possible medals
We convert each of the possible answers to a decimal and see which is closest to $0.17:$ \[\frac{1}{4}=0.25 \quad
\frac{1}{5}=0.2 \quad
\frac{1}{6}=0.166666..
\frac{1}{7}=0.142857..
\frac{1}{8}=0.125 \]The choice that is closest to $0.17$ is $\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}.$
To round $18.4851$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question
Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $8$ rounds up to $9$
Therefore, $18.4851$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\boxed{18.49}$.
Malcolm will take $6 \cdot 10 = 60$ minutes to finish the race, and Joshua will take $8 \cdot 10 = 80$ minutes to finish the race
Thus, Joshua will cross the finish line $80 - 60 = \boxed{20}$ minutes after Malcolm.
Plugging the known value of $w$ into the third given equation, we find that $z=100$
Plugging $z$ into the second given equation, we find that $y=110$
Plugging $y$ into the first given equation gives $x=\boxed{115}$.
Since there are 60 seconds in one minute, there are $7.8\times 60=\boxed{468}$ seconds in 7.8 minutes.
If six numbers have a mean of 83.5, then the sum of the numbers is $6 \times 83.5$, which is 501
The five known numbers have a sum of 419, so the value of $x$ must be $501 - 419 = 82$
To find the median of our six numbers, we arrange them in order from least to greatest as follows: 80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 87
The median is the average of 83 and 84, which is, coincidentally, $\boxed{83.5}$.
Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal in length
Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $8+8+8=8 \times 3=\boxed{24}.$
We use the Pythagorean Theorem to verify that triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle, or we recognize that $(6,8,10)$ is a multiple of the Pythagorean triple $(3,4,5)$
The area of a right triangle is $\frac{1}{2}bh$ where $b$ and $h$ are the lengths of the two legs, so the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2}(6)(8)=24$
If the area of the rectangle is $24$ square units and the width is $4$ units, then the length is $\frac{24}{4}=6$ units
That makes the perimeter $6+6+4+4=\boxed{20}$ units.
If one acute angle of a right triangle is $45^\circ$, then the other is $90^\circ-45^\circ =45^\circ$, so the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle
Here are two solutions:
Solution 1: Find the legs
The hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg, so each leg has length $10/\sqrt{2}$
Therefore, the area of the triangle is \[\frac12 \cdot \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10\cdot 10}{2\sqrt{2}\cdot \sqrt{2}}
= \frac{100}{4} = \boxed{25}.\]Solution 2: Find the altitude to the hypotenuse
Altitude $\overline{AD}$ to the hypotenuse of isosceles right triangle $ABC$ below divides $ABC$ into 45-45-90 triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$
Therefore, $AD=BD=CD$, so $D$ is the midpoint of the hypotenuse
This gives us $BD = CD = BC/2 = 5$, so $AD=5$ and  \[[ABC] = \frac{(AD)(BC)}{2} = \frac{(5)(10)}{2} = \boxed{25}.\][asy]

We divide the figure into a right triangle and a trapezoid, as shown
The area of the right triangle is $(15)(20)/2 = 150$, and the area of the trapezoid is $(24)(20+27)/2 = 564$
Therefore, the total area is $150+564 = \boxed{714}$ square units.
Marty can choose his paint in 4 ways and his style in 3 ways
Thus there are a total of $4\cdot 3 = \boxed{12}$ different combinations he can choose.
Since 5 and 7 share no factors other than 1, any number that is a multiple of both 5 and 7 must be a multiple of $5\cdot7=35$
Thus, we want to find how many 2-digit integers are multiples of 35
The only two-digit multiples of 35 are 35 and 70, so our answer is $\boxed{2}$ integers.
First, we label the diagram:

Triangle $ABD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $AB = BD/2 = 4$ and $AD = AB\sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3}$.
Triangle $ACD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, so $CD = AC \sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{3}\cdot \sqrt{2} = \boxed{4\sqrt{6}}$.
For the teacher to be able to split her students into $x$ groups of $y$ students each, $y$ must be a divisor of $24$
Since we want to create as few groups as possible, we need to maximize the number of students in each group
Thus, $y$ should be the greatest divisor of $24$ that is less than or equal to $10$
This means that $y=8$ and $x=3$
The teacher can create $\boxed{3}$ groups of $8$ students each.
First, observe that $AC=CD$
Therefore, triangle $ACD$ is isosceles and $\angle CAD$ is congruent to $\angle CDA$
Also, $m\angle ACD=m\angle ACB+m\angle BCD=60^\circ+90^\circ=150^\circ$
Since the three angles of triangle $ACD$ sum to 180 degrees, we have  \begin{align*}
m\angle CAD+m\angle CDA+150^\circ&=180^\circ \implies \\
2m\angle CAD&=30^\circ\implies \\
m\angle CAD&=\boxed{15} \text{ degrees}.
\end{align*}
The perimeter of the triangle is $5+6+7=18$, so the distance that each bug crawls is 9
Therefore $AB+BD=9$, and $BD=\boxed{4}$.
The positive multiples of $7$ are $7, 14, 21, 28, 35, \ldots$.
The positive multiples of $4$ are $4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, \ldots$.
We see that the smallest positive integer that is both a multiple of $7$ and a multiple of $4$ is $\boxed{28}$.
The minute hand is pointing directly at the 12 and the hour hand is pointing directly at the 11
Therefore, the angle they form is $\frac{1}{12}$ of a full revolution, which is $\frac{1}{12}\times 360^\circ=\boxed{30}$ degrees.
Her mean score was $\frac{98+97+92+85+93}{5}=\boxed{93}$.
Say the radius of the circle is $r$
Then the area of the circle is $\pi r^2,$ which we estimate to $154=\frac{22}{7}r^2$
If we multiply both sides by $\frac{7}{22}$, we get $r^2=49$ or $r=7$
The circle's circumference is $2\pi r$, which we again estimate to $\frac{44}{7}r=44$
Vanessa wants two extra inches of ribbon, so she needs to buy $44+2=\boxed{46}$ inches of ribbon.
We first recognize that $\frac{1}{4}$ is a common fraction in each of the five sums, and so the relative size of the sums depends only on the other fractions
Since $\frac{1}{3}$ is the largest of the fractions $$\frac{1}{5}, \ \frac{1}{6}, \ \frac{1}{3}, \ \frac{1}{8}, \ \text{and} \ \frac{1}{7},$$ we conclude that $\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{3}$ is the largest sum
We can simplify this sum by using a common denominator of $12:$ $$
\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{3} = \frac{3\cdot1}{3\cdot4}+\frac{4\cdot1}{4\cdot 3}
= \frac{3+4}{12}
= \frac{7}{12}.
$$ The answer is $\boxed{\frac{7}{12}}$.
There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails)
There are 2 possibilities for the dime and 2 for the quarter, so there are $2 \times 2 = 4$ successful outcomes, and the probability of this is $\dfrac{4}{16} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}}$.
From the problem, we write the equation \[\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{7}\cdot T=\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{5}\cdot90.\]Simplifying, we have  \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{14}\cdot T&=\frac{1}{15}\cdot90 \quad \implies \\
\frac{1}{14} \cdot T &=6 \quad \implies \\
T &= \boxed{84}.
\end{align*}
We know that they will meet some time $T$ after 8:00 and that $T$ must be a multiple of 4, 7, and 6
So our job is to find the smallest multiple of those three numbers
Since 4 and 7 share no factors, the first number that is a multiple of both will be $4\cdot7=28$
Next, we must find the smallest multiple of 28 and 6
We can do this in two ways: by listing multiples of 28 until we find one that is a multiple of 6 or by finding what factors of 6 that 28 is missing and multiplying by those factors.
Method 1: The multiples of 28 go 28 (not divisible by 6), 56 (not divisible by 6), 84 (which is divisible by 6!)..
So the smallest multiple of 4, 7, and 6 is 84.
Method 2: The factors of 6 are 1,2,3, and 6, so we can write 6 as $2\cdot3$
28 is divisible by 2 but not by 3, so we must multiply it by 3
We find $28\cdot3=84$ and 84 is therefore the smallest multiple of 4, 7, and 6.
Now we just need to find the time that is 84 minutes after 8:00
Since 9:00 is 60 minutes after 8:00, we just need 24 more minutes after that (since $60+24=84$)
The final time is therefore $\boxed{9:24}.$
As a common fraction, $6\frac{1}{4}=\frac{24}{4}+\frac{1}{4}=\frac{25}{4}$
Since exponents distribute across division (and the square root is an exponent of 1/2), we have $\sqrt{6\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{25}}{\sqrt{4}}=\boxed{\frac{5}{2}}$.
The 20 original trailers are now an average of 20 years old, and the $n$ new trailers are all 2 years old
There are $20+n$ trailers, and the sum of their ages is $20\cdot20+2n$
This gives us the equation  \[
\frac{400+2n}{20+n}=14,
\] which we solve like this: \begin{align*}
400+2n &= 14(20+n) \\
400+2n &= 280+14n \\
120 &= 12n
\end{align*} We find that there are $n=\boxed{10}$ new trailer homes.
Since $\angle ACT=\angle ATC$ and $\angle CAT=36^\circ$, we have $2(\angle ATC) =180^\circ-36^\circ =144^\circ$ and $\angle
ATC=\angle ACT=72^\circ$
Because $\overline{TR}$ bisects $\angle
ATC$, $\angle CTR=\frac{1}{2}(72^\circ)=36^\circ$
In triangle $CRT$, $\angle CRT=180^\circ-36^\circ-72^\circ=\boxed{72^\circ}$.
Since $\triangle ABE$ is equilateral, we know that $\angle ABE=60^\circ.$ Therefore, \begin{align*}
\angle PBC &= \angle ABC - \angle ABE \\
&= 90^\circ-60^\circ \\
&=30^\circ.
\end{align*} Since $AB=BC,$ we know that $\triangle ABC$ is a right isosceles triangle and $$\angle BAC=\angle BCA=45^\circ.$$ Then, $\angle BCP =\angle BCA=45^\circ$ and \begin{align*}
\angle BPC &= 180^\circ-\angle PBC - \angle BCP \\
&= 180^\circ - 30^\circ - 45^\circ \\
&=\boxed{105^\circ}.
\end{align*}
There are 8 figures in total
Of these, 3 are triangles
Therefore, the probability is $\boxed{\frac38}$.
If $x$ is the number of people, the first caterer charges $100+15x$ dollars, while the second charges $200+12x$ dollars
We want $$100+15x>200+12x.$$ Subtracting $100$ from both sides gives $$15x > 100+12x,$$ then subtracting $12x$ from both sides gives $$3x>100.$$ Finally, dividing both sides by $3$ gives $x=\frac{100}{3}=33\frac{1}{3}$, so the smallest number of people is $\boxed{34}$.
23 is prime, so its only positive divisors are 1 and 23
Thus the sum of the positive divisors of 23 is $1+23=\boxed{24}$.
Recall that ``four-thirds of" is the same as ``four-thirds times"
This means that four-thirds of $\frac{9}{2}$ is the same as $\frac{4}{3}\cdot \frac{9}{2}=\frac{4\cdot 9}{3\cdot 2}$
By the commutative property of multiplication we know that $\frac{4\cdot 9}{3\cdot 2}=\frac{9\cdot 4}{3\cdot 2}=\frac{9}{3}\cdot \frac{4}{2}=3\cdot 2=\boxed{6}.$
A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.
A number is divisible by 2 if and only if its last digit is even
A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3
The sum of the digits in each of Luna's numbers is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15$, which is divisible by 3, so each of Luna's numbers is divisible by 3.
The smallest number in Luna's list is 12345, which is not divisible by 2
The next smallest number in Luna's list is 12354, which is divisible by 2, so the answer is $\boxed{12354}$.
There are 3 yellow faces and 8 faces total, so the probability of rolling a yellow face is $\boxed{\dfrac38}$.
Let $x = 4.\overline{054}$
We then have $1000x = 4054.\overline{054}$, so $$ 1000x - x = 4054.\overline{054} - 4.\overline{054} = 4050 \ \ \Rightarrow \ \ x = \frac{4050}{999} = \boxed{\frac{150}{37}}
Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$
We are trying to find the area of the rectangle, or $l \cdot w$, so we need to first find both $l$ and $w$
We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information:
\begin{align*}
l &= 3w \\
2l + 2w &= 160 \\
\end{align*}We will first solve for $w$ by eliminating $l$ from the equations above
Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $l$, we get $2(3w)+2w=160$ or $w=20$
Plugging this value into the first equation gives $l=3(20)=60$
Thus, the area of the rectangle is $l \cdot w = 60 \cdot 20 = \boxed{1200}$ square centimeters.
We count the tallies to see that $5$ students scored in the $60\%-69\%$ range
Now we count tallies to find that there are $4+8+6+5+2=25$ students in the class
The percent of the class that received a score in the $60\%-69\%$ range is $\frac{5}{25}\times\frac44=\frac{20}{100}=\boxed{20\%}$.
First, multiply the fractions to get $$\frac{18}{17}\cdot\frac{13}{24}\cdot\frac{68}{39}=\frac{18\cdot 13 \cdot 68}{17 \cdot 24 \cdot 39}.$$Before we start multiplying these numbers out, let's see if the numerator and denominator share any common factors
18 and 24 have a common factor of 6, 13 and 39 have a common factor of 13, while 17 and 68 have a common factor of 17
$$\frac{18}{17}\cdot\frac{13}{24}\cdot\frac{68}{39}=\frac{\cancel{6}\cdot3}{\cancel{17}\cdot1}\cdot\frac{\cancel{13}\cdot1}{\cancel{6}\cdot4}\cdot\frac{\cancel{17}\cdot4}{\cancel{13}\cdot3}.$$After this first round of simplification, we notice that we can cancel 4 and 3 from the resulting fraction, giving $$\frac{\cancel{3}}{\cancel{1}}\cdot\frac{\cancel{1}}{\cancel{4}}\cdot\frac{\cancel{4}}{\cancel{3}}=\boxed{1}.$$
Since 7 Namibian dollars ($\text{N}\$$) is equal to 1 US dollar (USD), 105 Namibian dollars is equal to $\text{N}\$105\left(\dfrac{1\;\text{USD}}{\text{N}\$7}\right) = 15\;\text{USD}$
Since 1 US dollar (USD) is equal to 6 Chinese yuan (CNY), 105 Namibian dollars is equal to 15 US dollars is equal to $15\;\text{USD}\left(\dfrac{6\;\text{CNY}}{1\;\text{USD}}\right) = \boxed{90}\;\text{yuan}$.
Let $S$ be the sum of the ages of the females
Then $30 = \frac{S}{10}$ (since the average is the sum divided by the number of elements), so $S = (30)(10)$
Similarly, the sum of the males' ages is $(35)(15)$
So the sum of all the ages is $(30)(10)+(35)(15)$
There are a total of 25 people, so the average is $$
\frac{(30)(10)+(35)(15)}{25} = \boxed{33}.
Each of the six women shakes hands with four other women
Multiplying six by four will count each handshake twice, however, so we must divide by 2 to correct for this

Since $2a + 1 = 1,$ we find that $2a = 0,$ so $a = 0.$ Therefore, $b - a = b - 0 = b = \boxed{1}.$
Let the rectangle's width be $w$, then its length is $2w$
So its perimeter is $2(w + 2w) = 6w = 54$
Thus $w = 9$, and the rectangle's area is $9(2\cdot 9) = \boxed{162}$ square meters.
Manually dividing, we see that $4 \div 7 = 0.57142857\ldots$
Therefore, the decimal representation of $\frac 47$ repeats after every $6$ digits
Since $125 = 20 \times 6 + 5$, the $125$th digit beyond the decimal point is the same as the $5$th digit beyond the decimal point, which is $\boxed{2}$.
A diagonal of a square divides the square into two 45-45-90 right triangles, so the side length of the square is $10\sqrt{2}/\sqrt{2}=10$ centimeters and its area is $10^2=\boxed{100}$ square centimeters
The sum of the angles around any point is $360^\circ$
Therefore, $5x^\circ+4x^\circ+x^\circ+2x^\circ=360^\circ$ or $12x = 360$ or $x=\boxed{30}$.
There are 12 vertices in the icosahedron, so from each vertex there are potentially 11 other vertices to which we could extend a diagonal
However, 5 of these 11 points are connected to the original point by an edge, so they are not connected by interior diagonals
So each vertex is connected to 6 other points by interior diagonals
This gives a preliminary count of $12 \times 6 = 72$ interior diagonals
However, we have counted each diagonal twice (once for each of its endpoints), so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcounting, and the answer is $\dfrac{12 \times 6}{2} = \boxed{36}$ diagonals.
To round to the nearest hundredth, we look at the digit in the thousandth place
65.141 (A), 65.1401 (D), and 65.14444 (E) all round down to 65.14 since the digit in the thousandth place is less than 5
65.138 (B) rounds up to 65.14 since the digit in the thousandth place, 8, is greater than 5
65.1339999 (C) rounds to 65.13, not 65.14
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{C}$.
Since $15=5 \times 3$, the total value of his collection will be worth $3$ times the amount that the $5$ coins are worth by themselves
Thus the total value of his coin collection is $12 \times 3=\boxed{36}$ dollars.
We are asked to solve \[
\frac{x}{3}=50+\frac{x}{4}.
\] Subtract $x/4$ from both sides to find $x/12=50$, which implies $x=\boxed{600}$.
$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{2})^1}+\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{2})^2}+\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{2})^3}}=\frac{1}{\frac{2}{1}+\frac{4}{1}+\frac{8}{1}}=\boxed{\frac{1}{14}}$.
Crystal has $4$ ways to select the entree
Once she has done that, there are $2$ drinks that can go with each entree for a total of $4\cdot2=8$ ways to select the entree and the drink
For each of the $8$ ways of selecting the first two items, there are $2$ ways to select the dessert for a final answer of $8\cdot2=\boxed{16}$ ways to choose the whole meal.
Reading the dark bars on the chart, we find that the high temperatures for the five days are 49, 62, 58, 57, and 46 degrees
Their average is $(49+62+58+57+46)/5=\boxed{54.4}$ degrees Fahrenheit.
Consider the triangle with angle 4; label the other two angles angle 5 and angle 6
By triangle angle-sum, $m\angle1+m\angle2+m\angle3+m\angle5+m\angle6=180^{\circ}$, or \[
m\angle5+m\angle6=180^{\circ}-76^{\circ}-27^{\circ}-17^{\circ}=60^{\circ}
\] By triangle angle-sum on the small triangle, $m\angle4+m\angle5+m\angle6=180^{\circ}$, so $60^{\circ}+m\angle4=180^{\circ}$ or $m\angle4=\boxed{120^{\circ}}$.
Let $a=0.\overline{43}$
Then $100a=43.\overline{43}$
Subtracting the left-hand sides $100a$ and $a$, and subtracting the right-hand sides $43.\overline{43}$ and $0.\overline{43}$ yields \begin{align*} 100a- a &= 43.\overline{43}- 0.\overline{43}\\ \Rightarrow 99a &= 43\\ \Rightarrow a &= \boxed{\frac{43}{99}}
\end{align*}
The figure has $8$ sides, each of equal length
Since the length of each side is $2,$ then the perimeter of the figure is $8\times 2 =\boxed{16}.$
If half a liter is 1.05 pints, then a whole liter is $2\cdot1.05=\boxed{2.1}$ pints.
Recall that $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n=\frac{a^n}{b^n}$
Therefore  $$7\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^3=7\left(\frac{1^3}{5^3}\right)=7\left(\frac{1}{125}\right)=\boxed{\frac{7}{125}}.$$
If the greatest common divisor with 21 is 7, then the other number must be a multiple of 7
The only multiple of 7 between 50 and 60 is $\boxed{56}$, so that is our answer.
We have 6 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to the 6 faces of the cube
4 of those 6 outcomes are successful ones (meaning a blue face is facing up)
Therefore the probability is $\frac{4}{6} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
If the zookeeper starts with the male giraffe, there are 4 females which he can feed next
Once one is selected, there are 3 males he can feed next, then 3 females, 2 males, 2 females, 1 male, and 1 female.
The total number of possibilities is $4\times3\times3\times2\times2 = \boxed{144}$ ways.
Rewriting the fractions to have a common denominator of $60,$ we have \begin{align*}
\text{Kickball: }&\frac{22}{60} \\
\text{Picnic: }&\frac{21}{60} \\
\text{Softball: }&\frac{25}{60}
\end{align*} So the order is $\boxed{\text{Softball, Kickball, Picnic}}.$
The area of the black region is the difference between the area of the larger square and the area of the smaller square which has been removed: $7^2-3^2=\boxed{40}$ square units.
A triangle can't have two right angles, so a right triangle with two congruent angles must have congruent acute angles
That is, $\triangle PQR$ must be an isosceles right triangle with acute angles at $Q$ and $R$
Therefore, $PQ=PR=6\sqrt{2}$,  and $[QRP]=(QP)(RP)/2 = (6\sqrt{2})(6\sqrt{2})/2 = (6\cdot 6\cdot\sqrt{2}\cdot \sqrt{2})/2 =\boxed{36}$.

30 of the students own cats, and there are 300 students total, which makes for a fraction: $\frac{30}{300} = \frac{1}{10} = \boxed{10\%}$.
The altitude of an isosceles triangle splits the base into two congruent segments, so $BD = DC = 7$
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $\triangle ABD$, or remembering the 7-24-25 Pythagorean triple, gives $AD = 24$, so the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $(24)(14)/2 = \boxed{168}$.
There are ten total marbles, and five are either red or blue
Thus, the probability is $\frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2},$ or $\boxed{0.5}.$
Let us call $x$ the number of sides in the polygon
The sum of all the angles of the polygon with $x$ sides is $180(x-2)$, but with the information given, it can also be expressed as $160 + 112(x-1)$
Therefore, setting these two equations equal: \begin{align*}
180(x-2) &= 160 + 112(x-1)\\
180x - 360 &= 160 + 112x - 112\\
68x &= 408\\
x &= 6\\
\end{align*} Thus, it has $\boxed{6}$ sides, and is a hexagon.
Since $\angle ABC + \angle BAC + \angle BCA=180^\circ$ and $\angle ABC=80^\circ$ and $\angle BAC=60^\circ$, then $\angle BCA=40^\circ$.

Since $\angle DCE = \angle BCA = 40^\circ$, and looking at triangle $CDE$, we see that $\angle DCE + \angle CED = 90^\circ$ then $40^\circ + y^\circ = 90^\circ$ or $y=\boxed{50}$.
There are $360^\circ$(degrees) in a circle and twelve spaces on a clock
This means that each space measures $30^\circ$
At 10 o'clock the hands point to 10 and 12

Multiplying both sides of the inequality by $13$, we have $\frac{91}{9}>x$
The largest integer smaller than $\frac{91}{9}$ is $\boxed{10}$.
A number with 15, 20 and 25 as factors must be divisible by their least common multiple (LCM)
Because $15 = 3
\times 5$, $20 = 2^2 \times 5$, and $25 = 5^2$, the LCM of 15, 20 and 25 is $2^2 \times 3 \times 5^2 = 300$
There are $\boxed{3}$ multiples of 300 between 1000 and 2000: 1200, 1500 and 1800.
Each leg of the right triangle is a side of one of the squares
Therefore, the legs of the right triangle have lengths $\sqrt{25}=5$ and $\sqrt{144}=12$, so the area of the triangle is $\frac12(5)(12) = \boxed{30}$.
Note that $11 \times 9 = 99 < 100 < 110 = 11 \times 10$ and $11 \times 90 = 990 < 1000 < 1001 = 11 \times 91$
So the list of 3-digit numbers divisible by 11 is $110,121,\ldots,990$, and when we divide this list by 11, we get the list $10,11,12,\ldots,89,90$, which has $90 - 10 + 1 = \boxed{81}$ numbers.
Prime factorize $56=8\cdot7=2^3\cdot 7$
Fifty-six has $\boxed{2}$ prime factors: 2 and 7.
There are seven choices for the first initial, seven for the second, and seven for the third
Thus, there are $7^3 = \boxed{343}$ combinations possible.
$32=2^5$ and $48=2^4\cdot3$
The only prime number these two have in common is 2
If a number contains a factor of 2 greater than $2^4$, then it cannot be a factor of 48
However, $2^4$ is a factor of both numbers
Thus, the greatest common factor of 32 and 48 is $2^4=\boxed{16}$.
We have to consider 2 cases:
When the hundreds digit is 3, we want the sum of the tens and unit digit equal to 13
We have $4+9=5+8=6+7=13,$ which yield a total of 6 choices (two for each pair that adds to 13).
When the hundreds digit is 4, we want the sum of the tens and unit digit equal to 12
We have $3+9=4+8=5+7=6+6=12.$ The first three pairs give us 2 solutions, but the last only gives 1, so we have a total of 7 choices.
Therefore there are total of $6+7= \boxed{13}$ integers.
Say the hypotenuse has length $h$ inches
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $h^2=20^2+21^2=400+441=841$, so $h=\sqrt{841}=29$
The length is thus $\boxed{29}$ inches.
The largest enrollment is 1900 and the smallest enrollment is 1250
The positive difference is $1900-1250=\boxed{650}$ students.
The least common multiple of $8=2^3$ and $14=2\cdot 7$ is $2^3\cdot 7 = 56$
The least common multiple of 7 and 12 is $7\cdot 12=84$
The greatest common factor of $56=2^3\cdot 7$ and $84=2^2\cdot 3 \cdot 7$ is $2^2\cdot 7=\boxed{28}$.
Dividing 10 by 3 gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 1
Therefore, $3 \cdot 3$ is the largest one-digit multiple of 3, and $3 \cdot 4$ is the least positive two-digit multiple of 3
This calculation shows that $a=12$.
Dividing 100 by 4 gives a quotient of 25 and no remainder
Therefore, $4 \cdot 25$ is the least positive three-digit multiple of 4, and $b=100$.
Combining these results gives $a+b = 12+100 = \boxed{112}$.
Average speed is defined as total distance traveled divided by time traveled
In total, Stan drove 660 miles and it took him 12 hours
His average speed was $660/12=600/12+60/12=50+5=\boxed{55}$ miles per hour.
Let the measure of $\angle A$ be $x$, so we have $\angle B = x$ and $\angle C=x$, too
Since $\angle A$ is $40^\circ$ less than $\angle D$, we have $\angle D = x + 40^\circ$, so $\angle E = x+40^\circ$
The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we have \[x + x + x + (x+40^\circ) + (x+40^\circ) = 540^\circ.\] Simplifying the left side gives $5x + 80^\circ = 540^\circ$, so $5x = 460^\circ$ and $x = 92^\circ$
Therefore, $\angle D = \angle A + 40^\circ = \boxed{132^\circ}$.
Picturing the situation, we have a trapezoid with the two poles as bases
We can split this trapezoid into a rectangle at the bottom and a right triangle at the top, where the hypotenuse of the right triangle is the wire stretched from the top of one pole to the top of the other pole.

The horizontal leg of the right triangle is 12 feet, the horizontal distance from one pole to the other
The vertical leg of the triangle is $15-6=9$ feet, the height difference of the poles
By the Pythagorean Theorem $a^2+b^2=c^2$, we can solve for the length of the hypotenuse
We get $c=\sqrt{144+81}=\sqrt{225}=15$
So the wire is $\boxed{15}$ feet long.
Alternatively, instead of using the Pythagorean Theorem, we notice that 9-12-$c$ has the same ratios as the 3-4-5 right triangle
So $c=3\cdot5=\boxed{15}$.
We see that the denominators have a common multiple of 330, so the expression becomes $\frac{1}{330} + \frac{11 \cdot 19}{11 \cdot 30} = \frac{1}{330} + \frac{209}{330} = \frac{1+209}{330} = \frac{210}{330}$
Factoring the numerator and denominator, we see that the fraction is $\frac{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7}{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 11}$
Thus, the numerator and denominator share common factors of 2, 3, and 5
Thus, cancelling, we find the answer is $\frac{\cancel{2} \cdot \cancel{3} \cdot \cancel{5} \cdot 7}{\cancel{2} \cdot \cancel{3} \cdot \cancel{5} \cdot 11} = \boxed{\frac{7}{11}}.$
The denominators 6 and 10 have a common multiple of 30
We write $\frac{9}{10}\cdot\frac{3}{3}=\frac{27}{30}$ and $\frac{5}{6}\cdot\frac{5}{5}=\frac{25}{30},$ so we can add \[
\frac{27}{30}+\frac{25}{30} = \frac{52}{30}.
\]The numerator ($52$) and denominator ($30$) have a common factor of $2$, so we can simplify
\frac{52}{30} = \frac{26 \cdot \cancel{2}}{15 \cdot \cancel{2}} = \boxed{\frac{26}{15}}.
Since $AB$ is a line segment, $\angle ACD+\angle DCE+\angle ECB=180^\circ$ or $90^\circ + x^\circ + 52^\circ =180^\circ$ or $x^\circ=180^\circ-90^\circ-52^\circ$ or $x=\boxed{38}$.

Since the measures are in the ratio $7:2$, the measures are $7x$ and $2x$ for some value of $x$
Since the angles are supplementary, we have $7x + 2x = 180^\circ$, so $9x = 180^\circ$ and $x= 20^\circ$
Therefore, the angle measures are $7x=140^\circ$ and $2x=40^\circ$, so their positive difference is $140^\circ - 40^\circ = \boxed{100^\circ}$.
We know that the area of a triangle is equal to $\frac{1}{2}bh$ where $b$ is the length of the base and $h$ is the altitude of the triangle
Since we know that the area of the triangles is $600$ sq
feet and the base is $30$ feet, we have that $600 = \frac{1}{2} (30)h$, so $600=15h$
Dividing both sides of the equation by $15$, we have that $h=40$
The altitude of the triangle is $\boxed{40}$ feet.
The sum of the three angles in any triangle is always $180^\circ.$ In $\triangle PQR,$ the sum of $\angle P$ and $\angle Q$ is $60^\circ,$ and thus $\angle R$ must measure $$180^\circ - 60^\circ = \boxed{120^\circ}.$$
Since $73$ is between $64=8^{2}$ and $81=9^{2}$, we know that $\sqrt{73}$ is between $8$ and $9.$ Our answer is $8\cdot9=\boxed{72}.$
We know that any number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$, or $a^0 = 1$ for any $a$

Since $\overline{CD}\parallel l$, we have $\angle ACD = 180^\circ - \angle A = 60^\circ$
Since $\overline{CD}\parallel m$, we have $\angle BCD = 180^\circ - \angle B = 30^\circ$
Therefore, $\angle ACB = \angle ACD + \angle DCB = 60^\circ + 30^\circ = \boxed{90^\circ}$.
There are two ways to get from $A$ to $B$, and there are two ways to get from $B$ to $C$: this gives four paths
Alternately, we could bypass $B$ entirely and move straight from $A$ to $C$: there is one such path
Thus, there are $\boxed{5}$ different paths.
Writing the problem in cents, and letting the number of each coin be $x$, we have $5x + 10x + 25x = 1320$, or $40x = 1320$

We perform the operation in parentheses first: \[88 \div (4 \div 2) = 88 \div 2 = \boxed{44}.\]

We want to find $\angle XZY$
Since $\angle XYZ$ is an angle of a square, $\angle XYZ=90^\circ$
Also, $\angle YXZ$ is part of an angle of a square
By symmetry, the large angle at $X$ can be dissected into a sum of three angles, \[90^\circ = \angle YXZ +60^\circ+\angle YXZ=2\angle YXZ+60^\circ.\] Therefore $\angle YXZ=15^\circ$
The mystery angle is the third angle of this triangle, so \[\angle XZY=180^\circ-90^\circ-15^\circ=\boxed{75^\circ}.\]
The first multiple of $3$ that is greater than $62$ is $63$, and the last multiple of $3$ that is less than $215$ is $213$
We're only interested in numbers that are divisible by $3$, and the list of such numbers is $$63, 66, 69, \ldots, 210, 213.$$ To count the number of numbers in this list, first divide each by $3$
Our list then becomes $$21, 22, 23, \ldots, 70, 71.$$ Finally, subtract $20$ from each number, and the list becomes $$1, 2, 3, \ldots, 50, 51.$$ Thus, there are $\boxed{51}$ multiples of $3$ between $62$ and $215$.
In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9
Since $2+4=6$, the only digit that will make the sum of the digits of the three-digit number divisible by 9 is $3$
Therefore, the three-digit number is $\boxed{432}$.
The prime factorization of $60$ is $60 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$
This means that the odd positive divisors of $60$ are the divisors of $3 \cdot 5 = 15$ which are $1$, $3$, $5$, and $15$
The sum of these numbers is $1+3+5+15=\boxed{24}$.
The ratio of white paint to green paint is $4:2$ which simplifies to $2:1$, so Giselle should use twice as much white paint as green paint
Since she uses $12$ quarts of white paint, she should use $12 \div 2 = \boxed{6}$ quarts of green paint.
Breaking the outer figure into two rectangles, we find that the total area of the shaded region plus unshaded region is $10\cdot 8 + 2\cdot 4 = 88$
Thus the area of the non-shaded region is $88-78 = 10$ square inches
This means that its remaining side length is 5 inches, and its perimeter is $2(2 + 5) = \boxed{14}$ inches.
If the co-president positions are unique, there are 15 choices for the first president and 14 choices for the second president
However, since the positions are identical, we must divide by $2$, since $15\cdot 14$ counts each possible pair of co-presidents twice, once for each order in which they are selected
This gives us $\dfrac{15 \times 14}{2} = \boxed{105}$ ways to choose the co-presidents.
The number of cookies eaten by Andy depends on the number eaten by his sister: if Andy eats more, then Alexa eats fewer, and the total always adds up to 24
We want to maximize the number eaten by the brother, so we want to minimize the number eaten by the sister
The smallest positive multiple of the number eaten by Andy is one times that number, which is the number itself
Alexa must eat the same number as Andy, so each sibling eats half the cookies.
The brother could have eaten a maximum of $24\div 2 = \boxed{12}$ cookies.
The first two distinct primes greater than 20 are 23 and 29

Calculating from the inside out, $$\sqrt{36 \times \sqrt{16}} = \sqrt{36 \times 4} = \sqrt{144} = \boxed{12}.$$
We have a right triangle where the ratio of one leg to the hypotenuse is $15:17$
Since 8, 15, 17 is a Pythagorean triple, the ratio of the other leg to the hypotenuse must be $8:17$
If the length of this leg is $x$, this means that $x/8.5 = 8/17$
It follows that $x = \boxed{4}$ meters.
We have  \[2.43-1.2 = 2.43 - (1+0.2) = 2.43 -1 -0.2 = 1.43 - 0.2 = \boxed{1.23}.\]
The average cost per pencil is equal to the total cost divided by the number of pencils
The total cost is $19.90+6.95=26.85$ dollars, or 2685 cents, and there are 200 pencils
Thus, the average cost is $\frac{2685}{200}\approx\boxed{13}$ cents.
The angles of a triangle sum to $180^\circ$, so we have $x + 2x + 30^\circ = 180^\circ$
Simplifying gives $3x +30^\circ = 180^\circ$, so $3x =150^\circ$ and $x = \boxed{50^\circ}$.
Since 91 is not divisible by the first three prime numbers, we try dividing $91\div 7$
We find a quotient of 13, so $91=7\times 13$ and the sum of these prime factors is $7+13=\boxed{20}$.
We can count the total number of triangles that can be chosen directly, by listing them: $AEC$, $AEB$, $BED$, $BEC$, and $BDC$
Of these, the triangles with a part shaded are $AEC$, $BEC$, and $BDC$
So there is $\boxed{\frac{3}{5}}$ probability of selecting a triangle with all or part of its interior shaded.
We want to find the fraction of people that chose ``Pop"
To this end, we find the fraction of the circle that represents ``Pop", $\frac{251}{360}$, and multiply by the total number of people surveyed: $472 \cdot \frac{251}{360} \approx 329.089$
Rounding to a whole number gives a possible answer of $329$ people.
This method doesn't prove that the answer is unique, but we can check that $328$ people would take up only $\frac{328}{472}\cdot 360 \approx 250.169$ degrees of the pie chart, while $330$ people would take up $\frac{330}{472}\cdot 360 \approx 251.695$ degrees
So, $\boxed{329}$ people are the only number whose share of the pie rounds to the nearest degree as $251^\circ$.
We take the four smallest primes: 2, 3, 5, 7
Their least common multiple is simply their product, so the least whole number divisible by four different primes is  $2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7=\boxed{210}$.
There are 11 small triangles, 4 triangles which consist of four small triangles, and 1 triangle which consists of 9 small triangles
In total, there are $\boxed{16}$ triangles.
Since $6 = 2 \cdot 3$ and $3$ is relatively prime with $8$ while $2$ divides into both $6$ and $8$, it follows that $\text{gcd}(6,8) = 2$
The multiples of $8$ are $8, 16, 24, 32\ldots$ and the multiples of $6$ are $6, 12, 18, 24, 30, \ldots$, so $\text{lcm}(6,8) = 24$
Thus, the desired product is $2 \times 24 = \boxed{48}.$
Notice that this product is equal to the product of the original numbers, $6\times 8$
Is there a reason for that?
In a triangle, the degrees of the three angles add up to $180$
We set the degree measure for $\angle C$ to be $x$
Therefore, the angle measure for $\angle B$ is $3x+22$
We add all of the degrees together to $180$
Then we have: \begin{align*}
86+3x+22+x &= 180 \\
108+4x &= 180 \\
4x &= 72 \\
x &= 18.
\end{align*} Therefore, we have that the degree measure of $\angle C$ is $\boxed{18 \text{ degrees}}$.
There are 10 two-digit numbers with a 7 as their 10's digit, and 9 two-digit numbers with 7 as their units digit
Because 77 satisfies both of these properties, the answer is $10+9-1 = \boxed{18}$.
In total, the traveler went 12 miles north and 5 miles west
This forms a 5-12-13 Pythagorean triple, so the traveler is $\boxed{13}$ miles away from the starting point.
Since he traveled 160 miles in 5 hours, his speed measured in miles per hour is $\frac{160}{5} = \boxed{32}$.
There is 1 choice for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, 5 for Wednesday, 4 for Thursday, and 1 for Friday, for a total of $1\cdot 2\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 1 = \boxed{40}$ different combinations of people who are willing to do it.
Since we want a large 5-digit integer, we want the digits to the left to be as large as possible
We prime factorize the product to get $7 \cdot 5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 2^4$
The largest single-digit number is $9$, which can be found by $3^2$
This leaves us $7 \cdot 5 \cdot 2^4$
We can get the next largest number, $8$, by using $2^3$
This leaves $7 \cdot 5\cdot 2$
We can't multiply any of those numbers together to get a single-digit number, so we have that the remaining three digits are $7,5$, and $2$
Ordering the digits from largest to smallest, we get $\boxed{98752}$.
If the side length of each successive equilateral triangle is $150\%$ of the previous triangle, then we can multiply the previous side length by 1.5
We will need to do this three times to get to the fourth triangle, so its side length will be $$1.5^3 = 1.5 \times 1.5 \times 1.5 = 3.375$$ times the  original side length
This is the same as $337.5\%$ of the original side length, which represents a $337.5 - 100 = 237.5\%$ increase over the original side length
The perimeter is also a length, so it will be affected in the same way
The percent increase in the perimeter is $\boxed{237.5\%}$.
First, we take $5.4 \div 3 = 1.8$
Then, we convert 1.8 to a fraction
Since $1.8 = \frac{18}{10}$, we can simplify this fraction to yield $\boxed{\frac{9}{5}}$.
Dividing each member of the list by 2, we get $2,3,4,\ldots,64,65$, and then subtracting 1, we get $1,2,3,\ldots,63,64$, so there are $\boxed{64}$ numbers.
The remaining side is minimized if it is a leg of the triangle rather than the hypotenuse
Then its length is $\sqrt{8^2 - 6^2} = 2\sqrt 7\approx \boxed{5.29}$ cm.
Let each side of the square have length $x$
Then $AM=MB=BN=x/2$
So the area of the triangle is $(x/2)(x/2)/2=x^2/8$
The area of the square is $x\cdot x= x^2$
The ratio of the two areas is $(x^2/8)/x^2=\boxed{\frac{1}{8}}$.
There are 6 total equally likely outcomes, and 2 successful outcomes, so the probability is $\frac{2}{6} = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
Let $s$ equal the side length of square $S.$ Then the area of $S$ is $s^2.$ The longer side of rectangle $R$ will have length $1.1s$ and the shorter side will have length $.9s.$ Thus, the area of rectangle $R$ is: $$1.1s\cdot.9s=.99s^2.$$ The ratio of the area of rectangle $R$ to the area of square $S$ will be: $$\frac{.99s^2}{s^2}=\boxed{\frac{99}{100}}.$$
Squaring the first few positive integers, we find that the first few perfect squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, and 64
First we strike off the ones that are not even, leaving us with 4, 16, 36, and 64
Four is not divisible by 3, and 16 is not divisible by 3 since the sum of its digits, $1+6=7$, is not divisible by 3
However, the sum of the digits of 36 is $3+6=9$, so 36 is divisible by 3
Thus $\boxed{36}$ is the least perfect square divisible by both 2 and 3.
If there are 4 vegetarian dishes on the menu and 3 of them contain gluten, then $4-3=1$ vegetarian dish does not contain gluten
This means that $\frac{1}{4}$ of the vegetarian dishes are gluten-free
We know that $\frac{1}{5}$ of all the dishes on the menu are vegetarian, so $\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{1}{5}=\boxed{\frac{1}{20}}$ of the menu items are both vegetarian and gluten-free.
Palindromes are numbers whose digits read from left to right and from right to left result in the same number
All two-digit palindromes (11, 22,...99) can be factored into 11 and a number between 1 and 9
The only factor that all of them share is $\boxed{11}$, so that is our answer.
Listing out the first few positive multiples of $4$ and of $14$ shows that $\boxed{28}$ is the smallest multiple of both $4$ and $14.$ Notice that the least common multiple is not simply $4\cdot14=56.$
$8=1\cdot8=2\cdot4$
Therefore, the only two-digit whole numbers the product of whose digits is $8$ are $18$, $81$, $24$, and $42$
The greatest is $\boxed{81}$.
Let $x = 1.\overline{27}$
We then have $100x =127.\overline{27}$, so $$ 100x - x = 127.\overline{27} - 1.\overline{27} = 126 \ \ \Rightarrow \ \ x = \frac{126}{99} = \boxed{\dfrac{14}{11}}
Combining like terms, $w + 2 - 3w - 4 + 5w + 6 - 7w - 8 = (w - 3w + 5w - 7w) + (2 - 4 + 6 - 8) = \boxed{-4w - 4}$.
We can perform this addition concisely in columns, though we have to "carry" a digit to the leftmost column because $3+8=11,$ which is greater than $10:$ \[
\begin{array}{@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& 1 & & \\
& 3 & \\
& 8 & 8
\\ \cline{1-4}
& 1 & 8 \\
\end{array}
\] The answer is $\boxed{8.18}$.
Call the length of the radius $r$ units
$r^2\pi=\pi$, so $r=1$
The diameter is twice the radius, or $\boxed{2}$ units.
There are 10 choices for the top number
That leaves 9 for the second number
Once those are chosen, there are 8 possibilities for the third number, then 7 for the fourth and 6 for the fifth
That gives a total of  \[10\times9\times 8 \times 7\times 6 = \boxed{30240}\] possible first columns.
If we define the variable $s$ to be $0.\overline{123}$, then multiplying both sides of $s=0.\overline{123}$ by 1000 gives us $$1000s = 123.\overline{123}.$$ Subtracting $s$ from $1000s$ and $0.\overline{123}$ from $123.\overline{123}$ tells us that $$999s = 123$$ and thus $$s=\frac{123}{999}.$$ We can now calculate that our final answer is   $$\frac{123}{999} \cdot 9 = \frac{123}{999 \div 9} = \frac{123 \div 3}{111 \div 3}=\boxed{\frac{41}{37}}.$$
Often, the tricky part of casework problems is deciding what the cases should be
For this problem, it makes sense to use as our cases the number of letters in each word.
$\bullet$  Case 1: (1-letter words) There are $5$ 1-letter words (each of the $5$ letters is itself a 1-letter word).
$\bullet$  Case 2: (2-letter words) To form a 2-letter word, we have $5$ choices for our first letter, and $5$ choices for our second letter
Thus there are $5 \times 5 = 25$ 2-letter words possible.
$\bullet$  Case 3: (3-letter words) To form a 3-letter word, we have $5$ choices for our first letter, $5$ choices for our second letter, and $5$ choices for our third letter
Thus there are $5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125$ 3-letter words possible.
So to get the total number of words in the language, we add the number of words from each of our cases
(We need to make sure that the cases are exclusive, meaning they don't overlap
But that's clear in this solution, since, for example, a word can't be both a 2-letter word and a 3-letter word at the same time.)
Therefore there are $5 + 25 + 125 = \boxed{155}$ words possible on Mumble
(I guess the Mumblians don't have a lot to say.)
To find the greatest common factor of 252 and 96, we prime factorize the two numbers as $2^2\cdot3^2\cdot 7$ and $2^5\cdot 3$
The exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of a common factor of 252 and 96 can be no greater than 2, and the exponent of 3 can be no greater than 1
Therefore, the greatest common factor of 252 and 96 is $2^2\cdot 3=\boxed{12}$.
The angles around a point sum to $360^\circ$, so $x^\circ + x^\circ + 160^\circ = 360^\circ$
Simplifying gives $2x^\circ + 160^\circ = 360^\circ$, so $2x^\circ = 200^\circ$ and $x=\boxed{100}$.
If the mean of the $12$ scores is $82$, then the sum of the $12$ scores is $82\times12$
After the two scores are removed, the sum of the $10$ remaining scores is $84\times10=840$
The sum of the two removed scores is $$82\times12-840=4(41\times6-210)=4(246-210)=4(36)=144.$$ Since one of the removed scores is $98$, the other removed score is $144-98=\boxed{46}$.
Eliminating multiple occurrences of the same letter, the word `PROBABILITY' uses $9$ different letters of the alphabet, A, B, I, L, O, P, R, T, and Y
Since there are $26$ letters in the alphabet, the probability that Jeff picks one of the $9$ different letters in `PROBABILITY' is $\boxed{\frac{9}{26}}.$
The maximum number of points at which a line can intersect 1 circle is 2 distinct points
Thus, for 3 circles, the maximum should be $3 \times 2 = 6$ points at most
If you're going for speed, you should probably guess 6 points at this point with a reasonable degree of certainty
If you have time and want to be certain, you should only check for the existence of a line that intersects the three circles at $\boxed{6}$ distinct points, because it is impossible that a line could intersect the circles at more than 6 points
(There are, in fact, many lines that satisfy the conditions.)
Distributing on both sides gives $6x-3a = 6x+24$
Subtracting $6x$ from both sides gives $-3a=24$
If $a=\boxed{-8}$, then this equation is always true, and the original equation is true for all $x$ (and so has infinitely many solutions)
Otherwise, the equation is never true, so the original equation has no solutions.
12 states joined from 1780 to 1789
Therefore, of his first 22 quarters, 12 of them are from this time period, making for $\frac{12}{22} = \boxed{\frac{6}{11}}$ of his coins being from this time period.
We begin by counting how many prime and composite numbers there are between 2 and 25 inclusive
The prime numbers in that range are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, so there are 9 prime numbers
This means that there are $24 - 9 = 15$ composite numbers.
For each of the 9 prime numbers, I take one step forward, and for each of the 15 composite numbers, I take two steps back, for a net total of $9(1)+(15)(-2)=-21$ steps forward, i.e., 21 steps backwards
Hence after 25 moves, I am 21 steps away from my original starting point, so my walk back is $\boxed{21}$ steps long.
When we find the prime factorization of 555, we end up with $3\cdot5\cdot37$, which means we have $\boxed{3}$ prime positive divisors.
Stephan does not have any repeated letters in his name
Therefore, his name can be rearranged in $7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1 = 5,\!040$ ways
Then, we are given that he can write $12$ of these rearrangements every minute
Therefore, it takes him $\dfrac{5,\!040}{12} = 420$ minutes to write all the possible rearrangements
Finally, there are $60$ minutes in an hour, so we have: $$420\text{ minutes} = \dfrac{420}{60}\text{ hours} = \boxed{7\text{ hours}.}$$
Let Pete's original number be $x$
If he double it and adds 10, he will have $$2x+10.$$ After multiplying by 4, Pete ended up with 120
From this information, we have the equation: $$4(2x+10)=120.$$ Expanding the left side and solving, we find:
\begin{align*}
8x+40&=120\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 8x&=80\\
\Rightarrow \qquad x&=\boxed{10}.
\end{align*}
First, we convert $0.\overline{9}$ to fraction form
Let $a=0.\overline{9}.$ Multiply both sides of this equation by $10$ to get $10a=9.\overline{9}.$ Subtracting the left-hand sides $10a$ and $a$ as well as the right-hand sides $9.\overline{9}$ and $0.\overline{9}$ yields $9a=9$, which implies that $a=1.$ So, \begin{align*}1-0.\overline{9} &= 1-a\\ &= 1-1\\ &= \boxed{0}.\end{align*}
To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to divide the total distance by the total time
Remembering that $d=r\cdot t$, and looking at each of the four parts of the trip, these pieces can be determined.
First, a car traveling at 40 kph for 20 km will be traveling for $20/40=.5$ hours
Next, a car traveling at 50 kph for 25 km will be traveling for $25/50=.5$ hours
Next, a car traveling at 60 kph for 45 minutes (.75 hours) will travel a total of $60\times .75=45$ km during that time
Finally, a car traveling 48 kph for 15 minutes (.25 hours) will travel a total of $48\times .25=12$ km.
The total distance traveled was $20+25+45+12=102$ km
The total time was $.5+.5+.75+.25=2$ hours
Therefore, the average speed of the car was $102/2=\boxed{51}$ kph.
Since the square has area 81 square units, it must have side length $\sqrt{81}=9$ units (all number lengths will be in units henceforth)
The boundary consists of four straight segments of length $9/3=3$ and four quarter-circle arc segments
Notice how the four quarter-circle arc segments comprise a full circle of radius $3$; thus their total length is equal to that of the circumference of a circle of radius $3$, which is $6\pi$
The total length of the four straight segments is simply $3 \cdot 4 = 12$
Hence the total length of both type of segments is $6\pi + 12$, which is approximately 30.84956
To the nearest tenth, this value is $\boxed{30.8}$.
$\$32$ is equal to 3200 cents
Since $n$ stamps cost $33n$ cents, we can buy $n$ stamps only if $33n \le 3200$
Dividing both sides of this inequality by $33$, we get $$n\le \frac{3200}{33}.$$We want to know the largest integer $n$ which satisfies this inequality (since we can only buy an integer number of stamps)
We note that \begin{align*}
\frac{3200}{33} &= \frac{3300}{33} - \frac{100}{33} \\
&= 100 - 3\frac{1}{33} \\
&= 96\frac{32}{33},
\end{align*}so the largest number of stamps we can buy is $\boxed{96}$.
All 16 people shake hands with 12 other people (everyone except themselves and the other representatives from their company)
In multiplying $16 \times 12$, each handshake is counted twice, so we divide by two to get the answer of $\dfrac{16 \times 12}{2} = \boxed{96}$ handshakes.
For each vertex, we can create a diagonal by connecting it to any non-adjacent vertex
If there are $n$ vertices, there are $n(n-3)$ diagonals we draw
But we are over-counting by a factor of 2 since each diagonal can be created from 2 vertices
So there are $n(n-3)/2$ diagonals
In this problem, since $n=7$, there are $7\cdot4/2=\boxed{14}$ diagonals.
There is a pattern here: we notice that $9009 = 9000 + 9 = 9 \times 1000 + 9 \times 1 = 9 \times 1001$, while similarly $14,014 = 14 \times 1001$
Since $9$ and $14$ have no factors in common, it follows that the greatest common factor of $9,009$ and $14,014$ is $\boxed{1001}$.
The average of $r$, $s$, and $t$, is $\frac{r+s+t}{3}$
Dividing both sides of the given equation by 4, we get $\frac{r+s+t}{3}=\boxed{3}.$
Note that the numbers increase by 3 each time
Hence we increase by 3 a total of $\frac{32 - (-4)}{3} = 12$ times
But then there must be $12 + 1 = \boxed{13}$ numbers, since we need to also include the first number on the list.
Since 5250 is divisible by 50, Joneal is back at point $S$ after running 5250 feet
For the next 12.5 feet, he is on the portion of the track marked $A$
For the next 12.5 feet after that, he is on the portion of the track marked $B$
At this point he has traveled $5250+12.5+12.5=5275$ feet
After traveling the final 5 feet, he is on the portion of the track marked $\boxed{C}$.
The cost of $n$ cards is $(0.85)n$ dollars
Jasmine can buy $n$ cards only if $(0.85)n \le 7.5$
Rewriting this inequality in terms of fractions, we have $$\frac{17}{20}n\le \frac{15}{2}.$$ Multiplying both sides by $\frac{20}{17}$ gives $$n \le \frac{150}{17},$$ and converting to mixed numbers gives $$n \le 8\frac{14}{17}.$$ Since Jasmine must buy a whole number of trading cards, the largest number she can afford is $\boxed{8}$.
Since the measure of angle $C$ is twice the measure of angle $B$, $\angle C = 2\cdot 21^\circ = 42^\circ$
It follows that $\angle A = 180^\circ - 21^\circ - 42^\circ = \boxed{117^\circ}$.
We tackle the parentheses, then the exponent, then the product, then the sum: \begin{align*}
8+6(3-8)^2 &= 8 + 6(-5)^2\\
&= 8+6\cdot 25\\
&= 8+150\\
&=\boxed{158}.
\end{align*}
We can add $0.5$ to each member of the list, to make it easier to deal with: $$
2, 6, 10, 14, \ldots, 42, 46.
$$ If we add 2 to each of the terms, we get: $$
4, 8, 12, 16, \ldots, 44, 48.
$$ Now if we divide by 4, we get $$
1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots, 11, 12,
$$ so there are $\boxed{12}$ numbers in the list.
Dividing $-100$ by $9$ gives $-11$ with a remainder of $-1$
In other words, $$-100 = -11 \cdot 9 + (-1).$$This means that $-11 \cdot 9 = -99$ is greater than $-100$
Because the negation of $99$ is $-99$, $\boxed{99}$ is the largest multiple of $9$ whose negation is greater than $-100$.
We could also divide $-100$ by $9$ to get $-12$ with a positive remainder of $11$
However, $-12 \cdot 9$ is less than $-100$, so $$-100 = -12 \cdot 9 + 11$$would not help.
We perform division, going from left to right, to get our answer: \[88 \div 4 \div 2 = 22 \div 2 = \boxed{11}.\]
Since the choice of all the first four digits has no bearing on what the units digit is, we consider only what the units digit is
Since the last digit is less than 5, it can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4
And there are 10 digits to choose from in total, so the probability is $\frac{5}{10} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
All 12 people shake hands with 10 other people (everyone except themselves and their spouse)
In multiplying $12 \times 10$, each handshake is counted twice, so we divide by two to get the answer of $\dfrac{12 \times 10}{2} = \boxed{60}$ handshakes.
First, recall that $(-a)^{n}=a^n$ for even $n$ and $(-a)^{n}=-a^n$ for odd $n$
This means that $(-7^{3})^{3}=-(7^{3})^{3}$ and $(-7)^{10}=7^{10}$
We get $$\frac{1}{(-7^{3})^{3}}\cdot(-7)^{10}=\frac{1}{-(7^{3})^{3}}\cdot7^{10}.$$Using the power to a power property, $(a^{m})^{n}=a^{mn}$ for nonzero $a$ and integers $m$ and $n$, we get that $-(7^{3})^{3}=-7^{9}$ and $$\frac{1}{-(7^{3})^{3}}\cdot7^{10}=\frac{1}{-7^9}\cdot7^{10}.$$Now because $\frac{1}{a^{n}}=a^{-n}$ for nonzero $a$ and positive integers $n$, we can write $\frac{1}{-7^9}$ as $-7^{-9}$
Finally, we use the rule for a product of powers, $a^{m}a^{n}=a^{m+n}$ for integers $m$ and $n$, to obtain  \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{-7^9}\cdot7^{10}&=-7^{-9}\cdot7^{10}\\
&=-1\cdot7^{-9}\cdot7^{10}\\
&=-1\cdot7\\
&=\boxed{-7}.
\end{align*}

First, let's calculate the area of the plot of land in cm
Then, we'll convert as the questions ask.
Recall the formula for the area of a trapezoid is given by $\mbox{Area} = (\mbox{bottom} + \mbox{ top})\times \mbox{height} \times \frac{1}{2}$, so the area of this trapezoid is $$(10 \mbox{cm} + 15 \mbox{cm}) \times 10 \mbox{cm} \times \frac{1}{2} = 125 \mbox{cm}^2.$$Now, we are given that $1 \mbox{ cm } = 2 \mbox{ miles }$
Squaring both sides, that means $$1 \mbox{ cm}^2 = 4 \mbox{ miles}^2.$$We are told that $1 \mbox{ miles}^2 = 640 \mbox{ acres}$, so the above equation is actually:
$$1 \mbox{ cm}^2 = 4 \mbox{ miles}^2 \times \frac{ 640 \mbox{ acres}}{1 \mbox{ miles}^2} = 2560 \mbox{ acres}.$$Finally, we can convert $$125 \mbox{ cm}^2 \times \frac{ 2560 \mbox{ acres}}{1 \mbox{ cm}^2} = \boxed{320000 \mbox{ acres}}.$$
Let the leg length of the isosceles right triangle be $x$, so the hypotenuse of the triangle has length $x\sqrt{2}$
The hypotenuse of the triangle is a side of the square, so the area of the square is $(x\sqrt{2})^2 = 2x^2$
The area of the triangle is $(x)(x)/2 = x^2/2$
So, the area of the pentagon is  \[\frac{x^2}{2} + 2x^2 = \frac{5x^2}{2}.\]Therefore, the fraction of the pentagon's area that is inside the triangle is  \[\frac{x^2/2}{5x^2/2} =\frac{x^2}{2}\cdot \frac{2}{5x^2} = \frac15 = \boxed{20\%}.\](As an alternate solution, consider drawing the two diagonals of the square
What do you find?)
$12 = 2^2 \cdot 3^1$ and $20 = 2^2 \cdot 5^1$, so $\gcd(12, 20) = 2^2 = \boxed{4}$.
The diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, so therefore the side length of the rhombus can be calculated as $\sqrt{5^2+12^2} = 13$
Therefore, the perimeter of the rhombus is $4 \times 13 = \boxed{52}$ inches.
To find the number of divisors an integer has, we can count the number of positive divisors and double the result
For example, the positive divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4 while the set of all divisors of 4 is $\{-1,-2,-4,1,2,4\}$
So the number with the most divisors will be the same as the number with the most positive divisors
We can find the number of divisors of an integer by finding the divisors in pairs
For example, to find the divisors of 15, we begin by listing \[
1, \underline{\hphantom{3}}, \ldots, \underline{\hphantom{3}}, 15.
\]Fifteen is not divisible by 2, so we skip to 3 and find $3\cdot 5 = 15$, so we fill in 3 and 5
Three and 5 are "buddies," since they multiply to give 15
Our list becomes \[
1, 3, \underline{\hphantom{3}},\ldots \underline{\hphantom{3}}, 5, 15.
\]Since 15 is not divisible by 4, we are done (since 5 is the next number and we already have 5 on the list)
So the total list of divisors is \[
1, 3, 5, 15.
\]Since the numbers less than 15 are small, we can easily apply this process to all the numbers from 1 to 15
Here is a table showing how many factors each number has:
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
number & how many factors \\ \hline
1 & 1 \\
2 & 2 \\
3 & 2 \\
4 & 3 \\
5 & 2 \\
6 & 4 \\
7 & 2 \\
8 & 4 \\
9 & 3 \\
10 & 4 \\
11 & 2 \\
12 & 6 \\
13 & 2 \\
14 & 4 \\
15 & 4
\end{tabular}We see that $\boxed{12}$ has the most factors.
We have that Marguerite drove $100 \textnormal{ miles}$ in $2.4 \textnormal{ hours}$
We are told that this proportionality applies to Sam as well
So, if Sam drove for $3 \textnormal{ hours},$ he must have traveled $100 \textnormal{ miles} \cdot \frac{3 \textnormal{ hours}}{2.4 \textnormal{ hours}}$, or $\boxed{125\textnormal{ miles}}.$
The smallest square has side 8 and area $8^2=\boxed{64}$

To find the LCM of $3$, $4=2^2$, $6=2\cdot3$, and $15=3\cdot5$, take the highest power of each prime that appears and multiply: $2^2\cdot3\cdot5=\boxed{60}$.
We need to divide the amount of chocolate Jordan has by the the number of piles, so our expression is $\frac{48}{5} \div 4$
Recall that dividing is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal
Therefore, $\frac{48}{5} \div 4$ is the same thing as $\frac{48}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{4}.$ We can rewrite $\frac{48}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{4}$ as $\frac{1}{5} \cdot 48 \cdot \frac{1}{4}$, or $\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{48}{4}$
To simplify this, divide $48$ by $4$, which equals $12$
Our previous expression, $\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{48}{4}$, then equals $\frac{1}{5} \cdot 12$, which comes to $\frac{12}{5}$
So Shaina will receive $\boxed{\frac{12}{5}}$ pounds of chocolate.
Of the 36 taking math, there are 20 taking both math and physics, so there are $36-20= 16$ students taking only math
Similarly, there are $27-20= 7$ taking only physics
There are 50 students total, 16 in just math, 7 in just physics, and 20 in both math and physics, so there are  $50-16-7-20= \boxed{7}$ students taking neither.
Since $PQR$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, we have $PQ = PR\sqrt{3} = 9\sqrt{3}\cdot \sqrt{3} = 9\cdot 3 = \boxed{27}$.
The sum of the probabilities of each of the possibilities must be equal to 1
This means that the sum of the probability of randomly selecting a red jelly bean, the probability of randomly selecting an orange jelly bean, and the probability of randomly selecting a yellow jelly bean is equal to 1
If we let the probability of randomly selecting a yellow jelly bean be $x$, then we have \begin{align*}0.2+0.5+x&=1\\\Rightarrow0.7+x&=1\\\Rightarrow{x}&=1-0.7\\\Rightarrow{x}&=0.3\end{align*} Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a yellow jelly bean from this jar is $\boxed{0.3}$.
Add $x$ and subtract 8 from both sides to find that $x=5-8=\boxed{-3}$.
Since the angle measures are in the ratio $5:6:7$, the measures are $5x$, $6x$, and $7x$ for some value of $x$
Since these are the angles of a triangle, we have $5x+6x+7x = 180^\circ$, so $18x = 180^\circ$ and $x = 10^\circ$
Therefore, the largest angle is $7x = \boxed{70^\circ}$.
A number is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits is also divisible by $9$
So $9$ divides $8 + 3 + A + 5 = 16 + A$
Here, the only digit that works is $A = \boxed{2}$, which yields $16 + A = 18$.
The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $\dfrac{1}{3}((x+6)+(6x+2)+(2x+7))$
Simplifying this expression gives $\dfrac{1}{3}(9x+15)=3x+5$
We know the average is also $4x-7$, so $3x+5=4x-7$
Subtracting $3x-7$ from both sides of this equation gives $x=\boxed{12}$.
Since the area of the square is 144, each side has length $\sqrt{144}=12$
The length of the string equals the perimeter of the square which is $4 \times 12=48$
The largest circle that can be formed from this string has a circumference of 48 or $2\pi r=48$
Solving for the radius $r$, we get $r=\frac{48}{2\pi} = \frac{24}{\pi}$
Therefore, the maximum area of a circle that can be formed using the string is $\pi \cdot \left( \frac{24}{\pi} \right)^2 = \frac{576}{\pi} \approx \boxed{183}$.
There are four 5's and 52 cards total, so the probability that the top card is a 5 is $\dfrac{4}{52} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{13}}$.
To calculate how much taller the oak tree is than the elm tree, we must subtract the height of the elm tree from the height of the oak tree
We'll do this by using the fact that $11\frac{2}{3} = 11 + \frac{2}{3}$ and $17\frac{5}{6} = 17 + \frac{5}{6}$ and that $3$ and $6$ have a common denominator of $6$
We get \begin{align*}
17\frac{5}{6} - 11\frac{2}{3} &= 17 + \frac{5}{6} - (11 + \frac{2}{3}) \\ &= 17 + \frac{5}{6} - 11 - \frac{2}{3} \\ &= 17 - 11 + \frac{5}{6} - \frac{2}{3} \\ &= 6 + \frac{5}{6} - \frac{2}{3} \\ &= 6 + \frac{5}{6} - \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{2} \\ &= 6 + \frac{5}{6} - \frac{4}{6} \\ &= 6 + \frac{1}{6} \\ &= \boxed{6\frac{1}{6}\text{ feet}}.
\end{align*}
The only side of Figure 2 we are not given is the bottom
This is the sum of the top horizontal segments in Figure 1, which is $2+1+1=4$
So the length of the segments in Figure $2$ is $8+4+6+1=\boxed{19}$.
To obtain this probability, we want to take the number of double pairings over the total number of pairings
Because each integer is paired with each other integer exactly once, we must be careful when counting how many integer pairings there are
That is, $0$ can be paired with $10$ other numbers, $1$ can be paired with $9$ other numbers (not $0$, because we've already paired $0$ and $1$), $2$ can be paired with $8$ other numbers, etc
So, there are $10 + 9 + \ldots + 1 = 55$ pairings
Ten of these pairings are doubles ($00$, $11$, etc.)
Thus, the probability of choosing a double is $\frac{10}{55}$, which simplifies to $\boxed{\frac{2}{11}}$.
The average of two numbers is exactly half-way between them
Therefore, $\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2}{3}+\frac{4}{5}\right)=\boxed{\frac{11}{15}}$ is half-way between $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{4}{5}$.
The area is $100\pi=\pi r^2$, so $r=10$
The diameter is $2r=\boxed{20}$ centimeters.
When we write $\frac{5}{33}$ as a decimal using long division, we get $0.\overline{15}=0.15151515\ldots$
Notice the pattern we have here: if $n$ is odd, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal point is $1$; if $n$ is even, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal place is $5$
Since $92$ is an even number, the digit at the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point is $\boxed{5}.$
Since $\frac{27}{9} =3$, Rosie has 3 times the number of apples she needs to make 2 pies
So, she can make $2\cdot 3 = \boxed{6}$ pies.

First, we simplify $3^3=3\cdot3\cdot3=27$, and $4^2=4\cdot4=16$
Subtracting $16$ from both sides, we find $n=27-5-16=\boxed{6}$.
In the fourth row, the digit $9$ appears $4$ times
This is the greatest number of appearances of a digit in any row, so the mode is $\boxed{89}.$
If the length of the rectangle is decreased by $10\%$, it will be $90\%$ of what it was
If the width is increased by $10\%$, it will be $110\%$ of what it was
The area will be $0.9 \times 1.1 = 0.99 = 99\%$ of what it was
Thus, $99\%$ of 432 is $0.99 \times 432 = 427.68$ or about $\boxed{428\text{ square centimeters}}$.
If we let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$, then the original area of the rectangle is $lw$
The length is then increased $20\%$ to $1.2l$ and the width is increased $10\%$ to $1.1w$, so the new area is $(1.2l)(1.1w)=1.32lw$
There new area is $132\%$ the old area, which represents a change of $\boxed{32 \%}$.
The median of a set of consecutive integers is the middle value of that set
Since the median is an even number, but there are only odd integers in this set, there must be an even number of integers in the set
The set must be $$\{131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145\},$$ and $\boxed{131}$ is the smallest integer in the set.
Because $\frac{1}{3}$ of the money was spent on movies and there is 30 dollars, the amount of money spent on movies is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 30=10$ dollars
Likewise, $\frac{3}{10} \cdot 30=9$ dollars were spent on music and $\frac{1}{5} \cdot 30 = 6$ dollars were spent on ice cream
Thus, the total amount of money spent on movies, music, and ice cream is $\$10+\$9+\$6=\$25$
The remaining amount of money is spent on burgers
Thus, the money spent on burgers is $\$30-\$25=\$\boxed{5}$.
There are 12 options for each ball to be drawn, so there are a total of $12^3 = \boxed{1728}$ possible drawings.
Because the ages form an arithmetic progression (an evenly spaced sequence) with an odd number of terms, the median age is the same as the average age
Therefore, the age of the third child is $6$, the second child is $8$ years old, and the first child is $\boxed{10}$ years old.
Since both 36 and 54 are multiples of 18, we can write $\frac{36}{54} = \frac{2 \cdot 18}{3 \cdot 18} =$ $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
We have the equation $y\cdot2/5=10$
Solving for $y$ yields $y=\boxed{25}$.
To average two real numbers, we sum them and divide by 2: \[
\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2}{5}+\frac{4}{7}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{14+20}{35}=\boxed{\frac{17}{35}}.
The sum of the digits of the integer is $A+27$, so the integer is divisible by $3$ if $A$ is 0, 3, 6, or 9, since these are the only possible values of the digit $A$ that make $A + 27$ divisible by 3
The largest of these is $\boxed{9}$.
Any convex pentagon may be subdivided into three triangles, each with a total angle sum of 180 degrees
Thus, the sum of the interior angles of any convex pentagon is $3 \times 180 = 540$ degrees
If the pentagon is regular, then each of its five angles will have the same measure of $540 \div 5 = \boxed{108\text{ degrees}}$.
Each team plays 10 games in its own division and 6 games against teams in the other division
So each of the 12 teams plays 16 conference games
Because each game involves two teams, there are $\frac{12\times 16}{2}=\boxed{96}$ games scheduled.
We can see that the diameters of three of the smaller circles make up the diameter of the larger circle
It follows that the radius of one of the smaller circles is one-third of the radius of the larger circle
Since the larger circle has a radius of 6 meters, our answer is $6/3 = \boxed{2}$ meters.
First we know that $1^{18}=1$
Then we see that $8\cdot10^{18}$ is 8 followed by 18 zeroes
So the sum is $800\cdots001$
A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9
In this case, the sum of the digits is $8+1=9$, so the number itself is a multiple of 9 and leaves a remainder of $\boxed{0}$ when divided by 9.
Checking the primes 2, 3, and 5 as potential divisors, we see that there are $\boxed{2}$ prime numbers between 20 and 30: 23 and 29.
Rearranging and grouping, we obtain $(5x - x) + (6 + 12) = \boxed{4x + 18}$.
Adding the numbers of students with A's in history and math gives $7+13 = 20$
But this counts the 4 kids who got A's in both twice, so there are $20-4=16$ different students total who received an A in at least one of the courses
That leaves $30-16=\boxed{14}$ who didn't get an A in either.
If we divide 99 (the largest two digit number) by 9, we get 11
So, there are 11 positive multiples of 9 that are less than or equal to 99
However, we must eliminate any that are not two digit numbers
The first multiple of 9 is $9\cdot1=9$ and the second is $9\cdot2=18$
So, only one positive multiple of nine is not at least a two digit number and there are $11-1=\boxed{10}$ two-digit multiples of 9.
$20\%$ empty is the same thing as $80\%$ full
Thus, 27 gallons represents the difference between $80\%$ and $30\%$ of the tank, meaning that 27 gallons is $50\%$ of the tank
Since half the tank is 27 gallons, the entire tank can hold $\boxed{54\text{ gallons}}$.
$0.\overline{36}=\frac{36}{99}=\frac{4}{11}$
The sum of the numerator and denominator is $4+11=\boxed{15}$.
Multiply both sides of the equation \[
\frac{15}{100}N=\frac{45}{100}(2003)
\] by 20 to find that $3N=9(2003)$
Divide both sides by 3 to obtain $N=3(2003)=\boxed{6009}$.
The first multiple of $10$ that is greater than $11$ is $20$, and the last multiple of $10$ that is less than $103$ is $100$
The list of multiples is $20$, $30$, $\ldots$, $100$
Divide each of these numbers by $10$ to get the list $2$, $3$, $\ldots$, $10$
Subtracting $1$ from each number in this list gives a new list of $1$, $2$, $\ldots $, $9$, so it is clear that there are $\boxed{9}$ such numbers.
If the mean of three numbers is 4, then their sum is 12
Since two of the numbers are 1 and 4, the third number is $12-(1+4)=7$
The range, which is the difference between the smallest and largest numbers, is $7-1=\boxed{6}$.
Every four-digit palindrome is of the form $ABBA$, where $A$ and $B$ are digits
The four-digit number $ABBA$ is divisible by 4 if and only if the two-digit number $BA$ is divisible by 4
In particular, the digit $A$ must be even.
Since $ABBA$ is a four-digit number, $A$ cannot be 0, so $A$ must be at least 2
For $A = 2$, so the smallest digit $B$ for which $BA = B2$ is divisible by 4 is 12
Therefore, the smallest smallest four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 4 is $\boxed{2112}$.
Because each man danced with exactly three women, there were $(12)(3)=36$ pairs of men and women who danced together
Each woman had two partners, so the number of women who attended is $36/2=\boxed{18}.$
There are two possible right triangles
One of the triangles has $4$ and $5$ as its legs, so by the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse has a length of $\sqrt{4^2+5^2}=\sqrt{41}$
The other possible triangle is that the longer length, $5$, is the hypotenuse
We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the other leg, or we recognize that $4$ and $5$ are part of the Pythagorean triple $(3,4,5)$, so the other leg has a length of $3$ units
Since the hypotenuse is the longest side in a right triangle, there isn't a triangle with a hypotenuse of $4$ and a leg of $5$
So $\sqrt{41}$ and $3$ are the only possible lengths of the third side
Using a calculator, we find that the product as a decimal rounded to the nearest tenth is $3\sqrt{41}=\boxed{19.2}$.
$\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4}$
Rearranging the denominator, we have the equivalent expression $\frac{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3}{4 \cdot 2 \cdot 3} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 3}{2\cdot 3} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 1$
Through cancelling similar terms in the numerator and denominator, we have found our answer: $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
Since the areas of the three squares are 16, 49 and 169, then their side lengths are $\sqrt{16}=4$, $\sqrt{49}=7$ and $\sqrt{169}=13$, respectively.
Thus, the average of their side lengths is $$\frac{4+7+13}{3}=\boxed{8}.$$
Recall that division is the same as multiplication by a reciprocal
In other words, if $b$ is nonzero, then $a \div b = a\cdot \frac{1}{b}$
In this case, \[
\frac{3}{4}\div \frac{7}{8} = \frac{3}{4}\cdot \frac{8}{7} = \frac{3\cdot 8}{4\cdot 7}=\frac{8}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{7} = 2 \cdot \frac{3}{7} = \boxed{\frac{6}{7}}.
The sum of the ages of the fifth graders is $33 \cdot 11,$ while the sum of the ages of the parents is $55 \cdot 33.$ Therefore, the sum of all their ages is \[33 \cdot 11 + 55 \cdot 33 = 33 (11 + 55) = 33 \cdot 66.\]Since there are $33 + 55 = 88$ people in total, their average age is \[\frac{33 \cdot 66}{88} = \frac{33 \cdot 3}{4} = \frac{99}{4} = \boxed{24.75}.\]
First, we prime factorize the given numbers: \[10=2\cdot5, \quad 14=2\cdot7, \quad 70=2\cdot5\cdot7.\]  Since the least common multiple of $10$ and $14$ is already $70$ ($2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$), we can maximize $x$ by letting it be $\boxed{70}$.
Let $S$ be the sum of the 10 numbers
Then the average of the 10 numbers is $\frac{S}{10}$, so $\frac{S}{10} = 85$, or $S = 850$
After 70 and 76 are removed, the sum of the remaining 8 numbers is $S - 70 - 76 = 850 - 70 - 76 = 704$
So the average of the remaining 8 numbers is $\frac{704}{8} = \boxed{88}$.
The perimeter of a polygon is defined to be the sum of the measures of the sides of the polygon
Therefore, the perimeter of a triangle whose sides measure 14 cm, 8 cm, and 9 cm is $\boxed{31}$ centimeters.
It takes $270/90=3$ hours for Robert to read one 270-page book
Thus, he can read $6/3=\boxed{2}$ 270-page books in six hours.
The problem specifies that the number of students in the band is a multiple of 6, 7, and 8
Therefore, we are looking for the least common multiple of 6, 7, and 8
Prime factorizing the three numbers and taking the maximum exponent for each prime, we find that the least common multiple is $2^3\cdot 3\cdot 7=\boxed{168}$.
The factors of $105$ are $\pm 1, \pm 3, \pm 5, \pm 7, \pm 15, \pm 21, \pm 35, \pm 105$
Of these, only $\pm 1$ and $\pm 7$ divide $14$
Their product is $-7\cdot -1\cdot 1\cdot 7 = \boxed{49}$.
We use the conversion factors $\frac{1\ \text{ft}}{12\ \text{in.}}$ and $\frac{30.5\ \text{cm}}{1\ \text{ft}}$ to find that Daniel's waist size in centimeters is $34\ \text{in.} \cdot \frac{1\ \text{ft}}{12\ \text{in.}} \cdot \frac{30.5\ \text{cm}}{1\ \text{ft}} \approx \boxed{86.4}$ centimeters.
The ratio between a length on the model and a length on the statue is $4\text{ inches}: 60\text{ feet}$
Dividing both sides by 4, we have that 1 inch on the model corresponds to $60/4=\boxed{15}$ feet on the statue.
If one acute angle of a right triangle is $45^\circ$, then the other is $90^\circ-45^\circ =45^\circ$, so the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle
The hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg, so each leg has 6
Therefore, the area of the triangle is $(6)(6)/2 = \boxed{18}$.
To express the number $0.\overline{12}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $100x$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&100x &=& 12&.121212\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.121212\ldots \\
\hline
&99x &=& 12 &
\end{array}$$This shows that $0.\overline{12} = \frac{12}{99}$.
But that isn't in lowest terms, since $12$ and $99$ share a common factor of $3$
We can reduce $\frac{12}{99}$ to $\frac{4}{33}$, which is in lowest terms
The sum of the numerator and denominator is $4 + 33 = \boxed{37}$.
We want to subtract $\frac{12}{5}$ from $3$
To do this, we get a common denominator of $5$
We get  $$3-\frac{12}{5} = \frac{15}{5}-\frac{12}{5}=\frac{15-12}{5}=\boxed{\frac{3}{5}}.$$
Consider the sequence 8, 16, 24, $\ldots$ of the numbers of stamps collected by Margaret on successive days
The mean of an arithmetic sequence is equal to its median, so the mean of this five-term arithmetic sequence is equal to the third term $\boxed{24}$.
Recall that multiplication should be done before addition and subtraction
So, \begin{align*}1+2\cdot3-4+5 &=1+(2\cdot3)-4+5\\ &=1+6-4+5=\boxed{8}.\end{align*}
The area of a parallelogram is $A = bh$, and since the base and height are both given, $A = 3\mbox{ ft} \times 15\mbox{ ft} = \boxed{45}$ square feet.
The side length of the square is at least equal to the sum of the smaller dimensions of the rectangles, which is $2+3=5$.

If the rectangles are placed as shown, it is in fact possible to contain them within a square of side length 5
Thus the smallest possible area is $5^2=\boxed{25}$.
We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \[1:2:7 = 1\cdot 20:2\cdot 20 :7\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\times 20=140$ dollars
Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\boxed{200}$ dollars.
Say you're one of the players
How many matches will you play?
Each player plays 7 matches, one against each of the other 7 players
So what's wrong with the following reasoning: "Each of the eight players plays 7 games, so there are $8 \times 7 = 56$ total games played"?
Suppose two of the players are Alice and Bob
Among Alice's 7 matches is a match against Bob
Among Bob's 7 matches is a match against Alice
When we count the total number of matches as $8 \times 7$, the match between Alice and Bob is counted twice, once for Alice and once for Bob.
Therefore, since $8 \times 7 = 56$ counts each match twice, we must divide this total by 2 to get the total number of matches
Hence the number of matches in an 8-player round-robin tournament is $\frac{8 \times 7}{2} = \boxed{28}$.
Since Brianna runs $\frac{2}{3}$ as fast as Eugene and he runs at a rate of 4 miles per hour, then Brianna runs at a rate of  $\frac{2}{3} \cdot 4 = \frac{(2)(4)}{3} = \frac{8}{3}$ miles per hour
Since Katie runs $\frac{7}{5}$ as fast as Brianna, Katie runs at a rate of $\frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{8}{3} = \frac{(7)(8)}{(5)(3)} = \boxed{\frac{56}{15}}$ miles per hour.
Simplifying both sides gives $8+2cy = 12y+8$
Subtracting $8$ from both sides gives $2cy = 12y$
If $c=\boxed{6}$, then this equation is always true, and the original equation is true for all $y$ (so it has infinitely many solutions)
Otherwise, the equation has only one solution ($y=0$).
If one centimeter on the map is 15 kilometers in reality, then we have the ratio $1 \text{ cm on map} : 15 \text{ km in reality}$
Multiplying the ratio by 88, we get $88 \text{ cm on map} : 15 \cdot 88 \text{ km in reality} =88 \text{ cm on map} : 1320 \text{ km in reality}$
Thus, the cities are $\boxed{1320}$ kilometers apart.
Recall that we must perform the operations inside the parentheses first
So, we must simplify $10+11\cdot 2$ first
Of these operations, we must do the multiplication and then the addition because multiplication and division must be done before addition and subtraction
We get \begin{align*}10+11\cdot 2 &=10+22 \\ &=32.\end{align*}Now, we substitute back into the original expression and do the division
Therefore, \begin{align*}160\div \left(10+11\cdot 2\right)&=160\div 32 \\ &=\boxed{5}.\end{align*}
The decimal representation of $\frac{6}{7}$ is $0.\overline{857142}$, which repeats every 6 digits
Since 100 divided by 6 has a remainder of 4, the 100th digit is the same as the fourth digit following the decimal point, which is $\boxed{1}$.
In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9
So in this case the known digits sum to $4+3+7+0+3=17$, so $17+d$ must be divisible by 9
Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 17, $d$ must equal $\boxed{1}$.
Firstly, we find that $\frac{.02}{.06}=\frac{1}{3}$ is the fraction of water in the solution
Thus, since Samantha wants $.48$ total liters of the solution, we have that she must use $.48 \times \frac{1}{3}=\boxed{0.16}$ liters of water.
If $x=-3$, then $-3 = 2-t$, so $t = 5$
Therefore, $y = 4(5) +7 =\boxed{27}$.
First we simplify $\frac{8}{10}$, \[
\frac{8}{10} = \frac{2}{2}\cdot\frac{4}{5}=1\cdot\frac{4}{5} =\frac{4}{5}.
\]Now make both terms have a common denominator, \[
\frac{2}{7}+\frac{4}{5}= \frac{5}{5}\cdot\frac{2}{7}+\frac{7}{7}\cdot\frac{4}{5} = \frac{10}{35}+\frac{28}{35}
=\boxed{\frac{38}{35}}.
\]Note that we could have done the problem without simplifying $\frac{8}{10}$ at the beginning and instead simplified at the end, but in this case simplifying first made things simpler as we didn't need to carry around the extra factor of two.
When the figure is divided, as shown the unknown sides are the hypotenuses of right triangles with legs of 3 and 4
Using the Pythagorean Theorem yields $AB=CD=5$
The total perimeter is $16+5+8+5=\boxed{34}$

If the polygon has 23 sides, then it has 23 vertices
A diagonal is created by choosing 2 non-adjacent vertices and connecting them
First we choose a vertex
There are 23 choices
Then we choose another vertex that is not adjacent to the one we already chose
There are 20 choices for this
However, we have double counted all the diagonals, so the number of diagonals is $\frac{23 \cdot 20}{2}=23 \cdot 10=\boxed{230} \text{ diagonals}$.
$91$ is the first number that makes it hard to tell whether it's prime or not
Anything smaller, you can check if it's even, or ends in a $5$, or the digits sum to $3$, or maybe it's the same digit repeated twice, such as $77$
Remember that $91$ is not prime!
$87$ factors as $3\cdot29$, $89$ is prime, $91$ factors into $7\cdot13$, and $93$ as $3\cdot31$
All together, that is $3^2\cdot7\cdot13\cdot29\cdot31\cdot89$, for a total of $\boxed{6}$ different prime factors.
If we let $E$ be the midpoint of line segment $AB$ and $F$ be the midpoint of $CD$, then line segment $MF$ will pass through point $E$
Also, $MF$ is perpendicular to $CD$, so $\triangle MFC$ is a right triangle
Now, if we can find the lengths of $MF$ and $FC$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $MC$.

Since $F$ is the midpoint of $CD$ and $CD$ has length $6$, $FC$ has length $3$
$EF$ has length $6$, because it has the same length as the side length of the square
$ME$ is the radius of the semicircle
Since the diameter of the semicircle is $6$ (the same as the side length of the square), $ME$ has length $3$
Now, $MF = ME + EF = 3 + 6 = 9$
Finally, from the Pythagorean Theorem, we have that $MC^2 = MF^2 + FC^2 = 9^2 + 3^2 = 90$, so $MC = \sqrt{90} = \boxed{3\sqrt{10}}$ cm.
To be divisible by 2, 3, and 5, a number must be divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of those three numbers
Since the three numbers are prime, their LCM is simply their product, $2\cdot3\cdot5=30$
Since $30\times 6 = 180$ is the largest multiple of 30 which is less than 200, the numbers $30\times 1, 30 \times 2, \ldots, 30\times 6$ are the $\boxed{6}$ positive integers less than 200 that are divisible by 2, 3, and 5.
We have to account for each possible value of $n$ here
First of all, we can quickly find that for $n = 1, 2, 5,$ the resulting number $14n$ must be divisible by $n$, using their respective divisibility rules.
We see that for $n = 3$, we get $143.$ Since $1 + 4 + 3 = 8,$ which is not a multiple of $3,$ we can see that $n = 3$ does not work
Moreover, if $143$ is not divisible by $3$, then $146$ and $149$ are not divisible by $3$ or any multiple of $3$, so $n = 6$ and $n = 9$ do not work.
For $n = 4$, we can see that $144$ is divisible by $4$ because $44$ is divisible by $4,$ so $n = 4$ works.
For $n = 7$, we can easily perform division and see that $147$ is divisible by $7,$ so $n = 7$ works.
For $n = 8$, we have little choice but to find that $\dfrac{148}{8} = \dfrac{37}{2},$ and so $n = 8$ does not work.
All in all, we have that $n$ can be $1,$ $2,$ $4,$ $5,$ or $7,$ so we have $\boxed{5}$ possible choices for $n$ such that $14n$ is divisible by $n.$
We have an isosceles triangle with a base of 4 units and legs of 3 units each
We know that with an isosceles triangle, the altitude bisects the base
So drawing the altitude splits the isosceles triangle into two right triangles that share a side (the altitude) and have a leg of half the base
For each of the right triangles, the hypotenuse is 3 units, while one of the legs is 2 units, half of the isosceles triangle's base
We solve for the length of the other leg (the height of the isosceles triangle) with the Pythagorean Theorem: $a^2=c^2-b^2$, so $a^2=3^2-2^2$ and $a=\sqrt{5}$
Now we know the base of the isosceles triangle is 4 units and the height is $\sqrt{5}$ units, so the area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(4)(\sqrt{5})=\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}$ square units.
First, we have to figure out what the problem is asking
The words "is greater than" tell us that there's an inequality
To write it down in math notation, we start by defining a variable $n$ as the mystery number.
Then the "product of 4 and a number" is $4n$, and the difference when this is subtracted from $16$ is $16-4n$
So, the inequality says that $$16-4n > 10.$$ To solve this inequality, we can start by subtracting $10$ from both sides: $$6-4n > 0.$$ Then we add $4n$ to both sides: $$6 > 4n.$$ Finally, we divide both sides by $4$ to get $$1\dfrac 12 > n.$$ The only positive integer satisfying this inequality is $n=1$, so there is $\boxed{1}$ such number.
The number can't have $2$ as a factor, so the next smallest primes are $3$, $5$, $7$, and $11$
Multiply them together to get $\boxed{1155}$.
The sum of the six given integers is $1867+1993+2019+2025+2109+2121=12134$.
The four of these integers that have a mean of 2008 must have a sum of $4(2008)=8032$
(We do not know which integers they are, but we do not actually need to know.)
Thus, the sum of the remaining two integers must be $12134-8032=4102$.
Therefore, the mean of the remaining two integers is $\frac{4102}{2}=\boxed{2051}$.
(We can verify that 1867, 2019, 2025 and 2121 do actually have a mean of 2008, and that 1993 and 2109 have a mean of 2051.)
The least integer greater than $\sqrt{5}$ is $\sqrt{9}=3$
The greatest integer less than $\sqrt{50}$ is $\sqrt{49}=7$
There are $7-3+1=\boxed{5}$ integers between 3 and 7 inclusive.
The mean of the list 31, 58, 98, $x$ and $x$ is $(31+58+98+2x)/5=(187+2x)/5$, and the mode is $x$
Solving $1.5x=(187+2x)/5$ we find $x=\boxed{34}$.
Since the smaller square has a perimeter of 4 cm and its sides are equal in length, each side measures $4/4=1$ cm
Since the larger square has area 16 square cm, each side measures $\sqrt{16}=4$ cm
To find the length of $AB$, we draw a right triangle with $AB$ as the hypotenuse and the two sides parallel to the sides of the squares, as shown below: [asy]
draw((0,0)--(12,0));
draw((2,0)--(2,10));
draw((0,0)--(0,2));
draw((0,2)--(2,2));
draw((0,2)--(12,10));

draw((2,10)--(12,10));
draw((0,2)--(12,2)--(12,10),dashed);
label("B",(0,2),W);
label("A",(12,10),E);[/asy] The horizontal side has length $1+4=5$ (the length of the smaller square and the length of the larger square added together) and the vertical side has length $4-1=3$ (the length of the larger square minus the length of the smaller square)
Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of $AB$ is $\sqrt{5^2+3^2}=\sqrt{34}\approx\boxed{5.8}$ cm.
Substituting $c=3$ into the given expression, we find that $\left(3^3-3(3-1)^3\right)^3$
We must always begin in the parentheses first, so we calculate $(3-1)^3=2^3=8$
Now our expression is $\left(3^3-3\cdot 8\right)^3$
Carrying out exponentiation first, we find $\left(27-3\cdot 8\right)^3$
Next we do multiplication to get $\left(27-24\right)^3$
Finally, we carry out the subtraction last and we find $(3)^3$
Thus, our answer is $\boxed{27}$.
Since $3^3 = 3\times 3\times 3 = 3\times 9 = 27$, then  \[ \sqrt{3^3+3^3+3^3} = \sqrt{27+27+27}=\sqrt{81}=\boxed{9}
$1{,}000{,}000=10^6=(2\cdot5)^6=2^6\cdot5^6$
The roundness of 1,000,000 is therefore $6+6=\boxed{12}$.
Recall that the conventions for carrying out operations say that exponents come before negations
So $-1^{2004}$ means $-(1^{2004})$ and not $(-1)^{2004}$
Since any power of 1 is 1, then, we find $-1^{2004}=-1$
Since the exponent in the expression $(-1)^{2005}$ is odd, we have $(-1)^{2005}=-1$
The last two terms $1^{2006}$ and $1^{2007}$ are each 1
Putting everything together, we have $-1+(-1)+1-1=\boxed{-2}$.
For a number to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by 3 and 2
Since our number ${24{,}z38}$ is obviously an even number, we only need to worry about whether it is divisible by 3
In order to check divisibility by 3, we find the sum of our digits: $2 + 4 + z + 3 + 8 = 17 + z.$ In order for ${24{,}z38}$ to be divisible by 3, $17 + z$ must be divisible by 3, meaning that $z$ is $1,$ $4,$ or $7.$
We can verify that ${24{,}138},$ ${24{,}438},$ and ${24{,}738}$ are all divisible by 6, and therefore our answer is $1 + 4 + 7 = \boxed{12}.$
Factor 180 as $6^25$
Then $\sqrt{180} = \sqrt{6^2}\sqrt5 = \boxed{6\sqrt5}$.
Since 8899.50241201 is between 8899 and 8899+1=8900, rounding to the nearest whole number will give either 8899 or 8900
Since 0.50241201 is bigger than 0.5, we find that 8899.50241201 is closer to $\boxed{8900}.$
The diagonals of a rhombus intersect at a 90-degree angle, partitioning the rhombus into four congruent right triangles
The legs of  one of the triangles are 6 feet and 9 feet, so the hypotenuse of the triangle - which is also the side of the rhombus - is $\sqrt{(6^2 + 9^2)} = \sqrt{(36 + 81)} = \sqrt{117}$ feet
Since $117 = 9 \times 13$, we can simplify this as follows: $\sqrt{117} = \sqrt{(9 \times 13)} = \sqrt{9} \times \sqrt{13} = 3\sqrt{13}$ feet
The perimeter of the rhombus is four times this amount or $4 \times 3\sqrt{13} = \boxed{12\sqrt{13}\text{ feet}}$.
Note that if $a$ is positive and is a factor of twenty, then $-a$ is a factor of 20 as well
Thus, we can count the positive factors, and then multiply by 2 at the end
Using the buddy method, we list the factors: \[1,_,\dots,_,20\]20 is divisible by 2, so we add it and its buddy $\frac{20}{2}=10$
\[1,2,_,\dots,_,10,20\]20 is not divisible by 3, so we move on to 4
4 is a factor of 20, so we add it and its buddy $\frac{20}{4}=5$
Thus, our final list of factors is \[1,2,4,5,10,20\]There are 6 numbers in this list, so there are $6 \cdot 2=\boxed{12}$ total factors.
Note that 55 and 11 have a common factor of 11
Also, 4 and 16 have a common factor of 4
Since there is one negative sign among all the factors, our result will be negative
We get \[
3\cdot\frac{11}{4}\cdot \frac{16}{-55}=-3\cdot\frac{\cancel{11}}{\cancel{4}}\cdot \frac{\cancelto{4}{16}}{\cancelto{5}{55}} \quad =-\frac{3\cdot 4}{5}=\boxed{-\frac{12}{5}}.
Let $x$ be a multiple of $6$
Then $x = 6 \cdot n$ for some integer $n$
So $x = 2 \cdot (3n)$ and $x = 3 \cdot (2n)$
This means that $x$ is a multiple of $3$ and $x$ is a multiple of $2$
So multiples of $6$ must be multiples of $2$ and multiples of $3$.
Every number that is a multiple of both 2 and 3 must also be a multiple of the least common multiple of 2 and 3, which is 6
Hence any number that is a multiple of $3$ and a multiple of $2$ is a multiple of $6$.
We have shown that the numbers that are multiples of $6$ and the numbers that are multiples of $2$ and multiples of $3$ are exactly the same numbers, since any multiple of $6$ is a multiple of $2$ and a multiple of $3$, and any number that is a multiple of $2$ and a multiple of $3$ is a multiple of $6$
So we must have $a = b$
A number minus itself is zero, so our final answer is   $$(a - b)^3 = 0^3 = \boxed{0}.$$
If the socks are different, either white and brown, brown and blue, or white and blue can be picked
If the socks are white and brown, there are 4 options for the white sock and 4 options for the brown sock for a total of 16 choices
If the socks are brown and blue, there are 4 options for the brown sock and 2 options for the blue sock for a total of 8 choices
If the socks are white and blue, there are 4 options for the white sock and 2 options for the brown sock for a total of 8 choices
This gives a total of $16 + 8 + 8 = \boxed{32}$ choices.
In order for a number to be a multiple of 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9
Since $2+3+4+5=14$, the only single digit that will make the sum a multiple of 9 is $4$
The sum of the digits would be $18$, which is $9\cdot 2$, so $d=\boxed{4}$.
Expanding both sides of the equation $5(3x + 2) - 2 = -2(1 - 7x)$, we get \[15x + 10 - 2 = -2 + 14x.\]This simplifies to $15x + 8 = 14x - 2$, so $x = \boxed{-10}$.
This question gives multiple clues on what $x$ could be
Because $x^2>100$, we know that $x$ must be greater than 10, but $x$ is also less than 20
So $x$ is a multiple of 8 that is between 10 and 20
The only value that fits this description is $\boxed{16}$.
To start, let's list out the multiples of $5$: $5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35...$  Now, let's eliminate the multiples of $10$, and look for a pattern in the remaining numbers (which are the numbers we are trying to count): $5, 15, 25, 35,...$  It's easy to see that all multiples of $5$ that are not multiples of $10$ follow a pattern
They have a units digit of $5$.
The largest number below $250$ with a units digit of $5$ is $245$
All of these multiples are in the form $\_\_5$, where the blank can be filled with an integer between $0$ and $24$, inclusive
Therefore our answer is the number of integers between $0$ and $24$
There are $\boxed{25}$ integers in all.
We know that $1.\overline{03} = 1 + 0.\overline{03}$
Since $0.\overline{03}$ is three times greater than $0.\overline{01}$, we have $0.\overline{03} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{99} = \frac{3}{99}$
This simplifies to $\frac{1}{33}$
Then, adding one to this fraction, we get $1 + \frac{1}{33} =$ $\boxed{\frac{34}{33}}$.
Recall that $(-a)^n= a^n$ when $n$ is an even integer and $-a^n$ when $n$ is an odd integer
In particular, when $a=1$ this identity tells us that $(-1)^n = 1$ when $n$ is even and $-1$ when $n$ is odd
This includes $(-1)^0 = 1.$  So the sum in question becomes \[
1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + \cdots + 1 + (-1) + 1.
\]Since $1 + (-1)=0$, we can add these numbers up in pairs to get  \[
\underbrace{1 + (-1)}_0 + \underbrace{1 + (-1)}_0 + \cdots + \underbrace{1 + (-1)}_0 + 1 = 0 + 0 + \cdots + 0 + 1 = \boxed{1}.
If the diameter of the small circle is 2, then the radius is 1
Thus, the radius of the large circle is 4 times this, or 4
The area of the large circle is then $\pi4^2=16\pi$ and the area of the small circle is $\pi 1^2=1\pi$
We can then find the gray area to be the difference in these, or $16\pi-1\pi=\boxed{15\pi} \text{sq units}$.
Since $\angle ACE$ is a straight angle, $$\angle ACB=180^{\circ}-105^{\circ}=75^{\circ}.$$In $\triangle ABC,$ \begin{align*}
\angle BAC &= 180^{\circ}-\angle ABC - \angle ACB \\
&= 180^{\circ}-75^{\circ}-75^{\circ} \\
&= 30^{\circ}.
\end{align*}Since $AB$ is parallel to $DC,$ we have $$\angle ACD = \angle BAC = 30^{\circ}$$due to alternate angles
In $\triangle ADC,$ \begin{align*}
\angle DAC &= 180^{\circ}-\angle ADC - \angle ACD \\
&= 180^{\circ}-115^{\circ}-30^{\circ} \\
&= 35^{\circ}.
\end{align*}Thus, the value of $x$ is $\boxed{35}.$ [asy]

If we consider the five members of one team shaking hands with each of the five members of the other team, we can simply count the number of hands the members of one team shake, since this will necessarily count all of the handshakes of the other team
Thus, as each of the five people shakes five hands, this gives $5 \cdot 5 = 25$ handshakes
There are ten basketball players total, and if each shakes hands with two referees, this gives $10 \cdot 2 = 20$ more handshakes
Thus, a total of $25 + 20 = \boxed{45}$ handshakes occur.
We first notice that the area of the shaded region is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles
Each quarter circle has a radius half the side length, so if we sum the areas of the four quarter circles, we have the area of one full circle with radius $5$ cm
Now, we know the area of a square is the square of its side length, so the square has an area of $100 \text{ cm}^2$
A circle has an area of $\pi$ times its radius squared, so the four quarter circles combined have an area of $\pi(5)^2=25\pi \text{ cm}^2$
From this, we know that the area of the shaded region is $\boxed{100-25\pi} \text{ cm}^2$.
The actual degree measures of the acute angles don't matter
A right triangle consists of a right angle of $90^\circ$ and two acute angles that add up to $90^\circ$, so each of the two acute angles is smaller than the right angle
Also recall that the definition of an acute angle is that its degree measure is less than $90^\circ$
So the largest angle of the triangle is the right angle, which has a measure of $\boxed{90^\circ}$.
A 1 or 4 can be rolled for success, which is 2 out of 6 possible outcomes, so its probability is $\dfrac26 = \boxed{\dfrac13}$.
Triangle $PQR$ is a right-angled triangle since $\angle PQR=90^\circ$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle)
In $\triangle PQR,$ the Pythagorean Theorem gives,  \begin{align*}
\ PR^2&=PQ^2+QR^2 \\
\ 13^2&=12^2 + QR^2 \\
\ 169&=144+QR^2 \\
\ 169-144&=QR^2\\
\ QR^2&=25
\end{align*}So $QR=5$ since $QR>0.$ The area of $PQRS$ is thus $12\times 5=\boxed{60}.$
Partition the figure into rectangles as shown
The area of each rectangle is shown by the circled number in it
Total area $= 30+12+20 = \boxed{62}$.

$20\%$ of $200$ is $40$
So the new train goes $200+40=\boxed{240}$ miles.
A number is divisible by 4 if and only if the number formed by its last two digits are divisible by 4
The largest two-digit number that is divisible by 4 is 96, so the largest four-digit number that is divisible by 4 is $\boxed{9996}$.
For every integer $x$, $\boxed{0} = 0 \cdot x$ is a multiple of $x$.
There are $17-9=8$ albums in Andrew's collection but not John's, and $6$ albums in John's collection but not Andrew's
So there are $8+6=\boxed{14}$ albums in either Andrew's or John's collection, but not both.
The positive integers that divide exactly into $40$ are $1,$ $2,$ $4,$ $5,$ $8,$ $10,$ $20,$ $40.$
The positive integers that divide exactly into $72$ are $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $4,$ $6,$ $8,$ $9,$ $12,$ $18,$ $24,$ $36,$ $72.$
The numbers that occur in both lists are $1,$ $2,$ $4,$ $8,$ or $\boxed{\mbox{four}}$ numbers in total.
$24 = 2^3 \cdot 3^1$, $90 = 2^1 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1$, so lcm$[24, 90] = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 = \boxed{360}$.
The sum of all six scores is $549$
The sum of Cyprian's scores is $3(90)=270$, so the sum of Margaret's scores is $549-270=279$
Thus the average of her scores is $\frac{279}{3}=\boxed{93}$.
We are given that $\frac{9}{\text{S}}=\frac{\text{S}}{\text{T}}=3.$ \[\frac{9}{\text{S}}=3\] gives us $S=3,$ so \[\frac{\text{S}}{\text{T}}=3\] gives us $T=1$
There are 8 shaded squares with side length $\text{T}$ and there is 1 shaded square with side length $\text{S},$ so the total shaded area is $8\cdot(1\cdot1)+1\cdot(3\cdot3)=8+9=\boxed{17}.$
Recall that division should be carried out before addition
So  \[
1273 + 120 \div 60 - 173 = 1273 + (120 \div 60) - 173 = 1273 + 2 - 173.
\]Noticing that 1273 and 173 both end in 73, we write this expression as the sum of three numbers so we can use the commutative property of addition to rearrange
We get  \begin{align*}
1273 + 2 - 173 &= 1273 + 2 + (-173) \\
&= 1273 + (-173)+2 \\
&= 1273 -173 + 2 \\
&= 1100 + 2 \\
&= \boxed{1102}.
\end{align*}
8 players are taking biology, so $20 - 8 = 12$ players are not taking biology, which means 12 players are taking chemistry alone
Since 4 are taking both, there are $12 + 4 = \boxed{16}$ players taking chemistry.
The primes between 1 and 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7
Their sum is $2+3+5+7=\boxed{17}$.
The area is the square of the side length and the perimeter is 4 times the side length
If $s^2
= 4s$, then the side length, $s$, is $\boxed{4\text{ units}}$.
The arithmetic mean must be between the other two numbers, so we find the middle quantity by putting the fractions in a comparable form
We have $\frac{7}{10}, \frac{4}{5}=\frac{8}{10}, \frac{3}{4}=\frac{7.5}{10}$
The middle quantity is $\frac{7.5}{10}$, so the arithmetic mean is $\boxed{\frac34}$
Our answer makes sense since $7.5$ is the arithmetic mean of $7$ and $8$.
Looking at the third bar from the left that represents March, there are 8 people out of 100 born in that month, or $\boxed{8}$ percent.
Note that $\frac{7.8}{13} = 0.6$ and $\frac{9.1}{13} = 0.7.$ Since $\frac{9}{13}$ is closer to $\frac{9.1}{13}$ than to $\frac{7.8}{13},$ $\frac{9}{13}$ rounds to $\boxed{0.7}.$
The sum of the angle measures in a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$ degrees
So, the sum of the pentagon's angles is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees.
Let $\angle C$ and $\angle D$ each have measure $x$, so $\angle E = 2x + 15^\circ$
Therefore, we must have \[60^\circ + 85^\circ + x + x+ 2x + 15^\circ = 540^\circ.\] Simplifying the left side gives $4x + 160^\circ = 540^\circ$, so $4x = 380^\circ$ and $x = 95^\circ$
This means the largest angle has measure $2x + 15^\circ = 190^\circ + 15^\circ = \boxed{205^\circ}$.
There are $4\times 7\times 3=\boxed{84}$ ways to make three decisions if the numbers of options available for the decisions are 4, 7, and 3.
Finding $4^4$ and $5^4$ individually, then multiplying the result, is quite hard and time-consuming
So, let's list out the full product, and see if we can regroup anything: $$ 4^4 \cdot 5^4 = (4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4) \cdot (5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5) $$Now, multiplication is associative, so we can group a $5$ with each $4$, to get $ (4 \cdot 5) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)$, which equals $20 \cdot 20 \cdot 20 \cdot 20 = 400 \cdot 400 = \boxed{160000}$
In the last step, remember the rules of multiplying with zeros at the end.
There are 12 choices for the first position, then 11 players to choose from for the second, then 10 for the third, then 9 for the fourth, and finally just 8 for the fifth, for a total of $ 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 = \boxed{95,\!040}$.
The area of the square is $s^2$
Since the sides of the square all have the same length, the base of the triangle is $s$ (for the height drawn)
Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\frac12 sh$
Since these areas are equal, we have \[\frac12sh=s^2.\] Dividing both sides by $s$ and multiplying both sides by 2 gives $h = \boxed{2s}$.
Since $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^{-n}$, then we know $\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{-3} = \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^3$.
Also, we know $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$, so $\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{4^3}{3^3}$ and $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{8} = \frac{1^8}{2^8}$.
So, combining terms, we have $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{8} \cdot \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{-3} = \frac{4^3}{3^3} \cdot \frac{1^8}{2^8} = \frac{4^3 \cdot 1^8}{3^3 \cdot 2^8}$
We can simplify since $4^3 = 64 = 2^6$, and $\frac{2^6}{2^8} = \frac{1}{2^2}$ (since $\frac{a^k}{a^j} = a^{k-j}$).
Then, we solve for $\frac{4^3 \cdot 1^8}{3^3 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{1}{3^3} \cdot \frac{2^6}{2^8} = \frac{1}{3^3} \cdot \frac{1}{2^2}$
Since $3^3 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27$, and $2^2 = 4$, we plug in these values, and find our answer to be $\frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{27 \cdot 4} = \boxed{\frac{1}{108}}$.
There are 6 options for the first person and 5 options left for the second person for a preliminary count of $6\cdot5=30$ options
However, the order in which we choose the two members of the committee doesn't matter, so we've counted each pair twice, which means our final answer is $\dfrac{6\cdot5}{2}=\boxed{15}$ combinations.
Since the grade received varies directly with the time a student spends preparing, we know that the ratio of grade:time spent preparing is always constant
Thus, if we let $x$ be the score the student gets when she prepares for $4$ hours, we have that $$\frac{72 \text{ points}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{x}{4 \text{ hours}}.$$  Solving this equation for $x$, we have that $x = \frac{(72 \text{ points})(4 \text{ hours})}{3 \text{ hours}} = \boxed{96}$ points.
Using the Pythagorean Theorem, \begin{align*}
d&=\sqrt{75^2+100^2} \\
&=\sqrt{25^2(3^2+4^2)} \\
&=25\sqrt{3^2+4^2} \\
&=25\sqrt{9+16} \\
&=25\sqrt{25} \\
&=25 \cdot 5 \\
&=\boxed{125} \text{units}
\end{align*}
Each team plays 6 other teams in its division twice, and the 7 teams in the other division once, for a total of $6 \times 2 + 7 = 19$ games for each team
There are 14 teams total, which gives a preliminary count of $19 \times 14 = 266$ games, but we must divide by two because we have counted each game twice (once for one team and once for the other)
So the final answer is $\dfrac{19 \times 14}{2} = \boxed{133}$ games.
Recall that multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction
We get  \begin{align*}

Since $\angle ABC$ is a straight angle, we have $\angle ABD = 180^\circ - 108^\circ = 72^\circ$
From triangle $ABD$, we have  \[26^\circ + 72^\circ + x = 180^\circ,\]  so $98^\circ + x = 180^\circ$ and $x = \boxed{82^\circ}$.
The first even integer that is greater than $202$ is $204$, and the last even integer that is less than $405$ is $404$
So, the even numbers we must count are \[2\cdot 102, 2\cdot 103, 2\cdot 104, \ldots, 2\cdot 202.\]  Counting the numbers in this list is the same as counting the numbers in the list \[102, 103, 104, \ldots, 202.\] Subtracting 101 from each gives  \[1, 2, 3, \ldots, 101,\] so there are $\boxed{101}$ numbers.
We can choose two out of seven points (without regard to order) in $\dfrac{7 \times 6}{2} = 21$ ways, so there are $\boxed{21}$ chords.
We have $2y+3y+4y = (2+3+4)y=\boxed{9y}$.
The two small squares on the left-hand side both have side length $1$, so both have area $1 \cdot 1 = 1$
The larger square on the right has side length twice that of one of the smaller squares, giving it a side length of $2$ and an area of $4$
Thus, the area of rectangle $ABCD$ is $1 + 1 + 4 = \boxed{6}$ square inches.
To solve this problem, we first find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8
$6=2\cdot3$ and $8=2^3$, so their LCM is $2^3\cdot3=24$
Therefore, Xanthia can buy $24\div6=\boxed{4}$ hot dog packages and $24\div8=3$ hot dog bun packages to have an equal number of hot dogs and hot dog buns.
\begin{align*}

&=\left(2^2\cdot5^2\right)\times\left(11^2\cdot11^2\right)\\
&=10^2\times \left(11^2\right)^2\\
&=10^2\times 121^2
\end{align*} So $N=\boxed{121}$.
If the diameter is 6 meters, the radius is 3 meters
Therefore, the area of the circle is $\pi(3^2) = \boxed{9 \pi}$ square meters.
Recall that $1^n=1$ for positive integers $n$ and $(-a)^n=a^n$ for even $n$
So, $1^5=1$ and $(-1)^4=1$
Thus we get  $(1^5-(-1)^4)=(1-1)=0$
Since $0^n=0$ for all positive $n$, $0^{10}=0$ and we get  $$(5^7+3^6)(1^5-(-1)^4)^{10}=(5^7+3^6)\cdot0=\boxed{0}.$$
If we let $x =$ the number that we want to find, we know that $x/2$ must equal $x-2$
Multiplying both sides of the equation $x/2=x-2$ by $2$, we have that $x=2x-4$, so $x=\boxed{4}$.
If Aaron ate the most apples, then we look at the highest column, which marks 6 apples eaten
Zeb ate the fewest apples, so we look for the shortest column, which marks 1 apple eaten
That means Aaron ate $6-1=\boxed{5}$ more apples than Zeb.
The primes between 10 and 20 are 11, 13, 17, and 19

Let $n$ and $q$ represent the respective numbers of nickels and quarters
Since there are seven more nickels than quarters, we know that $q=n-7$
In cents, the amount of money Carol has is $5n+25q=455$
We substitute the expression of $q$ in terms of $n$ from the first equation into the second equation
\begin{align*}
5n+25(n-7)&=455\quad\Rightarrow\\
n+5(n-7)&=91\quad\Rightarrow\\
n+5n-35&=91\quad\Rightarrow\\
6n&=126\quad\Rightarrow\\
\end{align*} Carol has $\boxed{21}$ nickels in her piggy bank.
The prime factorizations of these integers are $154 =2\cdot7\cdot11$ and $252=2^2\cdot3^2\cdot7$
The prime factorization of their greatest common divisor (GCD) must include all of the primes that their factorizations have in common, taken as many times as both factorizations allow
Thus, the greatest common divisor is $2\cdot7=\boxed{14}$.
There are 13 $\heartsuit$'s and 52 cards total, so the probability that the top card is a $\heartsuit$ is $\dfrac{13}{52} = \boxed{\dfrac14}$.
Let $l$ represent the longer side of the rectangle, which makes the shorter side of the rectangle $y-l$ (since one long side and one short side make up $y$)
Then the perimeter of one of the rectangles is $2l+2(y-l)=2l+2y-2l=\boxed{2y}$.
Squaring both sides of the equation $\sqrt{1 - 3x} = 7$, we get $1 - 3x = 7^2 = 49$, so $x = (1 - 49)/3 = -48/3 = \boxed{-16}$.
Note that 111 and 9999 have a common factor of 3
Also, 33 and 3333 have a common factor of 33
We get \begin{align*}
\dfrac{\cancelto{37}{111}\hspace{8mm}}{\cancelto{3333}{9999}\hspace{8mm}} \cdot 33 &= \dfrac{37}{\cancelto{101}{3333}\hspace{6mm}} \cdot \cancelto{1}{33}\hspace{6mm} \\ &= \boxed{\dfrac{37}{101}}.

As per most two-die problems, the total number of outcomes is 36
So now we need to calculate the number of successful outcomes
There are 3 successful outcomes for the red die: it must show 1, 3, or 5
There are 2 successful outcomes for the green die: it must show 1 or 4
Since the rollings of the two dice are independent events, to get to number of successful outcomes for both dice, we multiply the counts for each die, so the number of successful outcomes is $3 \times 2 = 6$
Therefore, the probability of success is $\frac{6}{36} = \boxed{\frac16}$.
There are $120 - 30 = 90$ grams that are not filler
So $\frac{90}{120} = \boxed{75\%}$ is not filler.

There are $49+49+1=\boxed{99}$ students in Misha's grade.
A number is divisible by 5 if and only if it ends in 0 or 5, so there are only $\boxed{2}$ possible last digits.
We put the numbers in order: $0\ 0\ 1\ 2\ 2\ 5\ 15\ 16\ 23.$ To find the median, we find the middle value that separates the lower and upper halves of the data
There are $9$ planets, so the $5^\text{th}$ value will be the median (there are $4$ values below and $4$ values above the $5^\text{th}$ value)
The median is $\boxed{2}.$
Calculating under each square root first, $\sqrt{36+64}-\sqrt{25-16}=\sqrt{100}-\sqrt{9}=10-3=\boxed{7}$.
Recall that for any digit $d$ between 1 and 8 inclusive, $d/9=0.\overline{d}$
Rewrite $13/90$ as $\frac{1}{10}\cdot\frac{13}{9}$ to find that  \[
\frac{13}{90}=\frac{1}{10}\left(1\frac{4}{9}\right)=\frac{1}{10}(1.\overline{4})=0.1\overline{4}.
\]Every digit beyond the tenths digit is $\boxed{4}$.
The number of people who dislike radio is $.3(1200)=360$
Out of these, the number who also dislike music is $.1(360)=36$ people
So, $\boxed{36}$ people do not like both radio and music.
We see that $8^2+15^2=64+225=289=17^2$
So the triangle is a right triangle with legs $8$ and $15$, and thus its area is
$$\frac{8(15)}{2}=\boxed{60}$$
For any nonnegative number $n$, the value of $\sqrt{n}$ is the number whose square is $n$
So, when we square $\sqrt{n}$, we get $n$

We can list all of the positive factors of 372
They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 31, 62, 93, 124, 186, and 372
The greatest of these that is less than 50 is 31
However, 31 is not also a factor of 72
The positive factors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72
Then, we can see that the greatest divisor of 372 less than 50 that is also a factor of 72 is $\boxed{12}$.
We first add the two numbers: \begin{align*} 53.463+ 12.9873 &= 66.4503 \end{align*}In order to round to the nearest thousandth, we must look at the ten-thousandths digit, which here is 3
Because 3 is less than or equal to 4, the thousandths place remains 0
So, rounding 66.450 to the nearest thousandth yields $\boxed{66.450}$.
There is one King of $\diamondsuit$ and 52 cards total, so the probability that the top card is a King of $\diamondsuit$ is $\boxed{\dfrac{1}{52}}$.
There are 18 total slices, and 10 of them have pepperoni and 10 have mushrooms
Let there be $n$ slices that have both
Then there are $10-n$ with only pepperoni and $10-n$ with mushrooms

To make half of the recipe, only half of the $4 \frac{1}{2}$ cups of flour are needed
Since half of $4$ is $2$ and half of $\frac{1}{2}$ is $\frac{1}{4},$ we find that $\boxed{2\frac{1}{4}}$ cups of flour are needed.
The greatest common factor of 3 and $6=2\cdot3$ is 3
The least common multiple of 3 and $6=2\cdot3$ is $2\cdot3=6$
Their sum is $3+6=\boxed{9}$.
We can simply list the multiples of 13 until we reach one with 3 digits: 13, 26, 39, 52 ,65, 78, 91, 104
So, the greatest two-digit multiple of 13 is $\boxed{91}$.
Since 7 knicks = 2 knacks, we get the conversion factor $\frac{7\text{ knicks}}{2\text{ knacks}} = 1$
Likewise, we can get the conversion factor $\frac{3\text{ knacks}}{4\text{ knocks}} = 1$
We find that 24 knocks are equal to \[24\text{ knocks}\cdot \frac{3\text{ knacks}}{4\text{ knocks}} \cdot \frac{7\text{ knicks}}{2\text{ knacks}} = \boxed{63}\text{ knicks}.\]
The value of all quarters is $\$10.00.$ Each quarter has a value of $\$0.25.$ There are thus $10\div 0.25=40$ quarters in the jar.
Similarly, there are $10\div 0.05=200$ nickels, and $10\div 0.01=1000$ pennies in the jar.
In total, there are $40+200+1000=1240$ coins in the jar
The probability that the selected coin is a quarter is \[\dfrac{\mbox{the number of quarters}}{\mbox{the total number of coins}}=\dfrac{40}{1240}=\boxed{\dfrac{1}{31}}\].
We first solve the inequality: \begin{align*}

The denominators 3 and 7 have a common multiple of 21
We write $\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{7}{7}=\frac{7}{21}$ and $\frac{2}{7}\cdot\frac{3}{3}=\frac{6}{21},$ so we can add \[
\frac{7}{21}+\frac{6}{21}=\boxed{\frac{13}{21}}.
If $X$ is the midpoint of $OP$, the ratio of the radius of the circle with radius $OX$ to the radius of the circle with radius $OP$ is $1/2$
To find the ratio of the areas, we square this number: $(1/2)^2 = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
The order of operations says that we must perform the multiplication before the addition and subtraction
Recall that ``negative times positive equals negative" and ``negative times negative equals positive"
We obtain \begin{align*}
-8\cdot 4-(-6\cdot -3)+(-10\cdot -5)&=-32-18+50\\
&=-(32+18)+50\\
&=-50+50 \\
&=50+(-50) \\

From 30-60-90 right triangle $ACD$ with hypotenuse $\overline{AC}$ and shorter leg $\overline{CD}$, we have $AC = 2CD = 2\sqrt{3}$.
From 30-60-90 triangle $ABC$ with shorter leg $\overline{BC}$ and longer leg $\overline{AC}$, we have $AC = BC \sqrt{3}$
Since $AC = 2\sqrt{3}$, we have $BC = 2$
Therefore, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is  \[\frac{(AC)(BC)}{2} = \frac{(2\sqrt{3})(2)}{2} = \boxed{2\sqrt{3}}.\]
Since $88$ and $7744$ share a common factor of $88$, we can simplify $$\dfrac{88}{7744}=\dfrac{1 \cdot 88}{88 \cdot 88} = \dfrac{1 \cdot \cancel{88}}{88 \cdot \cancel{88}} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{88}}.$$
Note that the term inside the parenthesis must be simplified first, \[(3+3+5) = 11.\]This is substituted back into the original expression,  \[11 \div 2 - 1 \div 2 .\]Since $a\div c - b \div c = (a-b)\div c$, we have \[ 11 \div 2 - 1 \div 2 = (11-1) \div 2 = 10 \div 2 = \boxed{5} .\]
Since the measures of the angles are in the ratio $3:3:3:4:5$, their measures are $3x, 3x, 3x, 4x$, and $5x$ for some value of $x$
The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we must have  \[3x+3x+3x+4x+5x = 540^\circ.\] Simplifying the left side gives $18x = 540^\circ$, so $x = 30^\circ$, and the measure of the largest angle is $5x = 5(30^\circ) = \boxed{150^\circ}$.
Let the side length of the square be $x$
Then, the perimeter is $4x$ and the area is $x^2$
We're given that \[4x=x^2;\]solving yields $x=4$
Thus, the side length of the square is $\boxed{4}$ inches.
The trip would be $475-450 = 25$ miles less, and it takes 30 minutes to travel 25 miles at 50 mph, (25 is $\frac{1}{2}$ of 50, and thus, it takes $\frac{1}{2}$ of an hour) therefore, it would be $\boxed{30}$ minutes less.
Three dozen cost 1.5 times as much as two dozen, so the cost is $\frac32\cdot\$15.60=3\cdot\$7.80=\boxed{\$23.40}$.
$1337$ happens to be divisible by $7$
A fairly fast way to see this might be to note that $140-7=133$ is divisible by $7$, so $1330$ must be as well
Therefore, so is $1330+7= 1337$
Divide $1337$ by $7$ to get 191
Since 191 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17, and $17^2 = 289$ is greater than 191, we know that $191$ is prime
So, the prime factorization of 1337 is $7\cdot 191$, which means the largest prime factor of 1337 is $\boxed{191}$.
Yann can order 10 different dishes
After he has chosen a dish, Camille can also choose 10 different dishes
Thus there are a total of $10\cdot 10 = \boxed{100}$ different possible combinations of meals.
There are $36 - 20=16$ students taking only math, $27-20=7$ taking only physics, and 20 taking both
That leaves $60-16-7-20=\boxed{ 17}$ students taking neither.
All angle measures will be in degrees
$\angle DCB = 180 - 60 = 120$, and since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal, we have $\angle A = \angle DCB = 120$
Hence the degree measure of $\angle A$ is $\boxed{120}$.
The area of each rectangle is $6$, so the area of the square must be divisible by $6$
The smallest square side length that satisfies this is $6$
It is easy to see that we can tile a $6$ by $6$ square with $2$ by $3$ rectangles - split the rows into pairs of two, then cover each pair with two rectangles laid end-to-end
Since the area of the square is $6^2=36$, and each rectangle has area $6$, the number of rectangles required is $\boxed{6}$.
The perfect squares  between 20 and 150 are the ones from $5^2$ through $12^2$
Excluding the first 4 positive squares from the first 12 positive squares leaves $12-4 = \boxed{8}$ perfect squares.
The height, length, and diagonal are in the ratio $3:4:5$
The length of the diagonal is 27, so the horizontal length is $\frac{4}{5} (27) = \boxed{21.6}$ inches.
The sum of the angle measures in a hexagon is $180(6-2) = 720$ degrees
The angles of a regular hexagon are congruent, so each measures $720^\circ/6 = \boxed{120^\circ}$.
Sandy will need to cover an $8$ by $6$ rectangle and two $8$ by $5$ rectangles
Thus, she will need to have at her disposal a sheet that is $8$ by $16$, so she should buy two $8$ by $12$ feet sections
The total price will be $2 \cdot \$ 27.30 = \boxed{ \$ 54.60}$.
The smallest perfect cube inside this range is $5^3 = 125$ since $4^3 = 64.$  As for the highest cube, we know that $10^3 = 1000,$ which is outside the range, so we try $9^3 = 729.$  Therefore the cubes in question are $5^3,6^3,7^3,8^3,9^3$
So there are $\boxed{5}$ such cubes.
The hint is useful because it tells us that $2^{20}$ is equal to $1024^2$, which is slightly more than $1{,}000{,}000$, but is clearly less than $2{,}000{,}000$
Therefore, the largest power of $2$ which is less than $1{,}000{,}000$ is $2^{19}$
This tells us that $20$ of the integers smaller than $1{,}000{,}000$ are powers of $2$: $$2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \ldots, 2^{17}, 2^{18}, 2^{19}.$$
However, we have to exclude the $7$ numbers $$2^0, 2^3, 2^6, 2^9, 2^{12}, 2^{15}, 2^{18}$$ from our count, because these are all powers of $8$ (in general, $2^{3n}$ is the same as $(2^3)^n$, which is $8^n$)
That leaves us with $20-7 = \boxed{13}$ powers of $2$ that aren't powers of $8$.

All four right triangles are 30-60-90 triangles
Therefore, the length of the shorter leg in each triangle is half the hypotenuse, and the length of the longer leg is $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter leg
We apply these facts to each triangle, starting with $\triangle AOB$ and working clockwise.
From $\triangle AOB$, we find $AB = AO/2 = 4$ and $BO = AB\sqrt{3}=4\sqrt{3}$.
From $\triangle BOC$, we find $BC = BO/2 =2\sqrt{3}$ and $CO = BC\sqrt{3} =2\sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{3} = 6$.
From $\triangle COD$, we find $CD = CO/2 = 3$ and $DO = CD\sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3}$.
From $\triangle DOE$, we find $DE = DO/2 = 3\sqrt{3}/2$ and $EO =DE\sqrt{3} = (3\sqrt{3}/2)\cdot \sqrt{3} = (3\sqrt{3}\cdot \sqrt{3})/2 = \boxed{\frac{9}{2}}$.
In reading, $\text{speed}=\frac{\text{amount of material}}{\text{time}}.$ Let the amount of material in the novella be $N.$ So $\text{speed}=\frac{N}{\text{time}}.$
Also, it is a good idea to convert hours to minutes since the answer should be in minutes: $2hrs=2\cdot 60min= 120min.$
Knowing that my friend reads three times as fast as I do, we can set up a proportion of our speeds: $$\frac{\text{my friend's speed}}{\text{my speed}}=3.$$And now we can use the formula above to proceed
\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{my friend's speed}}{\text{my speed}}&=3\\
\frac{\frac{N}{\text{my friend's time}}}{\frac{N}{120\text{ min}}}&=3\\
\frac{N}{\text{my friend's time}}\cdot\frac{120\text{ min}}{N}&=3\\
\frac{N\cdot 120\text{ min}}{\text{my friend's time}\cdot N}&=3\\
\frac{120\text{ min}}{\text{my friend's time}}&=3\\
\text{my friend's time}&=\frac{120\text{ min}}{3}\\
\text{my friend's time}&=\boxed{40\text{ min}}.
\end{align*}
We are given the conversion factor $\frac{3\text{ pages}}{5\text{ cents}} = 1$
We want to find how many pages we can copy for $\$20$, which is equal to $2000$ cents
Thus, we can copy \[2000\text{ cents}\cdot \frac{3\text{ pages}}{5\text{ cents}} = \boxed{1200}\text{ pages}.\]
In order to combine the fraction and the integer into a single fraction, we write $2$ as a fraction with a denominator of $7$, or $\frac{14}{7}$
We get \[\frac{4+3c}{7}+\frac{14}{7}=\frac{4+3c+14}{7}=\boxed{\frac{18+3c}{7}}.\]
$20\%$ of a number is the same as multiplying by .2, and $10\%$ of a number is the same as multiplying by .1
Since a percent of a percent is simply multiplying two decimals, it does not matter what order we take the percentages - it will be the same result
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{12}$.
We can organize this subtraction quickly using columns as follows:   \[
\begin{array}{@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& 5 & 0 \\
- & 0 &
& 3 &2
\\ \cline{1-5}
& 1 & 8 \\
\end{array}
\]Therefore, $2.5-0.32 = \boxed{2.18}.$
To add these up quickly, a trick is to simply cancel out one of the $-4$ and the 1 and 3, because those will sum to 0, and then add up 2 and $-5$ to make $-3$
Pairing that with $-7$ to make $-10$, and then $-14$
Dividing by 7, we get an average of $\boxed{-2}$.
To express the number $0.4\overline{5}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&10x &=& 4&.55555\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.45555\ldots \\
\hline
&9x &=& 4&.1
\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.4\overline{5} = \frac{4.1}{9} = \boxed{\frac{41}{90}}$.
To count the number of numbers in this set, we subtract 49 from all of the numbers, giving the set $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots , 950 \}$, making it obvious that there are 950 numbers total
Furthermore, the set $\{ 50, 51, 52, \ldots, 98, 99 \}$ corresponds to the more easily counted $\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots , 49, 50 \}$ by subtracting 49
So, the probability of selecting a two-digit number is $\frac{50}{950} = \boxed{\frac{1}{19}}$.
There are $10(2)=20$ children total
If $2$ families are childless, $8$ have children
So the average number of children for a family with children is
$$\frac{20}{8}=\boxed{2.5}$$
She moved 60 feet in 30 minutes, meaning her rate is $\frac{60}{30} = 2$ feet per minute
She has $70\cdot 3 = 210$ feet remaining, meaning she will need $\frac{210}{2} = \boxed{105}$ more minutes.
Each coin has 2 possible outcomes, so the total number of possible outcomes is $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2=2^4=16$
Two of these are all tails and all heads, so the probability is $\frac{2}{16}=\boxed{\frac{1}{8}}$.
Let the three digit integer be $abc.$ We must have $a+b+c=5,$ and $a\geq 1.$ Let $d=a-1.$ Then $d,$ $b,$ and $c$ are all nonnegative integers with $d+b+c=4.$ We can view this as placing two dividers among four dots, which can be done in a total of $\binom{6}{2}=\boxed{15}$ ways.
Factoring all three numbers, we find that $10=2\cdot 5$, $11=11$, and $12=2^2\cdot 3$
Taking the highest power of each, we see that the least common multiple of the three numbers is $2^2\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 11=60\cdot 11=\boxed{660}$.
The area of the smaller square is $x\cdot x=x^2$ square inches
The area of the larger square is $4x\cdot4x=16x^2$ square inches
The ratio of the areas is $x^2/(16x^2)=\boxed{\frac{1}{16}}$.
The number of eggs in each basket is a common divisor of 18 and 24 that is at least 4
The common divisors of 18 and 24 are 1, 2, 3, and 6, so there are $\boxed{6}$ eggs in each basket.
Let $x$ be Tracy's starting number of candies
After eating $\frac{1}{3}$ of them, she had $\frac{2}{3}x$ left
Since $\frac{2}{3}x$ is an integer, $x$ is divisible by 3
After giving $\frac{1}{4}$ of this to Rachel, she had $\frac{3}{4}$ of $\frac{2}{3}x$ left, for a total of $\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{1}{2}x$
Since $\frac{1}{2}x$ is an integer, $x$ is divisible by 2
Since $x$ is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6.
After Tracy and her mom each ate 15 candies (they ate a total of 30), Tracy had $\frac{1}{2}x - 30$ candies left
After her brother took 1 to 5 candies, Tracy was left with 3
This means Tracy had 4 to 8 candies before her brother took some candies
Hence,  $$
4 \le \frac{1}{2}x - 30 \le 8\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 34 \le \frac{1}{2}x \le 38\qquad  \Rightarrow \qquad 68 \le x \le 76.
$$Since $x$ is divisible by 6, and the only multiple of 6 in the above range is 72, we have $x = \boxed{72}$.
Recall that the order of operations says that we must perform the multiplication and division before we do the addition and subtraction
Also, the operations inside the parentheses must be done before we negate the entire expression
Therefore, we have \begin{align*}-\left(14\div 2\cdot 9-60+3\cdot 9\right)&=-\left(7\cdot 9-60+3\cdot 9\right) \\ &=-\left(63-60+3\cdot 9\right) \\ &=-\left(63-60+27\right) \\ &=-\left(63+(-60)+27\right) \\ &=-\left(63+27+(-60)\right) \\ &=-\left(90+(-60)\right) \\ &=-\left(90-60\right) \\ &=-\left(30\right) \\ &=\boxed{-30}.\end{align*}
There are 12 choices for the first ball, 11 remaining choices for the second ball, and 10 remaining choices for the third ball, for a total of $12 \times 11 \times 10 = \boxed{1320}$ possible drawings.
There are four different bowls and four different glasses that Chandra can pick
Since her choices are mutually exclusive, there are $4 \times 4 = \boxed{16}$ possible pairings.
Two cubed is $2^3 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$
Eight cubed is $8^3 = 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = \boxed{512}.$
We have $\left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^{3}=\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{8}$, so \[\left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^{3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{7} \right) = \frac18\cdot \frac17 = \boxed{\frac{1}{56}}.\]
In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9
Since $2+4+6+8=20$, the only value of the missing digit that causes the sum of the digits to equal a multiple of 9 is $\boxed{7}$, as $27=9\cdot 3$.
Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so $8 \div \frac{1}{8} = 8 \cdot \frac{8}{1} = 8 \cdot 8 = \boxed{64}.$
The average of their scores is halfway between their scores
Thus, since their scores differ by 40, and Sarah's score is higher, her score is $102+\frac{40}{2} = \boxed{122}$.
You can do this more precisely by calling Sarah's score $x$, and Greg's score is therefore $x - 40$
Taking an average: $x - 20 = 102$, and thus, $x = 122$.
To get from 6 to 72 we multiply by 12, so a fraction equivalent to $\frac{5}{6}$ whose denominator is 72 has a numerator of $n=5 \cdot12=60$
We can solve $\frac{5}{6}=\frac{60+m}{84}$ similarly to obtain $m=10$
Finally, $\frac{5}{6}=\frac{p-10}{120}\implies p-10=100 \implies p=\boxed{110}$.
The perimeter of the triangle is $6.1+8.2+9.7=24$ cm
The perimeter of the square is also 24 cm
Each side of the square is $24\div 4=6$ cm
The area of the square is $6^2=\boxed{36}$ square centimeters.
If $200\%$ of $x$ is equal to $50\%$ of $y$, then $400\%$ of $x$ is equal to $y$
If $x = 16$, then $400\%$ of $x$ is $4x = y = \boxed{64}$.
For each of the $3$ goalies who stand in the net, there are $19$ other players who will kick to the goalie
That makes $3 \cdot 19 = \boxed{57}$ penalty kicks that must be taken.
There are 9 choices for the first digit (it can be 1-9) and 10 choices for each of the other 6 digits (they can be 0-9)
So there are $9 \cdot 10^6 = \boxed{9,\!000,\!000}$ possible numbers.
Since $12 + 8 + 6 = 26$, there are $36-26= 10$ children who prefer cherry or lemon pie
These ten are divided into equal parts of 5 each.
\[ \frac{5}{36} \times 360^{\circ} = 5 \times 10^{\circ} = \boxed{50^{\circ}}
Note that $7 \times 14 = 98 < 100 < 105 = 7 \times 15$ and $7 \times 142 = 994 < 1000 < 1001 = 7 \times 143$
So the list of 3-digit numbers divisible by 7 is $105,112,\ldots,994$, and when we divide this list by 7, we get the list $15,16,17,\ldots,141,142$, which has $142 - 15 + 1 = \boxed{128}$ numbers.
There are 20 different ways the parents can choose a provider for Laura
For each choice, there are 19 providers remaining that could be the provider for the first brother, and then 18 providers that could be chosen for the second brother
This gives $20 \times 19 \times 18 = \boxed{6840}$ different ways that the parents can gift the cellphones.
Suppose the side lengths of the triangle are $a$, $b$, and $c$, with $c$ the hypotenuse
Then $c^2 = a^2+b^2$ by the Pythagorean Theorem
We are told that $$a^2+b^2+c^2 = 1800.$$ Since $a^2+b^2=c^2$, then $c^2 + c^2 = 1800$ or $2c^2 = 1800$ or $c^2 = 900$ or $c=30$ (since the side lengths are positive)
So the hypotenuse has length $\boxed{30}$.
We can slide the triangles without changing their shape or area until one row of squares is shaded
This shaded row is one of the three rows of squares in the figure
Thus, the shaded area is $\boxed{\frac13}$ of the area of the quilt.
Notice that when we subtract two integers, the difference can only be odd if one integer is even and one integer is odd (even - even = even and odd - odd = even)
If one integer is even, then that integer is divisible by 2 and thus not prime
The only exception is 2, the only even prime number
So one of the primes must be 2
If we add 2 to each number in the set to find the other prime, we end up with $\{5, 15, 25, 35, \ldots\}$
All of the numbers in the set are divisible by 5, which means the only prime number in the set is 5
So the only number in the set  $\{3,13,23,33, \ldots\}$ that can be written as the difference of two primes is $5-2=3$
The answer is $\boxed{1}$ number.
The area of rectangle $WXYZ$ is $10 \times 6 = 60.$
Since the shaded area is half of the total area of $WXYZ,$ its area is $\frac{1}{2}\times 60=30.$
Since $AD$ and $WX$ are perpendicular, the shaded area has four right angles, so is a rectangle.
Since square $ABCD$ has a side length of $6,$ we have $DC=6.$
Since the shaded area is $30,$ then $PD \times DC=30$ or $PD \times 6 = 30$ or $PD=5.$
Since $AD=6$ and $PD=5,$ we obtain $AP=\boxed{1}.$
Add 3 to each member of the list to get $-30,-25,-20,\ldots,55,60$, and divide by 5 to get $-6$,$-5$,$-4$,$\ldots$, $11$,$12$
Adding 7 to each number in the list gives $1,2,3,\ldots,18,19$, so there are $\boxed{19}$ numbers in the list.
$\sqrt7$ is between 2 and 3
$\sqrt{77}$ is between 8 and 9
So, all the integers between $\sqrt7$ and $\sqrt{77}$ are the integers from 3 to 8, inclusive
This is a total of $\boxed{6}$ integers.
We know that the interior angles of a triangle sum to $180^\circ$, so $50^\circ + 55^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ$
It follows that $x = 75$
Thus, this triangle has angles of $50^\circ$, $55^\circ$, and $75^\circ$
The largest of these three angles is $\boxed{75^\circ}$.
I have $11$ choices for the first book and $10$ choices for the second book, making $11\cdot 10$ pairs
But each pair has been counted twice (once for each ordering of the two books)
Since order doesn't matter, the actual number of pairs I can choose is $(11\cdot 10)/2$, which is $\boxed{55}$.
If $r$ is the radius of the circle, then the circumference is $2\pi r$
Setting $2\pi r$ equal to 18 cm, we find $r=9/\pi$ cm
The area of the circle is $\pi r^2=\pi\left(\dfrac{9}{\pi}\right)^2=\boxed{\dfrac{81}{\pi}}$ square centimeters.
Notice how the parentheses are only around pairs of numbers that are being multiplied or divided
Since multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction, it doesn't matter if we remove the parentheses
That's why  \begin{align*}
&54+(98\div14)+(23\cdot 17)-200-(312\div 6)\\
&=54+98\div14+23\cdot17-200-312\div 6\\
&=\boxed{200}.\end{align*}
The number $4!=24$ has prime factorization $2^33^1$
A factor of 24 must have between zero and three 2's in its prime factorization, and between zero and one 3's in its prime factorization
Therefore, 24 has $(3+1)(1+1)=8$ factors, and the probability that a number randomly chosen from the given set is a factor of 24 is $\frac{8}{24}=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.
If the mean of four numbers is $15$, then the sum of the four numbers is $15\times4=60$
We subtract the two numbers we know to get $60-10-18=32$
So the sum of the two equal numbers is $32$ and their value is $\frac{32}{2}=16$
The product of the two equal numbers is $16\times16=\boxed{256}$.
The question is asking us to divide $\frac{1}{6}\div \frac{1}{3}$
To see this, imagine that the numbers were something nicer, for example: "How many threes are in 12?" We can see that this problem is asking us how many groups of 3 you can make if you have 12 things, and the answer is $12\div 3=4$
So we get\[\frac{1}{6}\div \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{3}{1}=\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1\cdot\cancel{3}}{2\cdot \cancel{3}}=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.\]
Since $\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}$ actually lies on $\ell,$ the reflection takes this vector to itself.
unitsize(1.5 cm);
pair D = (4,-3), V = (2,1), P = (V + reflect((0,0),D)*(V))/2;
draw((4,-3)/2--(-4,3)/2,dashed);
draw((-2,0)--(2,0));
draw((0,-2)--(0,2));
draw((0,0)--P,Arrow(6));
label("$\ell$", (4,-3)/2, SE);

\[\begin{pmatrix} \frac{7}{25} & -\frac{24}{25} \\ -\frac{24}{25} & -\frac{7}{25} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}.\]This gives us
\[\begin{pmatrix} \frac{7}{25} a - \frac{24}{25} b \\ -\frac{24}{25} a - \frac{7}{25} b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}.\]Then $\frac{7}{25} a - \frac{24}{25} b = a$ and $-\frac{24}{25} a - \frac{7}{25} b = b.$  Either equation reduces to $b = -\frac{3}{4} a,$ so the vector we seek is $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}}.$

Then $\overrightarrow{AP}$ is a multiple of the normal vector of the plane, which is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -4 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.$  Thus,
\[\overrightarrow{AP} = t \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -4 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\]for some scalar $t.$ This means point $P$ is of the form $(1 + 3t, 2 - 4t, 3 + 5t).$  But we also know $P$ lies in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30,$ so
\[3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30.\]Solving for $t,$ we find $t = \frac{2}{5}.$  Therefore, $P = \boxed{\left( \frac{11}{5}, \frac{2}{5}, 5 \right)}.$
Note that $(0,5)$ and $(1,2)$ are two points on the line, so the line has a direction vector of

The vector going from $(0,5)$ to $(-4,-2)$ is $\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix}.$  Projecting this vector onto the direction vector, we get

The matrix that projects onto $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is
\[\begin{pmatrix} \frac{9}{10} & \frac{3}{10} \\ \frac{3}{10} & \frac{1}{10} \end{pmatrix},\]and the matrix that projects onto $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is

Since the point lies in the $xz$-plane, it is of the form $(x,0,z).$  We want this point to be equidistant to the points $(1,-1,0),$ $(2,1,2),$ and $(3,2,-1),$ which gives us the equations
\begin{align*}
(x - 1)^2 + 1^2 + z^2 &= (x - 2)^2 + 1^2 + (z - 2)^2, \\
(x - 1)^2 + 1^2 + z^2 &= (x - 3)^2 + 2^2 + (z + 1)^2.
\end{align*}These equations simplify to $2x + 4z = 7$ and $4x - 2z = 12.$  Solving these equation, we find $x = \frac{31}{10}$ and $z = \frac{1}{5},$ so the point we seek is $\boxed{\left( \frac{31}{10}, 0, \frac{1}{5} \right)}.$
The direction vector of the first line is $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix},$ and the direction vector of the second line is $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  Since these vectors are not parallel, the two lines are skew if and only if they do not intersect.
Suppose the two lines intersect
Equating the vectors for the two lines, and comparing components, we obtain the system of equations
\begin{align*}
1 + 2t &= 4 + 5u, \\
2 + 3t &= 1 + 2u, \\
a + 4t &= u.
\end{align*}Solving, we find $t = -1,$ $u = -1,$ and $a = 3.$
Therefore, the two lines are skew for $a \neq 3,$ or $a \in \boxed{(-\infty,3) \cup (3,\infty)}.$
Since $0 \le x,$ $y \le \pi,$ $\sin x \ge 0,$ $\sin y \ge 0,$ $\cos x \le 1,$ and $\cos y \le 1,$ so from the angle addition formula,
\[\sin (x + y) = \sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y \le \sin x + \sin y.\]Thus, the given condition holds for all $y \in \boxed{[0,\pi]}.$
From the formula for the inverse,
\[\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad + 2} \begin{pmatrix} d & -1 \\ 2 & a \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{d}{ad + 2} & -\frac{1}{ad + 2} \\ \frac{2}{ad + 2} & \frac{a}{ad + 2} \end{pmatrix},\]so we want
\[\begin{pmatrix} a & 1 \\ -2 & d \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \frac{d}{ad + 2} & -\frac{1}{ad + 2} \\ \frac{2}{ad + 2} & \frac{a}{ad + 2} \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{0}.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
a + \frac{d}{ad + 2} &= 0, \\
1 - \frac{1}{ad + 2} &= 0, \\
-2 + \frac{2}{ad + 2} &= 0, \\
d + \frac{a}{ad + 2} & =0.
\end{align*}From the equation $1 - \frac{1}{ad + 2} = 0,$ $ad + 2 = 1,$ so $ad = -1.$  Then
\[\det \mathbf{A} = \det \begin{pmatrix} a & 1 \\ -2 & d \end{pmatrix} = ad + 2 = \boxed{1}.\]Note that $a = 1$ and $d = -1$ satisfy the given conditions.
More generally,
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & b \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & a + b \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.\]Therefore,
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 5 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \dotsm \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 99 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + 99 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2500 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}}.\]

Since $A = 2 \alpha,$
\[\tan A = \tan 2 \alpha = \frac{2 \tan \alpha}{1 - \tan^2 \alpha} = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2}}}{1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{4}}} = \frac{2^{4/3}}{2^{2/3} - 1}.\]Now, since $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BC},$
\[\tan \angle CAM = \frac{1}{2} \tan A = \frac{2^{1/3}}{2^{2/3} - 1}.\]Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\tan \theta &= \tan \angle DAM \\
&= \tan (\angle CAM - \angle CAD) \\
&= \frac{\tan \angle CAM - \tan \angle CAD}{1 + \tan \angle CAM \cdot \tan \angle CAD} \\
&= \frac{\frac{2^{1/3}}{2^{2/3} - 1} - \frac{1}{2^{1/3}}}{1 + \frac{2^{1/3}}{2^{2/3} - 1} \cdot \frac{1}{2^{1/3}}} \\
&= \frac{2^{2/3} - (2^{2/3} - 1)}{2^{1/3} \cdot (2^{2/3 - 1} - 1) + 2^{1/3}} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.
\end{align*}
Expanding, we get
\[\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \left( \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 11 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} x - 1 \\ y - 11 \end{pmatrix} = (-2)(x - 1) + (-5)(y - 11) = 0.\]Solving for $y,$ we find
\[y = -\frac{2}{5} x + \frac{57}{5}.\]Thus, $(m,b) = \boxed{\left( -\frac{2}{5}, \frac{57}{5} \right)}.$
From the first equation,
\[\frac{\sin x \cos x + \sin y \cos y}{\cos x \cos y} = 1.\]From the second equation,
\[\frac{\cos x \sin x + \cos y \sin y}{\sin x \sin y} = 6.\]Dividing these equations, we get
\[\tan x \tan y = \frac{1}{6}.\]Multiplying the two given equations, we get
\[\frac{\sin x \cos x}{\sin y \cos y} + 1 + 1 + \frac{\sin y \cos y}{\sin x \cos x} = 6,\]so
\[\frac{\sin x \cos x}{\sin y \cos y} + \frac{\sin y \cos y}{\sin x \cos x} = 4.\]Note that
\begin{align*}
\sin x \cos x &= \frac{\sin x \cos x}{\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x} \\
&= \frac{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}}{\frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x} + 1} \\
&= \frac{\tan x}{\tan^2 x + 1}.
\end{align*}Similarly, $\sin y \cos y = \frac{\tan y}{\tan^2 y + 1},$ so
\[\frac{\tan x (\tan^2 y + 1)}{\tan y (\tan^2 x + 1)} + \frac{\tan y (\tan^2 x + 1)}{\tan x (\tan^2 y + 1)} = 4.\]Then
\[\frac{\tan x \tan^2 y + \tan x}{\tan y \tan^2 x + \tan y} + \frac{\tan y \tan^2 x + \tan y}{\tan x \tan^2 y + \tan x} = 4.\]Since $\tan x \tan y = \frac{1}{6},$
\[\frac{\frac{1}{6} \tan y + \tan x}{\frac{1}{6} \tan x + \tan y} + \frac{\frac{1}{6} \tan x + \tan y}{\frac{1}{6} \tan y + \tan x} = 4.\]Thus,
\[\frac{\tan y + 6 \tan x}{\tan x + 6 \tan y} + \frac{\tan x + 6 \tan y}{\tan y + 6 \tan x} = 4.\]Then
\[(\tan y + 6 \tan x)^2 + (\tan x + 6 \tan y)^2 = 4 (\tan x + 6 \tan y)(\tan y + 6 \tan x),\]or
\begin{align*}
&\tan^2 y + 12 \tan x \tan y + 36 \tan^2 x + \tan^2 x + 12 \tan x \tan y + 36 \tan^2 y \\
&= 4 \tan x \tan y + 24 \tan^2 x + 24 \tan^2 y + 144 \tan x \tan y.
\end{align*}This reduces to
\[13 \tan^2 x + 13 \tan^2 y = 124 \tan x \tan y = \frac{124}{6},\]so $\tan^2 x + \tan^2 y = \frac{62}{39}.$
Finally,
\[\frac{\tan x}{\tan y} + \frac{\tan y}{\tan x} = \frac{\tan^2 x + \tan^2 y}{\tan x \tan y} = \frac{\frac{62}{39}}{\frac{1}{6}} = \boxed{\frac{124}{13}}.\]
Let $\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix}.$  Then
\[\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} pa + qc & pb + qd \\ ra + sc & rb + sd \end{pmatrix}.\]We want this to be equal to $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 3c & 3d \end{pmatrix}.$  We can achieve this by taking $p = 1,$ $q = 0,$ $r = 0,$ and $s = 3,$ so $\mathbf{M} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix}}.$
Since the projection of $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$ is $\begin{pmatrix} \frac{60}{13} \\ \frac{12}{13} \end{pmatrix},$ the vector being projected onto is a scalar multiple of $\begin{pmatrix} \frac{60}{13} \\ \frac{12}{13} \end{pmatrix}.$  Thus, we can assume that the vector being projected onto is $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$

Thus, the projection of $\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$ is

Note that
\[\mathbf{A}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}.\]Then
\[\mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{A}^2 \mathbf{A}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.\]Since $\mathbf{A}^4$ is a diagonal matrix, any power of $\mathbf{A}^4$ is
\begin{align*}
(\mathbf{A}^4)^{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 0^k & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1^k & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1^k \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{A}^4.
\end{align*}Hence,
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^{95} &= (\mathbf{A}^4)^{23} \mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{A}^4 \mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^2 \\

&= \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}}

We have that $r = \sqrt{(-5)^2 + 0^2} = 5.$  We want $\theta$ to satisfy
\begin{align*}
-5 &= 5 \cos \theta, \\
0 &= 5 \sin \theta.
\end{align*}Thus, $\theta = \pi,$ so the cylindrical coordinates are $\boxed{(5,\pi,-8)}.$
Let the side lengths be $n,$ $n + 1,$ $n + 2.$  Then the smallest angle $x$ is opposite the side of length $n,$ and its cosine is
\[\cos x = \frac{(n + 1)^2 + (n + 2)^2 - n^2}{2(n + 1)(n + 2)} = \frac{n^2 + 6n + 5}{2(n + 1)(n + 2)} = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 5)}{2(n + 1)(n + 2)} = \frac{n + 5}{2(n + 2)}.\]The largest angle $y$ is opposite the side of length $n + 2,$ and its cosine is
\[\cos y = \frac{n^2 + (n + 1)^2 - (n + 2)^2}{2n(n + 1)} = \frac{n^2 - 2n - 3}{2n(n + 1)} = \frac{(n + 1)(n - 3)}{2n(n + 1)} = \frac{n - 3}{2n}.\]Since $y = 2x,$
\[\cos y = \cos 2x = 2 \cos^2 x - 1.\]Thus,
\[\frac{n - 3}{2n} = 2 \left( \frac{n + 5}{2(n + 2)} \right)^2 - 1.\]This simplifies to $2n^3 - n^2 - 25n - 12 = 0.$  This equation factors as $(n - 4)(n + 3)(2n + 1) = 0,$ so $n = 4.$
Then the cosine of the smallest angle is $\cos x = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.$
We have that

Let $p_k$ denote the complex number corresponding to the point $P_k,$ for $1 \le k \le 10.$  Since the $P_k$ form a regular decagon centered at 2, the $p_k$ are the roots of

This occurs exactly when $4x^3 y - 4xy^3 = 4xy(x^2 - y^2) = 0,$ so either $x = 0,$ $y = 0,$ $x = y,$ or $x = -y.$  In other words, $\cos a \pi = 0,$ $\sin b \pi = 0,$ $\cos a \pi = \sin b \pi,$ or $\cos a \pi = -\sin b \pi.$
If $\cos a \pi = 0,$ then $a = \frac{1}{2}$ or $a = \frac{3}{2},$ and $b$ can be any value in $S.$  This gives us 40 pairs $(a,b).$
If $\sin b \pi = 0,$ then $b = 0$ or $b = 1,$ and $a$ can be any value in $S.$  This gives us 40 pairs $(a,b),$ but the four pairs $\left( \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right),$ $\left( \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right),$ $\left( \frac{3}{2}, 0 \right),$ and $\left( \frac{3}{2}, 1 \right)$ have already been counted, so it gives us only 36 additional pairs.
If $\cos a \pi = \sin b \pi,$ then
\[\cos a \pi = \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - b \pi \right),\]which implies $a \pi - \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - b \pi \right) = 2 \pi k$ for some integer $k,$ or $a \pi + \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - b \pi \right) = 2 \pi k'$ for some integer $k'.$  These lead to $a + b - \frac{1}{2} = 2k$ or $a - b + \frac{1}{2} = 2k'.$  We have already counted the pairs where $b = 0$ or $b = 1,$ so we exclude these values
We can check that if the denominator of $b$ is 3 or 5, then there are no possible values of $a.$
If $b = \frac{1}{2},$ then $a = 0$ for either equation
If $b = \frac{3}{2},$ then $a = 1$ for either equation
Finally, we can check that if $b \in \left\{ \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{4}, \frac{7}{4} \right\},$ then there is exactly one solution for $a$ for the equation $a + b - \frac{1}{2} = 2k$ (which lies in $\left\{ \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{4}, \frac{7}{4} \right\}$), and one solution for $a$ for the equation $a - b + \frac{1}{2} = 2k'$ (which lies in $\left\{ \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{4}, \frac{7}{4} \right\}$)
Furthermore, if $a + b - \frac{1}{2} = 2k$ and $a - b + \frac{1}{2} = 2k',$ then subtracting these equations, we get
\[2b - 1 = 2k - 2k',\]so $b = k - k' + \frac{1}{2}.$  Thus, $b = \frac{1}{2}$ or $b = \frac{3}{2},$ and we count these values just once
This gives us $2 + 8 = 10$ pairs $(a,b).$
Similarly, if $\cos a \pi = -\sin b \pi,$ then
\[\cos a \pi = -\sin b \pi = \sin (-b \pi) = \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} + b \pi \right),\]which implies $a \pi - \left( \frac{\pi}{2} + b \pi \right) = 2 \pi k$ for some integer $k,$ or $a \pi + \left( \frac{\pi}{2} + b \pi \right) = 2 \pi k'$ for some integer $k'.$  These lead to $a - b - \frac{1}{2} = 2k$ or $a + b + \frac{1}{2} = 2k'.$  We have already counted the pairs where $b = 0$ or $b = 1,$ so we exclude these values
We can check that if the denominator of $b$ is 3 or 5, then there are no possible values of $a.$
If $b = \frac{1}{2},$ then $a = 1$ for either equation
If $b = \frac{3}{2},$ then $a = 0$ for either equation
Finally, we can check that if $b \in \left\{ \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{4}, \frac{7}{4} \right\},$ then there is exactly one solution for $a$ for the equation $a - b - \frac{1}{2} = 2k$ (which lies in $\left\{ \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{4}, \frac{7}{4} \right\}$), and one solution for $a$ for the equation $a + b + \frac{1}{2} = 2k'$ (which lies in $\left\{ \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{4}, \frac{7}{4} \right\}$)
Furthermore, if $a - b - \frac{1}{2} = 2k$ and $a + b + \frac{1}{2} = 2k',$ then subtracting these equations, we get
\[2b + 1 = 2k' - 2k,\]so $b = k' - k - \frac{1}{2}.$  Thus, $b = \frac{1}{2}$ or $b = \frac{3}{2},$ and we count these values just once
We can also confirm that all of the pairs in this case are different from the pairs in the previous case
This gives us $2 + 8 = 10$ pairs $(a,b).$
Thus, there are a total of $40 + 36 + 10 + 10 = 96$ possible pairs $(a,b).$  There are $20^2 = 400$ ways to choose the pair $(a,b),$ which gives us a probability of $\frac{96}{400} = \boxed{\frac{6}{25}}.$
Define the sequence $(\theta_n)$ by $\theta_0 = \arccos \frac{5}{13}$ and
\[\theta_n = 2 \theta_{n - 1}.\]Then $\cos \theta_0 = \frac{5}{13},$ and
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta_n &= \cos (2 \theta_{n - 1}) \\
&= 2 \cos^2 \theta_{n - 1} - 1.
\end{align*}Since the sequences $(a_n)$ and $(\cos \theta_n)$ have the same initial term, and the same recursion, they coincide.
We have that
\[\sin^2 \theta_0 = 1 - \cos^2 \theta_0 = \frac{144}{169}.\]Since $\theta_0$ is acute, $\sin \theta_0 = \frac{12}{13}.$
\begin{align*}
a_0 a_1 \dotsm a_{n - 1} &= \cos \theta_0 \cos \theta_1 \dotsm \cos \theta_{n - 1} \\
&= \cos \theta_0 \cos 2 \theta_0 \dotsm \cos 2^{n - 1} \theta_0.
\end{align*}Multiplying both sides by $\sin \theta_0 = \frac{12}{13},$ we get
\begin{align*}
\frac{12}{13} a_0 a_1 \dotsm a_{n - 1} &= \sin \theta_0 \cos \theta_0 \cos 2 \theta_0 \cos 4 \theta_0 \dotsm \cos 2^{n - 1} \theta_0 \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \sin 2 \theta_0 \cos 2 \theta_0 \cos 4 \theta_0 \dotsm \cos 2^{n - 1} \theta_0 \\
&= \frac{1}{4} \sin 4 \theta_0 \dotsm \cos 2^{n - 1} \theta_0 \\
&= \dotsb \\
&= \frac{1}{2^n} \sin 2^n \theta_0.
\end{align*}Hence,
\[|a_0 a_2 \dotsm a_{n - 1}| = \frac{1}{2^n} \cdot \frac{13}{12} |\sin 2^n \theta_0| \le \frac{1}{2^n} \cdot \frac{13}{12}.\]This tells us $c \le \frac{13}{12}.$
We can compute that $a_1 = 2a_0^2 - 1 = 2 \left( \frac{5}{13} \right)^2 - 1 = -\frac{119}{169},$ so
\[\frac{5}{13} \cdot \frac{119}{169} \le \frac{c}{4}.\]Then $c \ge \frac{2380}{2197}.$  The bound
\[\frac{2380}{2197} \le c \le \frac{13}{12}\]tells us that the integer closest to $100c$ is $\boxed{108}.$
Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}.$  Since $\mathbf{v}$ is a unit vector, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1.$
Since the angle between $\mathbf{v}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ is $45^\circ,$
\[\frac{2x + 2y - z}{\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \cos 45^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.\]Then $2x + 2y - z = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}.$
Since the angle between $\mathbf{v}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ is $60^\circ,$
\[\frac{y - z}{\sqrt{0^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2}} = \cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}.\]Then $y - z = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.$
Hence, $y = z + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.$  From the equation $2x + 2y - z = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}},$
\begin{align*}
x &= -y + \frac{z}{2} + \frac{3}{2 \sqrt{2}} \\
&= -\left( z + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \frac{z}{2} + \frac{3}{2 \sqrt{2}} \\
&= -\frac{z}{2} + \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}}.
\end{align*}Substituting into the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1,$ we get
\[\left( -\frac{z}{2} + \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}} \right)^2 + \left( z + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 + z^2 = 1.\]This simplifies to $6z^2 + 2z \sqrt{2} - 1 = 0.$  The solutions are $z = \frac{1}{3 \sqrt{2}}$ and $z = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.$  The possible vectors $\mathbf{v}$ are then
\[\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{3 \sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{4}{3 \sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{3 \sqrt{2}} \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{pmatrix},\]and the distance between these vectors is $\boxed{\sqrt{2}}.$
Since a rotation around $c$ fixes $c$, the complex number $c$ must satisfy $f(c) = c$
In other words,
\[c = \frac{(-1 + i \sqrt{3}) c + (-2 \sqrt{3} - 18i)}{2}\]Then $2c = (-1 + i \sqrt{3}) c + (-2 \sqrt{3} - 18i)$, so
\[(3 - i \sqrt{3}) c = -2 \sqrt{3} - 18i.\]Then
\begin{align*}
c &= \frac{-2 \sqrt{3} - 18i}{3 - i \sqrt{3}} \\
&= \frac{(-2 \sqrt{3} - 18i)(3 + i \sqrt{3})}{(3 - i \sqrt{3})(3 + i \sqrt{3})} \\
&= \frac{-6 \sqrt{3} - 6i - 54i + 18 \sqrt{3}}{12} \\
&= \frac{12 \sqrt{3} - 60i}{12} \\
&= \boxed{\sqrt{3} - 5i}.
\end{align*}
The determinant of the matrix is given by the scalar triple product
\[\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -7 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.\]In turn, this is equal to
\[\mathbf{u} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -7 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \|\mathbf{u}\| \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -7 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \cos \theta = \sqrt{59} \cos \theta,\]where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{u}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -7 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.$
Hence, the maximum value of the determinant is $\boxed{\sqrt{59}},$ and this is achieved when $\mathbf{u}$ is the unit vector pointing in the direction of $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -7 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.$
We see that
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 7t \\ -5t \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 7t + 2 \\ -5t \end{pmatrix}\]and
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + s \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -2s \\ 3s \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 - 2s \\ -1 + 3s \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, we want $s$ and $t$ to satisfy the system of equations
\begin{align*}
7t + 2 &= 1 - 2s, \\
-5t &= -1 + 3s.
\end{align*}Solving, we find $(t,s) = \boxed{\left( -\frac{5}{11}, \frac{12}{11} \right)}.$
Note that $\cos^2 \theta = 1$ if and only if $\theta$ is a multiple of $180^\circ.$  Thus, we seek $k$ so that
\[k^2 + 36 = 180n\]for some nonnegative integer $n.$  Then
\[k^2 = 180n - 36 = 36 (5n - 1).\]Hence, $k$ must be a multiple of 6
We see that $k = 6$ does not work, but $k = \boxed{12}$ and $k = \boxed{18}$ work, so these are the two smallest solutions.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$, let $AM = 2a$, and let $\theta =\angle AMB$
Then $\cos \angle AMC = -\cos \theta.$ Applying the Law of Cosines to triangles $ABM$ and $AMC$ yields, respectively, $$
a^2+4a^2-4a^2\cos \theta = 1
$$and $$
a^2+4a^2+4a^2\cos \theta = 4.
$$Adding, we obtain $10a^2 = 5$, so $a=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $BC = 2a = \boxed{\sqrt{2}}$.

We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} \cos \alpha \cos \beta & \cos \alpha \sin \beta & -\sin \alpha \\ -\sin \beta & \cos \beta & 0 \\ \sin \alpha \cos \beta & \sin \alpha \sin \beta & \cos \alpha \end{vmatrix} &= \cos \alpha \cos \beta \begin{vmatrix} \cos \beta & 0 \\ \sin \alpha \sin \beta & \cos \alpha \end{vmatrix} \\
&\quad - \cos \alpha \sin \beta \begin{vmatrix} -\sin \beta & 0 \\ \sin \alpha \cos \beta & \cos \alpha \end{vmatrix} - \sin \alpha \begin{vmatrix} -\sin \beta & \cos \beta \\ \sin \alpha \cos \beta & \sin \alpha \sin \beta \end{vmatrix} \\
&= \cos \alpha \cos \beta (\cos \beta \cos \alpha) - \cos \alpha \sin \beta (-\sin \beta \cos \alpha) \\
&\quad - \sin \alpha ((-\sin \beta)(\sin \alpha \sin \beta) - (\cos \beta)(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)) \\
&= \cos^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta + \cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta + \sin^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta + \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta \\
&= (\cos^2 \alpha + \sin^2 \alpha)(\cos^2 \beta + \sin^2 \beta) \\
&= \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} y + 1 & y & y \\ y & y + 1 & y \\ y & y & y + 1 \end{vmatrix} &= (y + 1)\begin{vmatrix} y + 1 & y \\ y & y + 1 \end{vmatrix} - y \begin{vmatrix} y & y \\ y & y + 1 \end{vmatrix} + y \begin{vmatrix} y & y + 1 \\ y & y \end{vmatrix} \\
&= (y + 1)((y + 1)(y + 1) - y^2) - y(y(y + 1) - y^2) + y(y^2 - y(y + 1)) \\
&= \boxed{3y + 1}.
\end{align*}
If $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors, then
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \left\| \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} = \frac{(2)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(0)}{\sqrt{6} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{-3}{2 \sqrt{3}} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.\]Hence, $\theta = \boxed{150^\circ}.$
Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}.$

Then by the properties of projections,
\[\left( \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} \frac{38}{5} \\ \frac{19}{5} \end{pmatrix} \right) \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = 0,\]and
\[\left( \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} \frac{58}{13} \\ \frac{87}{13} \end{pmatrix} \right) \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 0.\]These lead to the equations
\[2 \left( x - \frac{38}{5} \right) + \left( y - \frac{19}{5} \right) = 0\]and
\[2 \left( x - \frac{58}{13} \right) + 3 \left( y - \frac{87}{13} \right) = 0.\]Solving, we find $x = 7$ and $y = 5,$ so $\mathbf{v} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}}.$
Note that we're rotating $ABCD$ by $45^\circ$ and scaling by $\sqrt 2$ so that
\mathbf M = \sqrt 2\begin{pmatrix}
\cos 45^\circ & -\sin 45^\circ \\
\sin 45^\circ & \phantom -\cos 45^\circ
\end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 1 & \phantom -1 \end{pmatrix}}.
$$Alternatively, we note that $\mathbf M \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf M \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$ Since $\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ determine the first and second columns of $\mathbf M,$ respectively, we know this is our answer.
We can write the equations of the planes as $x + 2y + 3z - 2 = 0$ and $x - y + z - 3 = 0.$  Any point in $L$ satisfies both equations, which means any point in $L$ satisfies an equation of the form
\[a(x + 2y + 3z - 2) + b(x - y + z - 3) = 0.\]We can write this as
\[(a + b)x + (2a - b)y + (3a + b)z - (2a + 3b) = 0.\]The distance from this plane to $(3,1,-1)$ is $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}.$  Using the formula for the distance from a point to a plane, we get
\[\frac{|(a + b)(3) + (2a - b)(1) + (3a + b)(-1) - (2a + 3b)|}{\sqrt{(a + b)^2 + (2a - b)^2 + (3a + b)^2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}.\]We can simplify this to
\[\frac{|2b|}{\sqrt{14a^2 + 4ab + 3b^2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}.\]Then $|b| \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{14a^2 + 4ab + 3b^2}.$  Squaring both sides, we get $3b^2 = 14a^2 + 4ab + 3b^2,$ so
\[14a^2 + 4ab = 0.\]This factors as $2a(7a + 2b) = 0.$  If $a = 0,$ then plane $P$ will coincide with the second plane $x - y + z = 3.$  So, $7a + 2b = 0.$  We can take $a = 2$ and $b = -7,$ which gives us
\[(2)(x + 2y + 3z - 2) + (-7)(x - y + z - 3) = 0.\]This simplifies to $\boxed{5x - 11y + z - 17 = 0}.$
The only way that the sum of a cosine and a sine can equal 2 is if each is equal to 1, so
\[\cos (2A - B) = \sin (A + B) = 1.\]Since $A + B = 180^\circ,$ $0 < A + B < 180^\circ.$  Then we must have
\[A + B = 90^\circ.\]This means $A < 90^\circ$ and $B < 90^\circ,$ so $2A - B < 180^\circ$ and $2A - B > -90^\circ.$  Hence,
\[2A - B = 0^\circ.\]Solving the equations $A + B = 90^\circ$ and $2A = B,$ we find $A = 30^\circ$ and $B = 60^\circ.$

Therefore, triangle $ABC$ is a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle, so $BC = \frac{AB}{2} = \boxed{2}.$
Let $A = (3,-5),$ $B = (-2,0),$ and $C = (1,-6).$  Let $\mathbf{v} = \overrightarrow{CA} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 - 1 \\  -5 - (-6) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{w} = \overrightarrow{CB} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 - 1 \\ 0 - (-6) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.$  The area of triangle $ABC$ is half the area of the parallelogram determined by $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}.$

The area of the parallelogram determined by $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ is
\[|(2)(6) - (-3)(1)| = 15,\]so the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\boxed{\frac{15}{2}}.$
From the addition formula for tangent,
\[\tan (A + B + C) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B + \tan C - \tan A \tan B \tan C}{1 - (\tan A \tan B + \tan A \tan C + \tan B \tan C)}.\]Since $A + B + C = 180^\circ,$ this is 0
Hence,
\[\tan A + \tan B + \tan C = \tan A \tan B \tan C.\]From $\cot A \cot C = \frac{1}{2},$ $\tan A \tan C = 2.$  Also, from $\cot B \cot C = \frac{1}{18},$ $\tan B \tan C = 18.$
Let $x = \tan C.$  Then $\tan A = \frac{2}{x}$ and $\tan B = \frac{18}{x},$ so
\[\frac{2}{x} + \frac{18}{x} + x = \frac{2}{x} \cdot \frac{18}{x} \cdot x.\]This simplifies to $20 + x^2 = 36.$  Then $x^2 = 16,$ so $x = \pm 4.$
If $x = -4,$ then $\tan A,$ $\tan B,$ $\tan C$ would all be negative
This is impossible, because a triangle must have at least one acute angle, so $x = \boxed{4}.$
From $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B},$
\[\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B} - \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{0}.\]Then $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B} - \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{I}.$  In the style of Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we can write this as
\[(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I})(\mathbf{B} - \mathbf{I}) = \mathbf{I}.\]Thus, $\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}$ and $\mathbf{B} - \mathbf{I}$ are inverses, so
\[(\mathbf{B} - \mathbf{I})(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) = \mathbf{I}.\]Then $\mathbf{B} \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{I},$ so
\[\mathbf{B} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{B} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 20/3 & 4/3 \\ -8/3 & 8/3 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We have that
\begin{align*}
-5 &= \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta, \\
-7 &= \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta, \\
4 &= \rho \cos \phi.
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
\rho \sin (-\phi) \cos \theta &= -\rho \sin \phi \cos \theta = 5, \\
\rho \sin (-\phi) \sin \theta &= -\rho \sin \phi \sin \theta = 7, \\
\rho \cos (-\phi) &= \rho \cos \phi = 4.
\end{align*}so the rectangular coordinates are $\boxed{(5,7,4)}.$
Performing the multiplication on both sides, we obtain
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3a & 3b \\ 2c & 2d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 18a - 20b & 12a - 13b \\ 18c - 20d & 12c - 13d \end{pmatrix}.\]Hence, $3a = 18a - 20b,$ $12a - 13b = 3b,$ $18c - 20d = 2c,$ and $12c - 13d = 2d.$  Then $15a = 20b,$ $12a = 16b,$ $16c = 20d,$ and $12c = 15d.$  These reduce to $3a = 4b$ and $4c = 5d.$  The smallest positive integer solutions are $a = 4,$ $b = 3,$ $c = 5,$ and $d = 4,$ so the smallest possible value of $a + b + c + d$ is $4 + 3 + 5 + 4 = \boxed{16}.$
By the quadratic formula,
\[\tan x = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{77}}{2}.\]Let $r_1 = \frac{9 + \sqrt{77}}{2}$ and $r_2 = \frac{9 - \sqrt{77}}{2}.$  Note that $r_1 r_2 = 1.$
Graphing $y = \tan x,$ we see that $\tan x = r_1$ for two angles in $[0,2 \pi],$ and $\tan x = r_2$ for two angles in $[0,2 \pi].$

Let $\alpha = \arctan r_1,$ and let $\beta = \arctan r_2,$ which are two of the solutions
Note that
\[\tan \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \alpha \right) = \frac{\sin (\frac{\pi}{2} - \alpha)}{\cos (\frac{\pi}{2} - \alpha)} = \frac{\cos \alpha}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{1}{\tan \alpha} = \frac{1}{r_1} = r_2.\]It follows that $\beta = \frac{\pi}{2} - \alpha,$ or
\[\alpha + \beta = \frac{\pi}{2}.\]The other two solutions are $\alpha + \pi$ and $\beta + \pi.$  Hence, the sum of all four solutions is
\[\alpha + \beta + \alpha + \pi + \beta + \pi = 2 \alpha + 2 \beta + 2 \pi = \boxed{3 \pi}.\]
By the Law of Cosines,
\[a^2 = 5^2 + 4^2 - 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cos A = 41 - 40 \cos A.\]In general, $\cos (B - C) - \cos (B + C) = 2 \sin B \sin C.$  We know $\cos (B - C) = \frac{31}{32}$ and
\[\cos (B + C) = \cos (180^\circ - A) = -\cos A.\]By the Law of Sines,
\[\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C},\]so $\sin B = \frac{5 \sin A}{a}$ and $\sin C = \frac{4 \sin A}{a}.$  Hence,
\[\frac{31}{32} + \cos A = \frac{40 \sin^2 A}{a^2}.\]Then
\[\frac{31}{32} + \cos A = \frac{40 (1 - \cos^2 A)}{41 - 40 \cos A}.\]This simplifies to $\cos A = \frac{1}{8}.$  Then
\[a^2 = 41 - 40 \cos A = 36,\]so $a = \boxed{6}.$
The only real roots of unity are 1 and $-1$
If $\omega$ is a nonreal root of unity that is also a root of the equation $z^2 + az + b$, then its conjugate $\overline{\omega}$ must also be a root
\[|a| = |\omega + \overline{\omega}| \le |\omega| + |\overline{\omega}| = 2\]and $b = \omega \overline{\omega} = |\omega|^2 = 1.$
So we only need to check the quadratic equations of the form $z^2 + az + 1 = 0,$ where $-2 \le a \le 2.$  This gives us the following $\boxed{8}$ roots of unity: $\pm 1,$ $\pm i,$ and $\pm \frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i.$

As usual, let $a = BC,$ $b = AC,$ and $c = AB.$  From right triangle $AFC,$ $AF = b \cos A.$  By the Extended Law of Sines, $b = 2R \sin B,$ so
\[AF = 2R \cos A \sin B.\]From right triangle $ADB,$ $\angle DAB = 90^\circ - B.$  Then $\angle AHF = B,$ so
\[HF = \frac{AF}{\tan B} = \frac{2R \cos A \sin B}{\sin B/\cos B} = 2R \cos A \cos B = 6.\]Also from right triangle $AFC,$
\[CF = b \sin A = 2R \sin A \sin B = 21.\]Therefore,
\[\tan A \tan B = \frac{2R \sin A \sin B}{2R \cos A \cos B} = \frac{21}{6} = \boxed{\frac{7}{2}}.\]
Squaring the equation, we get
\[\cos^2 \theta + 2 \cos \theta \sin \theta + \sin^2 \theta = \frac{25}{16}.\]Then $\sin 2 \theta + 1 = \frac{25}{16},$ so $\sin 2 \theta = \boxed{\frac{9}{16}}.$
Let $x = \arccos \frac{1}{3},$ so $\cos x = \frac{1}{3}.$  From the triple angle formula,
\[\cos 3x = 4 \cos^3 x - 3 \cos x = 4 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 - 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = -\frac{23}{27}.\]Then from the double angle formula,
\[\cos 6x = 2 \cos^2 3x - 1 = 2 \left( -\frac{23}{27} \right)^2 - 1 = \boxed{\frac{329}{729}}.\]
For the part where the function is positive, the minimum value is 2
The minimum value of $y = a \csc bx,$ where $y$ is positive, is $a.$  Therefore, $a = \boxed{2}.$
Recall that
\[\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,\]where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}.$  Hence,
\[8 = 2 \cdot 5 \cdot \sin \theta,\]so $\sin \theta = \frac{4}{5}.$  Then
\[\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta = \frac{9}{25},\]so $\cos \theta = \pm \frac{3}{5}.$  Hence,
\[|\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| |\cos \theta| = 2 \cdot 5 \cdot \frac{3}{5} = \boxed{6}.\]
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$
We can re-write the given equation as $\frac{1}{\cos x} + \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{4}{3},$ so
\[3 + 3 \sin x = 4 \cos x.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[9 + 18 \sin x + 9 \sin^2 x = 16 \cos^2 x = 16 (1 - \sin^2 x).\]Then $25 \sin^2 x + 18 \sin x - 7 = 0,$ which factors as $(\sin x + 1)(25 \sin x - 7) = 0.$  Hence, $\sin x = -1$ or $\sin x = \frac{7}{25}.$
If $\sin x = -1,$ then $\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x = 0,$ so $\cos x = 0.$  But this makes $\sec x$ and $\tan x$ undefined
So the only possible value of $\sin x$ is $\boxed{\frac{7}{25}}.$
Note that the magnitude of the vector $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$ is $\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2}$ is 3
Furthermore, if this vector makes an angle of $\theta$ with the positive $x$-axis, then
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \left\|\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} = \frac{1}{3}.\]This tells us that $\theta$ is acute, so the vector passes through the positive $x$-axis at $(3,0,0).$

Let the resulting vector be $(x,y,z).$  By symmetry, $y = z.$  Also, since the magnitude of the vector is preserved,
\[x^2 + 2y^2 = 9.\]Also, since the vector is rotated by $90^\circ,$ the resulting vector is orthogonal to the original vector
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ y \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = 0,\]which gives us $x + 4y = 0.$  Then $x = -4y.$  Substituting into $x^2 + 2y^2 = 9,$ we get
\[16y^2 + 2y^2 = 9,\]so $y^2 = \frac{1}{2}.$  Hence, $y = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ so $x = -4y = \mp 2 \sqrt{2}.$  From the geometry of the diagram, $x$ is positive and $y$ and $z$ are negative, so $x = 2 \sqrt{2}.$  Then $y = z = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ so the resulting vector is
\[\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \sqrt{2} \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We can write
\begin{align*}
\frac{\cos x}{1 + \sin x} + \frac{1 + \sin x}{\cos x} &= \frac{\cos^2 x + (1 + \sin x)^2}{(1 + \sin x) \cos x} \\
&= \frac{\cos^2 x + 1 + 2 \sin x + \sin^2 x}{(1 + \sin x) \cos x} \\
&= \frac{2 + 2 \sin x}{(1 + \sin x) \cos x} \\
&= \frac{2 (1 + \sin x)}{(1 + \sin x) \cos x} \\
&= \frac{2}{\cos x} = \boxed{2 \sec x}.
\end{align*}
Let $\omega = e^{2 \pi i/13}.$  Then from the formula for a geometric sequence,
\begin{align*}
e^{2 \pi i/13} + e^{4 \pi i/13} + e^{6 \pi i/13} + \dots + e^{24 \pi i/13} &= \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 + \dots + \omega^{12} \\
&= \omega (1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \dots + \omega^{11}) \\
&= \omega \cdot \frac{1 - \omega^{12}}{1 - \omega} \\
&= \frac{\omega - \omega^{13}}{1 - \omega}.
\end{align*}Since $\omega^{13} = (e^{2 \pi i/13})^{13} = e^{2 \pi i} = 1,$
\[\frac{\omega - \omega^{13}}{1 - \omega} = \frac{\omega - 1}{1 - \omega} = \boxed{-1}.\]

Projecting $P$ onto the $z$-axis, we obtain a right triangle with legs 3 and $r - 1,$ and hypotenuse $r + 1.$  Then by the Pythagorean Theorem,
\[3 + (r - 1)^2 = (r + 1)^2.\]Solving, we find $r=\boxed{\frac{9}{4}}$.
Solving for $x$ and $y$ in the equations $tx - 2y - 3t = 0$ and $x - 2ty + 3 = 0,$ we find
\[x = \frac{3t^2 + 3}{t^2 - 1}, \quad y = \frac{3t}{t^2 - 1}.\]Then
\[x^2 = \frac{(3t^2 + 3)^2}{(t^2 - 1)^2} = \frac{9t^4 + 18t^2 + 9}{t^4 - 2t^2 + 1},\]and
\[y^2 = \frac{9t^2}{(t^2 - 1)^2} = \frac{9t^2}{t^4 - 2t^2 + 1}.\]Thus,
\begin{align*}
x^2 - 4y^2 &= \frac{9t^2 + 18t^2 + 9}{t^4 - 2t^2 + 1} - \frac{36t^2}{t^4 - 2t^2 + 1} \\
&= \frac{9t^4 - 18t^2 + 9}{t^4 - 2t^2 + 1} \\
\end{align*}so
\[\frac{x^2}{9} - \frac{y^2}{\frac{9}{4}} = 1.\]Thus, all the plotted points lie on a hyperbola
The answer is $\boxed{\text{(E)}}.$
Let $P = (x,y,z).$  Then from the equation $AP = DP,$
\[(x - 8)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2.\]This gives us $x = 4.$
Similarly, from the equation $BP = DP,$
\[x^2 + (y + 4)^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2,\]so $y = -2.$
And from the equation $CP = DP,$
\[x^2 + y^2 + (z - 6)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2,\]so $z = 3.$
Therefore, $P = \boxed{(4,-2,3)}.$
The line passes through $\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},$ so its direction vector is proportional to
\[\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.\]To get an $x$-coordinate of 2, we can multiply this vector by the scalar $\frac{2}{3}.$  This gives us
\[\frac{2}{3} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4/3 \end{pmatrix}.\]Therefore, $b = \boxed{\frac{4}{3}}.$
Subtracting the two equations gives $\sin y - 2008 \cos y = 1$
But since $0 \leq y \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$, the maximum of $\sin y$ is 1 and the minimum of $\cos y$ is 0, so we must have $\sin y = 1$, so $y = \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $x = 2007,$ so $x+y = \boxed{2007 + \frac\pi 2}$.
We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} x + a & x  & x \\ x & x + a & x \\ x & x & x + a \end{vmatrix} &= (x + a) \begin{vmatrix} x + a & x \\ x & x + a \end{vmatrix} - x \begin{vmatrix} x & x \\ x & x + a \end{vmatrix} + x \begin{vmatrix} x & x + a \\ x & x \end{vmatrix} \\
&= (x + a)((x + a)^2 - x^2) - x(x(x + a) - x^2) + x(x^2 - (x + a)(x)) \\
&= 3a^2 x + a^3 \\
&= a^2 (3x + a).
\end{align*}Hence, $x = \boxed{-\frac{a}{3}}.$
From the given equation,
\[\tan (5 \pi \cos \theta) = \frac{1}{\tan (5 \pi \sin \theta)},\]so $\tan (5 \pi \cos \theta) \tan (5 \pi \sin \theta) = 1.$
Then from the angle addition formula,
\begin{align*}
\cot (5 \pi \cos \theta + 5 \pi \sin \theta) &= \frac{1}{\tan (5 \pi \cos \theta + 5 \pi \sin \theta)} \\
&= \frac{1 - \tan (5 \pi \cos \theta) \tan (5 \pi \sin \theta)}{\tan (5 \pi \cos \theta) + \tan (5 \pi \sin \theta)} \\
\end{align*}Hence, $5 \pi \cos \theta + 5 \pi \sin \theta$ must be an odd multiple of $\frac{\pi}{2}.$  In other words,
\[5 \pi \cos \theta + 5 \pi \sin \theta = (2n + 1) \cdot \frac{\pi}{2}\]for some integer $n.$  Then
\[\cos \theta + \sin \theta = \frac{2n + 1}{10}.\]Using the angle addition formula, we can write
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta + \sin \theta &= \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cos \theta + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sin \theta \right) \\
&= \sqrt{2} \left( \sin \frac{\pi}{4} \cos \theta + \cos \frac{\pi}{4} \sin \theta \right) \\
&= \sqrt{2} \sin \left( \theta + \frac{\pi}{4} \right).
\end{align*}so
\[\sin \left( \theta + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = \frac{2n + 1}{10 \sqrt{2}}.\]Thus, we need
\[\left| \frac{2n + 1}{10 \sqrt{2}} \right| \le 1.\]The integers $n$ that work are $-7,$ $-6,$ $-5,$ $\dots,$ $6,$ giving us a total of 14 possible values of $n.$  Furthermore, for each such value of $n,$ the equation
\[\sin \left( \theta + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = \frac{2n + 1}{10 \sqrt{2}}.\]has exactly two solutions in $\theta.$  Therefore, there are a total of $\boxed{28}$ solutions $\theta.$
Rational Man's racetrack is parameterized by $x = \cos t$ and $y = \sin t.$  We can eliminate $t$ by writing
\[x^2 + y^2 = \cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1.\]Thus, Rational Man's racetrack is the circle centered at $(0,0)$ with radius 1.
Irrational Man's racetrack is parameterized by $x = 1 + 4 \cos \frac{t}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $y = 2 \sin \frac{t}{\sqrt{2}}.$  Similarly,
\[\frac{(x - 1)^2}{16} + \frac{y^2}{4} = \cos^2 \frac{t}{\sqrt{2}} + \sin^2 \frac{t}{\sqrt{2}} = 1.\]Thus, Irrational Man's race track is the ellipse centered at $(1,0)$ with semi-major axis 4 and semi-minor axis 2.
Let $O = (0,0),$ the center of the circle.

By the Triangle Inequality, $OA + AB \ge OB,$ so
\[AB \ge OB - OA = OB - 1.\]If $B = (x,y),$ then
\[\frac{(x - 1)^2}{16} + \frac{y^2}{4} = 1,\]so $y^2 = -\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{15}{4}.$  Then
\[OB^2 = x^2 + y^2 = \frac{3x^2}{4} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{15}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \left( x + \frac{1}{3} \right)^2 + \frac{11}{3}.\]This is minimized when $x = -\frac{1}{3},$ in which case $OB = \sqrt{\frac{11}{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{33}}{3}.$
If we take $A$ as the intersection of $\overline{OB}$ with the circle, then
\[AB = OB - 1 = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{33} - 3}{3}}.\]
The cross product of any vector with itself is $\mathbf{0} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}}.$
We can also see this by expanding:
\begin{align*}
(\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) &= \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{w} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} \times \mathbf{w} \\
&= \mathbf{0} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} - \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{0} \\
&= \mathbf{0}.
\end{align*}
Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 8 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 8 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x + 8y \\ 2x + y \end{pmatrix},\]and
\[k \mathbf{v} = k \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} kx \\ ky \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, we want $k$, $x$, and $y$ to satisfy
\begin{align*}
x + 8y &= kx, \\
2x + y &= ky.
\end{align*}From the first equation, $(k - 1) x = 8y$
If $x = 0$, then this equation implies $y = 0$
But the vector $\mathbf{v}$ is nonzero, so $x$ is nonzero
From the second equation, $2x = (k - 1) y$
Similarly, if $y = 0$, then this equation implies $x = 0$, so $y$ is nonzero
We also see that $k \neq 1$, because if $k = 1$, then $y = 0$, which again implies $x = 0$.
Hence, we can write
\[\frac{x}{y} = \frac{8}{k - 1} = \frac{k - 1}{2}.\]Cross-multiplying, we get $(k - 1)^2 = 16$
Then $k - 1 = \pm 4.$  Therefore, $k = \boxed{5}$ or $k = \boxed{-3}$.
To make sure that these values of $k$ work, we should check if the corresponding vector $\mathbf{v}$ exists
For $k = 5$, we can take $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, and for $k = -3$, we can take $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, so both values of $k$ are possible.
Let the 12-gon be $ABCDEFGHIJKL,$ and let $O$ be the center, so $OA = 12.$

Let $P$ be a point such that $OP = 12,$ and let $\theta = \angle AOP.$  Let $Q$ be the midpoint of $\overline{AP}.$

O = (0,0);

Then $\angle AOQ = \frac{\theta}{2},$ so $AQ = 12 \sin \frac{\theta}{2},$ and $AP = 24 \sin \frac{\theta}{2}.$
Counting up the sides and diagonals, the sum we want is
\[12AB + 12AC + 12AD + 12AE + 12AF + 6AG.\]We see that $AC = 12,$ $AD = 12 \sqrt{2},$ $AE = 12 \sqrt{3},$ and $AG = 24.$  Also,
\begin{align*}
AB + AF &= 24 \sin 15^\circ + 12 \sin 75^\circ \\
&= 12 \sin 45^\circ \cos 30^\circ \\
&= 12 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
&= 12 \sqrt{6},
\end{align*}so
\begin{align*}
&12AB + 12AC + 12AD + 12AE + 12AF + 6AG \\
&= 12AC + 12AD + 12AE + 12(AB + AF) + 12AG \\
&= 12 \cdot 12 + 12 \cdot 12 \sqrt{2} + 12 \cdot 12 \sqrt{3} + 12 \cdot 12 \sqrt{6} + 6 \cdot 24 \\
&= 288 + 144 \sqrt{2} + 144 \sqrt{3} + 144 \sqrt{6}.
\end{align*}Then $a + b + c + d = 288 + 144 + 144 + 144 = \boxed{720}.$
First, we note that the angle measures form an arithmetic sequence whose average is $111^\circ$.
We have that
\begin{align*}
&\text{cis } 75^\circ + \text{cis } 83^\circ + \text{cis } 91^\circ + \dots + \text{cis } 147^\circ  \\
&= \frac{\text{cis } 75^\circ + \text{cis } 83^\circ + \text{cis } 91^\circ + \dots + \text{cis } 147^\circ}{\text{cis } 111^\circ} \cdot \text{cis } 111^\circ \\
&= [\text{cis } (-36^\circ) + \text{cis } (-28^\circ) + \text{cis } (-20^\circ) + \dots + \text{cis } (36^\circ)] \text{cis } 111^\circ.
\end{align*}The terms of the sum
\[\text{cis } (-36^\circ) + \text{cis } (-28^\circ) + \text{cis } (-20^\circ) + \dots + \text{cis } (36^\circ)\]can be paired into terms of the form $\text{cis } n^\circ + \text{cis } (-n)^\circ$, and
\begin{align*}
\text{cis } n^\circ + \text{cis } (-n)^\circ &= \cos n^\circ + i \sin n^\circ + \cos n^\circ - i \sin n^\circ \\
&= 2 \cos n^\circ,
\end{align*}which is real
Therefore,
\[\text{cis } (-36^\circ) + \text{cis } (-28^\circ) + \text{cis } (-20^\circ) + \dots + \text{cis } (36^\circ)\]is real
\[r = \text{cis } (-36^\circ) + \text{cis } (-28^\circ) + \text{cis } (-20^\circ) + \dots + \text{cis } (36^\circ).\]Then
\[\text{cis } 75^\circ + \text{cis } 83^\circ + \text{cis } 91^\circ + \dots + \text{cis } 147^\circ = r \, \text{cis } 111^\circ,\]so $\theta = \boxed{111^\circ}$.
Let $\mathbf{p} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{q} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},$ and $\mathbf{r} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.$  Then the normal vector to the plane passing through $P,$ $Q,$ and $R$ is
\[(\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}) \times (\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{r}) = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ -2 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ -4 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.\]We can scale this vector, and take $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector
Thus, the equation of the plane is of the form $2x + y - z = d.$  Substituting any of the points, we find the equation of this plane is
\[2x + y - z = 2.\]Plotting this plane, we find it intersects the edge joining $(0,0,4)$ and $(4,0,4),$ say at $S,$ and the edge joining $(0,4,0)$ and $(0,4,4),$ say at $T.$

The equation of the edge passing through $(0,0,4)$ and $(4,0,4)$ is given by $y = 0$ and $z = 4.$  Substituting into $2x + y - z = 2,$ we get
\[2x - 4 = 2,\]so $x = 3.$  Hence, $S = (3,0,4).$
The equation of the edge passing through $(0,0,4)$ and $(4,0,4)$ is given by $x = 0$ and $y = 4.$  Substituting into $2x + y - z = 2,$ we get
\[4 - z = 2,\]so $z = 2.$  Hence, $T = (0,4,2).$
Then $ST = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 2^2} = \boxed{\sqrt{29}}.$
We can write the equation as
\[\frac{\sin A}{\cos A} + \frac{1}{\cos A} = 2,\]so $\sin A + 1 = 2 \cos A.$  Then $\sin A = 2 \cos A - 1.$  Squaring both sides, we get
\[\sin^2 A = 4 \cos^2 A - 4 \cos A + 1.\]Since $\cos^2 A + \sin^2 A = 1,$
\[1 - \cos^2 A = 4 \cos^2 A - 4 \cos A + 1,\]which simplifies to $5 \cos^2 A - 4 \cos A = \cos A (5 \cos A - 4) = 0.$  Hence, $\cos A = 0$ or $\cos A = \frac{4}{5}.$
If $\cos A = 0,$ then $\sec A = \frac{1}{\cos A}$ is not defined
On the other hand, if $A$ is the acute angle such that $\cos A = \frac{4}{5},$ then $\sin A = \frac{3}{5},$ so
\[\tan A + \sec A = \frac{\sin A + 1}{\cos A} = \frac{3/5 + 1}{4/5} = 2.\]Therefore, $\cos A = \boxed{\frac{4}{5}}.$
We can write the equation of the second plane as $x - 3y + 3z = 1.$  Note that $(1,0,0)$ is a point on this plane
(Also, note that both plane have the same normal vector, so they are parallel.)
Therefore, from the formula for the distance between a point and a plane, the distance between the two planes is
\[\frac{|1 - 3 \cdot 0 + 3 \cdot 0 - 8|}{\sqrt{1^2 + (-3)^2 + 3^2}} = \boxed{\frac{7 \sqrt{19}}{19}}.\]
\[f(x,y,z) = |x + y + z| + |x + y - z| + |x - y + z| + |-x + y + z|.\]Note that
\begin{align*}
f(-x,y,z) &= |-x + y + z| + |-x + y - z| + |-x - y + z| + |x + y + z| \\
&= |-x + y + z| + |x - y + z| + |x + y - z| + |x + y + z| \\
&= f(x,y,z).
\end{align*}Similarly, we can prove that $f(x,-y,z) = f(x,y,-z) = f(x,y,z).$  This says that the set of points that satisfy
\[f(x,y,z) \le 4\]is symmetric with respect to the $xy$-, $xz$-, and $yz$-planes
So, we restrict our attention to the octant where all the coordinates are nonnegative.
Suppose $x \ge y$ and $x \ge z.$  (In other words, $x$ is the largest of $x,$ $y,$ and $z.$)  Then
\begin{align*}
f(x,y,z) &= |x + y + z| + |x + y - z| + |x - y + z| + |-x + y + z| \\
&= 3x + y + z + |-x + y + z|.
\end{align*}By the Triangle Inequality, $|-x + y + z| = |x - (y + z)| \ge x - (y + z),$ so
\[f(x,y,z) = 3x + y + z + |-x + y + z| \ge 3x + y + z + x - (y + z) = 4x.\]But $f(x,y,z) \le 4,$ so $x \le 1.$  This implies that each of $x,$ $y,$ $z$ is at most 1.
Also, $|-x + y + z| \ge (y + z) - x,$ so
\[f(x,y,z) = 3x + y + z + |-x + y + z| \ge 3x + y + z + (y + z) - x = 2x + 2y + 2z.\]Hence, $x + y + z \le 2.$
Conversely, if $x \le 1,$ $y \le 1,$ $z \le 1,$ and $x + y + z \le 2,$ then
\[f(x,y,z) \le 4.\]The region defined by $0 \le x,$ $y,$ $z \le 1$ is a cube
The equation $x + y + z = 2$ corresponds to the plane which passes through $(0,1,1),$ $(1,0,1),$ and $(1,1,0),$ so we must cut off the pyramid whose vertices are $(0,1,1),$ $(1,0,1),$ $(1,1,0),$ and $(1,1,1).$

This pyramid has volume $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{6},$ so the remaining volume is $1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}.$
Since we are only looking at one octant, the total volume of the region is $8 \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \boxed{\frac{20}{3}}.$
One way to solve for $p,$ $q,$ and $r$ is to write $p \mathbf{a} + q \mathbf{b} + r \mathbf{c}$ as a three-dimensional vector, set the components to $\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix},$ and then solve the linear system
But we can also take advantage of the fact that $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},$ and $\mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}$ are mutually orthogonal.
We can take the equation, $\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = p \mathbf{a} + q \mathbf{b} + r \mathbf{c},$ and take the dot product of $\mathbf{a}$ with both sides:
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = p \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + q \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + r \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}.\]Note that $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} = 0,$ and we are left with
\[6 = 3a.\]Hence, $a = 2.$
In the same way, we can find $b = -\frac{13}{7}$ and $c = -\frac{4}{7},$ so $(a,b,c) = \boxed{\left( 2, -\frac{13}{7}, -\frac{4}{7} \right)}.$
First, we check if the two lines can intersect
For the two lines to intersect, we must have
\begin{align*}
-1 + s &= \frac{t}{2}, \\
3 - ks &= 1 + t, \\
1 + ks &= 2 - t.
\end{align*}Adding the second equation and third equation, we get $4 = 3,$ contradiction
Thus, the two lines cannot intersect.
So for the two lines to be coplanar, the only other possibility is that they are parallel
For the two lines to be parallel, their direction vectors must be proportional
The direction vectors of the lines are $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -k \\ k \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix},$ respectively
These vectors are proportional when
\[2 = -k.\]Hence, $k = \boxed{-2}.$
We divide into cases.
Case 1: $\sin \theta \tan \theta = \cos^2 \theta.$
The equation becomes $\sin^2 \theta = \cos^3 \theta,$ which we can write as $1 - \cos^2 \theta = \cos^3 \theta.$  Letting $x = \cos \theta,$ we get
\[x^3 + x^2 - 1 = 0.\]Let $f(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 1.$  Clearly $x = -1$ is not a root
If $-1 < x \le 0,$ then $x^2 + x^3 \le x^2 < 1$, so
\[f(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 1 < 0.\]The function $f(x)$ is increasing for $0 \le x \le 1.$  Also, $f(0) = -1$ and $f(1) = 1,$ so $f(x)$ has exactly one root in the interval $[0,1].$  Then the equation $\cos \theta = x$ has two solutions for $0 \le \theta \le 2 \pi.$
Case 2: $\sin \theta \cos \theta = \tan^2 \theta.$
The equation becomes $\cos^3 \theta = \sin \theta.$  In the interval $0 \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2},$ $\sin \theta$ increases from 0 to 1 while $\cos^3 \theta$ decreases from 1 to 0, so there is one solution in this interval
Similarly, in the interval $\pi \le \theta \le \frac{3 \pi}{2},$ $\sin \theta$ decreases from 0 to $-1$ while $\cos^3 \theta$ increases from $-1$ to $0,$ so there is one solution in this interval.
On the intervals $\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \pi$ and $\frac{3 \pi}{2}  < \theta < 2 \pi,$ one of $\sin \theta$ and $\cos^3 \theta$ is positive while the other is negative, so there are no additional solutions.
Case 3: $\cos \theta \tan \theta = \sin^2 \theta.$
The equation becomes $\sin \theta^2 = \sin \theta$, so $\sin \theta$ is 0 or 1
The only solutions are integer multiples of $\frac{\pi}{2},$ so there are no solutions in this case.
Therefore, there are a total of $\boxed{4}$ solutions.
The $z_j$ are equally spaced on the circle, centered at the origin, with radius $2^3 = 8.$  In other words, they are of the form
\[8 \cos \frac{2 \pi j}{12} + 8i \sin \frac{2 \pi j}{12}.\][asy]

dot(2*dir(30*i),linewidth(4*bp));
[/asy]
Geometrically, $iz_j$ is the result of rotating $z_j$ about the origin by $\frac{\pi}{2}$ counter-clockwise
Thus, to maximize the real part of the sum, we should take $w_j = z_j$ for the red points, and $w_j = iz_j$ for the blue points.

int i;

for (i = 5; i <= 10; ++i) {

The real part of the sum is then
\begin{align*}
&8 \cos \frac{11 \pi}{6} + 8 \cos 0 + 8 \cos \frac{\pi}{6} + 8 \cos \frac{\pi}{3} + 8 \cos \frac{\pi}{2} + 8 \cos \frac{2 \pi}{3} \\
&- \left( 8 \sin \frac{5 \pi}{6} + 8 \sin \pi + 8 \sin \frac{7 \pi}{6} + 8 \sin \frac{4 \pi}{3} + 8 \sin \frac{3 \pi}{2} + 8 \sin \frac{5 \pi}{3} \right) \\
&= \boxed{16 + 16 \sqrt{3}}.

Let $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -4 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -8 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -3 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},$ and $\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}.$  Note that
\[\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{d} - \mathbf{c},\]so quadrilateral $ABDC$ is a parallelogram.

The area of the parallelogram is then given by
\[\|(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (\mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a})\| = \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 7 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \boxed{\sqrt{110}}.\]
Since $B$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AA'},$
\[\overrightarrow{B} = \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{A'}.\]Since $C$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BB'},$
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow{C} &= \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{B} + \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{B'} \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{A'} \right) + \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{B'} \\
&= \frac{1}{4} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{1}{4} \overrightarrow{A'} + \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{B'}.
\end{align*}Similarly,
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow{D} &= \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{C} + \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{C'} \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{1}{4} \overrightarrow{A'} + \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{B'} \right) + \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{C'} \\
&= \frac{1}{8} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{1}{8} \overrightarrow{A'} + \frac{1}{4} \overrightarrow{B'} + \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{C'},
\end{align*}and
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow{A} &= \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{D} + \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{D'} \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{8} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{1}{8} \overrightarrow{A'} + \frac{1}{4} \overrightarrow{B'} + \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{C'} \right) + \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{D'} \\
&= \frac{1}{16} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{1}{16} \overrightarrow{A'} + \frac{1}{8} \overrightarrow{B'} + \frac{1}{4} \overrightarrow{C'} + \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{D'}.
\end{align*}Solving for $\overrightarrow{A},$ we find
\[\overrightarrow{A} = \frac{1}{15} \overrightarrow{A'} + \frac{2}{15} \overrightarrow{B'} + \frac{4}{15} \overrightarrow{C'} + \frac{8}{15} \overrightarrow{D'}.\]Thus, $(p,q,r,s) = \boxed{\left( \frac{1}{15}, \frac{2}{15}, \frac{4}{15}, \frac{8}{15} \right)}.$
Since the cosine function has period $360^\circ,$
\[\cos 456^\circ = \cos (456^\circ - 360^\circ) = \cos 96^\circ.\]Since $\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)$ for all angles $x,$
\[\cos 96^\circ = \sin (90^\circ - 96^\circ) = \sin (-6^\circ),\]so $n = \boxed{-6}.$
By the Law of Sines applied to triangle $OAB$, $$\frac{OB}{\sin\angle
OAB}=\frac{AB}{\sin\angle AOB}.$$With $AB = 1$ and $\angle AOB = 30^\circ$, we have \[\frac{OB}{\sin \angle OAB} = \frac{1}{\sin 30^\circ} = 2,\]so  so $OB=2\sin\angle OAB$
Thus, $OB \le \boxed{2}$, with equality if and only if $\angle OAB=90^\circ$.

We take cases, based on which of $\sin \theta,$ $\sin 2 \theta,$ $\sin 3 \theta$ is the middle term.
Case 1: $\sin \theta$ is the middle term.
In this case,
\[2 \sin \theta = \sin 2 \theta + \sin 3 \theta.\]We can write this as $2 \sin \theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta + (3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta),$ so
\[2 \sin \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta = 0.\]Since $\theta$ is acute, $\sin \theta > 0,$ so we can divide by $\sin \theta$ to get
\[2 \cos \theta + 1 - 4 \sin^2 \theta = 0.\]We can write this as $2 \cos \theta + 1 - 4(1 - \cos^2 \theta) = 0,$ or
\[4 \cos^2 \theta + 2 \cos \theta - 3 = 0.\]By the quadratic formula,
\[\cos \theta = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{4}.\]Since $\theta$ is acute, $\cos \theta = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{4}.$
Case 2: $\sin 2 \theta$ is the middle term.
In this case,
\[2 \sin 2 \theta = \sin \theta + \sin 3 \theta.\]Then $4 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \sin \theta + (3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta),$ so
\[4 \sin \theta \cos \theta + 4 \sin^3 \theta - 4 \sin \theta = 0.\]Since $\theta$ is acute, $\sin \theta > 0,$ so we can divide by $4 \sin \theta$ to get
\[\cos \theta + 4 \sin^2 \theta - 1 = 0.\]We can write this as $\cos \theta + 4 (1 - \cos^2 \theta) - 1 = 0,$ or
\[4 \cos^2 \theta - \cos \theta - 3 = 0.\]This factors as $(\cos \theta - 1)(4 \cos \theta + 3) = 0,$ so $\cos \theta = 1$ or $\cos \theta = -\frac{3}{4}.$  Since $\cos \theta$ is acute, $\cos \theta$ is positive and less than 1, so there are no solutions in this case.
Case 2: $\sin 3 \theta$ is the middle term.
In this case,
\[2 \sin 3 \theta = \sin \theta + \sin 2 \theta.\]Then $2 (3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta) = \sin \theta + 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta,$ or
\[8 \sin^3 \theta + 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta - 5 \sin \theta = 0.\]Since $\theta$ is acute, $\sin \theta > 0,$ so we can divide by $\sin \theta$ to get
\[8 \sin^2 \theta + 2 \cos \theta - 5 = 0.\]We can write this as $8 (1 - \cos^2 \theta) + 2 \cos \theta - 5 = 0,$ or
\[8 \cos^2 \theta - 2 \cos \theta - 3 = 0.\]This factors as $(4 \cos \theta - 3)(2 \cos \theta + 1) = 0,$ so $\cos \theta = \frac{3}{4}$ or $\cos \theta = -\frac{1}{2}.$  Since $\theta$ is acute, $\cos \theta = \frac{3}{4}.$
Since $y = \cos x$ is decreasing on the interval $0 < x < \frac{\pi}{2},$ and $\frac{3}{4} > \frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{4},$ the smallest such acute angle $\theta$ satisfies $\cos \theta = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.$
We know that $I$ lies on the angle bisectors $\overline{AD},$ $\overline{BE},$ and $\overline{CF}.$

By the Angle Bisector Theorem, $BD:DC = AB:AC = 4:9,$ so
\[\overrightarrow{D} = \frac{9}{13} \overrightarrow{B} + \frac{4}{13} \overrightarrow{C}.\]Also, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, $CE:EA = BC:AB = 7:4,$ so
\[\overrightarrow{E} = \frac{4}{11} \overrightarrow{C} + \frac{7}{11} \overrightarrow{A}.\]Isolating $\overrightarrow{C}$ in each equation, we obtain
\[\overrightarrow{C} = \frac{13 \overrightarrow{D} - 9 \overrightarrow{B}}{4} = \frac{11 \overrightarrow{E} - 7 \overrightarrow{A}}{4}.\]Then $13 \overrightarrow{D} - 9 \overrightarrow{B} = 11 \overrightarrow{E} - 7 \overrightarrow{A},$ or $13 \overrightarrow{D} + 7 \overrightarrow{A} = 11 \overrightarrow{E} + 9 \overrightarrow{B},$ or
\[\frac{13}{20} \overrightarrow{D} + \frac{7}{20} \overrightarrow{A} = \frac{11}{20} \overrightarrow{E} + \frac{9}{20} \overrightarrow{B}.\]Since the coefficients on both sides of the equation add up to 1, the vector on the left side lies on line $AD,$ and the vector on the right side lies on line $BE.$  Therefore, this common vector is $\overrightarrow{I}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow{I} &= \frac{13}{20} \overrightarrow{D} + \frac{7}{20} \overrightarrow{A} \\
&= \frac{13}{20} \left( \frac{9}{13} \overrightarrow{B} + \frac{4}{13} \overrightarrow{C} \right) + \frac{7}{20} \overrightarrow{A} \\
&= \frac{7}{20} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{9}{20} \overrightarrow{B} + \frac{1}{5} \overrightarrow{C}.
\end{align*}Thus, $(x,y,z) = \boxed{\left( \frac{7}{20}, \frac{9}{20}, \frac{1}{5} \right)}.$
More generally, the incenter $I$ of triangle $ABC$ always satisfies
\[\overrightarrow{I} = \frac{a}{a + b + c} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{b}{a + b + c} \overrightarrow{B} + \frac{c}{a + b + c} \overrightarrow{C}.\]
We have that
\begin{align*}
\left\| k \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \right\| &= \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2k \\ -3k \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \\
&= \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2k - 4 \\ -3k - 7 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \\
&= \sqrt{(2k - 4)^2 + (-3k - 7)^2} \\
&= 13k^2 + 26k + 65,
\end{align*}so we want to solve the equation $\sqrt{13k^2 + 26k + 65} = 2 \sqrt{13}$
Squaring both sides, we get $13k^2 + 26k + 65 = 52$, which simplifies to
\[13k^2 + 26k + 13 = 13(k + 1)^2 = 0.\]The only solution $k = \boxed{-1}.$
By sum-to-product,
\[\cos x + \cos 9x = 2 \cos 5x \cos 4x\]and
\[\cos 3x + \cos 7x = 2 \cos 5x \cos 2x.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\cos x + \cos 3x + \cos 7x + \cos 9x &= 2 \cos 5x \cos 4x + 2 \cos 5x \cos 2x \\
&= 2 \cos 5x (\cos 2x + \cos 4x).
\end{align*}Again by sum-to-product,
\[2 \cos 5x (\cos 2x + \cos 4x) = 4 \cos 5x \cos 3x \cos x,\]so $a + b + c + d = 4 + 1 + 3 + 5 = \boxed{13}.$
First, we find the line passing through $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}.$  This line can be parameterized by

The vector $\mathbf{p}$ itself will be orthogonal to the direction vector $\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},$ so
\[\begin{pmatrix} -t + 1 \\ 4t - 1 \\ -2t + 2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = 0.\]Hence, $(-t + 1)(-1) + (4t - 1)(4) + (-2t + 2)(-2) = 0.$  Solving, we find $t = \frac{3}{7}.$  Hence, $\mathbf{p} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 4/7 \\ 5/7 \\ 8/7 \end{pmatrix}}.$
In coordinate space, let $D = (0,0,1)$ and $E = (0,0,-1).$  Since $CD = EA = 2,$ $C$ lies on a circle centered at $D$ with radius 2, and $A$ lies on a circle centered at $E$ with radius 2
Furthermore, $\angle CDE = \angle DEA = 90^\circ,$ so these circles lies in planes that are perpendicular to $\overline{DE}.$

We can rotate the diagram so that $D$ and $E$ have the same $x$-coordinates
Let $A = (x,y_1,-1)$ and $C = (x,y_2,1).$  Since $EA = CD = 2,$
\[x^2 + y_1^2 = x^2 + y_2^2 = 4.\]Then $y_1^2 = y_2^2,$ so $y_1 = \pm y_2.$
Furthermore, since $AB = BC = 2$ and $\angle ABC = 90^\circ,$ $AC = 2 \sqrt{2}.$  Hence,
\[(y_1 - y_2)^2 + 4 = 8,\]so $(y_1 - y_2)^2 = 4.$  We cannot have $y_1 = y_2,$ so $y_1 = -y_2.$  Then $4y_1^2 = 4,$ so $y_1^2 = 1.$  Without loss of generality, we can assume that $y_1 = 1,$ so $y_2 = -1.$  Also, $x^2 = 3.$  Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x = \sqrt{3},$ so $A = (\sqrt{3},1,-1)$ and $C = (\sqrt{3},-1,1).$
Finally, we are told that the plane of triangle $ABC$ is parallel to $\overline{DE}.$  Since both $A$ and $C$ have $x$-coordinates of $\sqrt{3},$ the equation of this plane is $x = \sqrt{3}.$  The only points $B$ in this plane that satisfy $AB = BC = 2$ are the vertices $B_1$ and $B_2$ of the rectangle shown below, where $B_1 = (\sqrt{3},-1,-1)$ and $B_2 = (\sqrt{3},1,1).$

In either case, triangle $BDE$ is a right triangle where the legs are both 2, so its area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = \boxed{2}.$
First, we factor the given polynomial
The polynomial has almost all the powers of $z$ from 1 to $z^4,$ which we can fill in by adding and subtracting $z.$ This allows us to factor as follows:
\begin{align*}
z^6 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + 1 &= (z^6 - z) + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 \\
&= z(z^5 - 1) + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 \\
&= z(z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 \\
&= (z^2 - z + 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1).
\end{align*}The roots of $z^2 - z + 1 = 0$ are
\[z = \frac{1 \pm i \sqrt{3}}{2},\]which are $\operatorname{cis} 60^\circ$ and $\operatorname{cis} 300^\circ.$
Note that $(z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = z^5 - 1,$ so the roots of
\[z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\]are all the fifth roots of unity, except for 1
Thus, the roots are $\operatorname{cis} 72^\circ,$ $\operatorname{cis} 144^\circ,$ $\operatorname{cis} 216^\circ,$ and $\operatorname{cis} 288^\circ.$
The angles that correspond to a root with a positive imaginary part are $60^\circ,$ $72^\circ,$ and $144^\circ,$ so
\[\theta = 60 + 72 + 144 = \boxed{276}.\]
We can write
\begin{align*}
\sin B \sin C &= \frac{1}{2} (\cos (B - C) - \cos (B + C)) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} (\cos (B - C) - \cos (180^\circ - A)) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} (\cos (B - C) + \cos A).
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
\sin A + \sin B \sin C &= \sin A + \frac{1}{2} \cos A + \frac{1}{2} \cos (B - C) \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} \left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \sin A + \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \cos A \right) + \frac{1}{2} \cos (B - C) \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} \left( \cos \theta \sin A + \sin \theta \cos A \right) + \frac{1}{2} \cos (B - C) \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} \sin (A + \theta) + \frac{1}{2} \cos (B - C),
\end{align*}where $\theta$ is the acute angle such that $\cos \theta = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}$ and $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.$
\[\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} \sin (A + \theta) + \frac{1}{2} \cos (B - C) \le \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]Equality occurs when $A = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta$ and $B = C = \frac{\pi - A}{2},$ so the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}.$
Multiplying the given equations, we get
\[(a + 2b + 2c)(a + 2b - 2c) = -3a^2.\]We can write the left-hand side as $((a + 2b) + 2c)((a + 2b) - 2c),$ so by difference of squares,
\[(a + 2b)^2 - (2c)^2 = -3a^2.\]Then $a^2 + 4ab + 4b^2 - 4c^2 = -3a^2,$ so
\[4a^2 + 4ab + 4b^2 - 4c^2 = 0,\]or $a^2 + ab + b^2 = c^2.$
Then by the Law of Cosines,
\[\cos C = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} = \frac{-ab}{2ab} = -\frac{1}{2}.\]which means $C = \boxed{120^\circ}.$  This clearly must be the largest angle in triangle $ABC.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
\frac{\tan^3 75^\circ + \cot^3 75^\circ}{\tan 75^\circ + \cot 75^\circ} &= \frac{(\tan 75^\circ + \cot 75^\circ)(\tan^2 75^\circ - \tan 75^\circ \cot 75^\circ + \cot^2 75^\circ)}{\tan 75^\circ + \cot 75^\circ} \\
&= \tan^2 75^\circ - \tan 75^\circ \cot 75^\circ + \cot^2 75^\circ \\
&= \tan^2 75^\circ + \cot^2 75^\circ - 1 \\
&= \frac{\sin^2 75^\circ}{\cos^2 75^\circ} + \frac{\cos^2 75^\circ}{\sin^2 75^\circ} - 1 \\
&= \frac{\sin^4 75^\circ + \cos^4 75^\circ}{\cos^2 75^\circ \sin^2 75^\circ} - 1 \\
&= \frac{(\sin^2 75^\circ + \cos^2 75^\circ)^2 - 2 \cos^2 75^\circ \sin^2 75^\circ}{\cos^2 75^\circ \sin^2 75^\circ} - 1 \\
&= \frac{1 - 2 \cos^2 75^\circ \sin^2 75^\circ}{\cos^2 75^\circ \sin^2 75^\circ} - 1.
\end{align*}By the double-angle formula,
\[2 \cos 75^\circ \sin 75^\circ = \sin 150^\circ = \frac{1}{2},\]so $\cos 75^\circ \sin 75^\circ = \frac{1}{4}.$  Hence,
\[\frac{1 - 2 \cos^2 75^\circ \sin^2 75^\circ}{\cos^2 75^\circ \sin^2 75^\circ} - 1 = \frac{1 - 2 (\frac{1}{4})^2}{(\frac{1}{4})^2} - 1 = \boxed{13}.\]
We know that $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1.$  Squaring this equation, we get
\[\sin^4 x + 2 \sin^2 x \cos^2 x + \cos^4 x = 1,\]so
\begin{align*}
\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x &= 1 - 2 \sin^2 x \cos^2 x \\
&= 1 - 2 (\sin^2 x)(1 - \sin^2 x) \\
&= 2 \sin^4 x - 2 \sin^2 x + 1 \\
&= 2 \left( \sin^2 x - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{2}.
\end{align*}This expression is minimized when $\sin^2 x = \frac{1}{2}$ (which occurs when $x = \frac{\pi}{4},$ for example), so the minimum value is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
First, let $a$ and $b$ be nonnegative real numbers such that
\[\sin (ax + b) = \sin 29x\]for all integers $x.$  Let $a' = a + 2 \pi n$ for some integer $n.$  Then
\begin{align*}
\sin (a' x + b) &= \sin ((a + 2 \pi n) x + b) \\
&= \sin (ax + b + 2 \pi n x) \\
&= \sin (ax + b) \\
&= \sin 29x
\end{align*}for all integers $x.$
Conversely, suppose $a,$ $a',$ and $b$ are nonnegative real numbers such that
\[\sin (ax + b) = \sin (a'x + b) = \sin 29x \quad (*)\]for all integers $x.$  Then from the angle addition formula,
\[\sin ax \cos b + \cos ax \sin b = \sin a'x \cos b + \cos a'x \sin b = \sin 29x.\]Taking $x = 0$ in $(*),$ we get $\sin b = 0.$  Hence,
\[\sin ax \cos b = \sin a'x \cos b.\]Since $\cos b \neq 0,$
\[\sin ax = \sin a'x\]for all integers $x.$
Taking $x = 1,$ we get $\sin a = \sin a'.$  Taking $x = 2,$ we get $\sin 2a = \sin 2a'.$  From the angle addition formula,
\[\sin 2a = \sin a \cos a + \cos a \sin a = 2 \sin a \cos a.\]Similarly, $\sin 2a' = 2 \sin a' \cos a',$ so
\[2 \sin a \cos a = 2 \sin a' \cos a'.\]Taking $x = 1$ in $\sin ax \cos b = \sin a'x \cos b = \sin 29x,$ we get
\[\sin a \cos b = \sin a' \cos b = \sin 29,\]which means $\sin a = \sin a' \neq 0.$  Thus, we can safely divide both sides of $2 \sin a \cos a = 2 \sin a' \cos a'$ by $2 \sin a = 2 \sin a',$ to get
\[\cos a = \cos a'.\]Finally, since $\sin a = \sin a'$ and $\cos a = \cos a',$ $a$ and $a'$ must differ by a multiple of $2 \pi.$
In our work, we derived that if
\[\sin (ax + b) = \sin 29x\]for all integers $x,$ then $\sin b = 0,$ so $b$ is a multiple of $\pi.$  Since the sine function has period $2 \pi,$ we only need to consider the cases where $b = 0$ or $b = \pi.$
If $b = 0,$ then
\[\sin ax = \sin 29x\]for all integers $x.$  We see that $a = 29$ works, so the only solutions are of the form $a = 29 + 2k \pi,$ where $k$ is an integer
The smallest nonnegative real number of this form is $a = 29 - 8 \pi.$
If $b = \pi,$ then
\[\sin (ax + \pi) = \sin 29x\]for all integers $x.$  We see that $a = -29$ works, since
\[\sin (-29x + \pi) = \sin (-29x) \cos \pi = \sin 29x.\]So the only solutions are of the form $a = -29 + 2k \pi,$ where $k$ is an integer
The smallest nonnegative real number of this form is $a = -29 + 10 \pi.$
Thus, the smallest such constant $a$ is $\boxed{10 \pi - 29}.$
Solution 1
By the vector triple product, $\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}) = (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w}) \mathbf{v} - (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{w},$ so
\[(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{a} - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a}) \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{0}.\]Since $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 = 1,$ this tells us
\[\mathbf{c} = (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}.\]Let $k = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c},$ so $\mathbf{c} = k \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}.$  Then
\[\|\mathbf{c}\|^2 = \|k \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\|^2.\]Since $\mathbf{b} = -\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}),$ the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are orthogonal
Hence,
\[4 = k^2 + 1,\]so $k = \pm \sqrt{3}.$  Then
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{c}\|} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\]so $\theta$ can be $\boxed{30^\circ}$ or $\boxed{150^\circ}.$
Solution 2
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  Let $\mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}.$  Then
\[\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{a} \times \begin{pmatrix} -y \\ x \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -x \\ -y \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},\]so $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.$
Since $\|\mathbf{b}\| = 1$ and $\|\mathbf{c}\| = 2,$ $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ and $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4.$  Hence, $z^2 = 3,$ so
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{c}\|} = \frac{z}{2} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.\]This means the possible values of $\theta$ are $\boxed{30^\circ}$ or $\boxed{150^\circ}.$

Then $\angle B'AD = 90^\circ - \alpha,$ and by symmetry, $\angle B'AP = \angle DAP = \frac{90^\circ - \alpha}{2} = 45^\circ - \frac{\alpha}{2}.$  Then
\[B'P = \tan \left( 45^\circ - \frac{\alpha}{2} \right) = \frac{\tan 45^\circ - \tan \frac{\alpha}{2}}{1 + \tan 45^\circ \tan \frac{\alpha}{2}} = \frac{1 - \tan \frac{\alpha}{2}}{1 + \tan \frac{\alpha}{2}}.\]Since $\alpha$ is acute,
\[\sin \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^2} = \frac{3}{5},\]so
\[\tan \frac{\alpha}{2} = \frac{\sin \alpha}{1 + \cos \alpha} = \frac{3/5}{1 + 4/5} = \frac{1}{3}.\]Then
\[BP = \frac{1 - 1/3}{1 + 1/3} = \frac{1}{2},\]so $[AB'P] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{4}.$  Also, $[ADP] = \frac{1}{4},$ so the area of the shaded region is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
We have that
\[\mathbf{D} = \begin{pmatrix} 7 & 0 \\ 0 & 7 \end{pmatrix},\]so $\det \mathbf{D} = \boxed{49}.$
The function $\sin x$ is increasing on the interval $\left[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right],$ so it is increasing on the interval $[-1,1].$  Hence,
\[\sin \sin x = \sin \sin y\]implies $\sin x = \sin y.$  In turn, $\sin x = \sin y$ is equivalent to $y = x + 2k \pi$ or $y = (2k + 1) \pi - x$ for some integer $k.$  Note that for a fixed integer $k,$ the equations $y = x + 2k \pi$ and $y = (2k + 1) \pi - x$ correspond to a line
These lines are graphed below, in the region $-10 \pi \le x,$ $y \le 10 \pi.$

These lines divide the square into 400 smaller squares, exactly half of which contain an intersection point
Furthermore, exactly 20 of them lie on the line $y = x,$ so the probability that $X = Y$ is $\frac{20}{400} = \boxed{\frac{1}{20}}.$
We have that
\[\cot (-60^\circ) = \frac{1}{\tan (-60^\circ)}.\]Then
\[\tan (-60^\circ) = -\tan 60^\circ = -\sqrt{3},\]so
\[\frac{1}{\tan (-60^\circ)} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \boxed{-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}}.\]
Since $|z| = 1,$ we can write $z = \operatorname{cis} \theta,$ where $0^\circ \le \theta < 360^\circ.$  Then
\[z^{6!} - z^{5!} = \operatorname{cis} (720 \theta) - \operatorname{cis} (120 \theta)\]is a real number
In other words, $\sin 720 \theta - \sin 120 \theta = 0.$  From the sum-to-product formulas,
\[2 \cos 420 \theta \sin 300 \theta = 0.\]If $\cos 420 \theta = 0,$ then $420 \theta$ must be an odd multiple of $90^\circ,$ i.e.
\[420 \theta = (2n + 1) 90^\circ\]for some integer $n.$  The possible values of $n$ are 0, 1, 2, $\dots,$ 839, for 840 solutions.
If $\sin 300 \theta = 0,$ then $300 \theta$ must be a multiple of $180^\circ,$ i.e.
\[300 \theta = m \cdot 180^\circ\]for some integer $m.$  The possible values of $m$ are 0, 1, 2, $\dots,$ 599, for 600 solutions.
If a $\theta$ can be produced by both of these inequalities, then
\[ \theta = \dfrac{(2n + 1) 90^\circ}{420} = \dfrac{m \cdot 180^\circ}{300}, \]or $5(2n + 1) = 14m.$ There are no integer solutions to this equation since the left hand side would be odd while the right hand side would be even.
So we have not overcounted, and there are a total of $840 + 600 = \boxed{1440}$ solutions.

Note that
\[\overrightarrow{BA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 - 5 \\ 2 - 3 \\ 3 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \overrightarrow{BC} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 - 5 \\ 4 - 3 \\ 5 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.\]Then the projection of $\overrightarrow{BA}$ onto $\overrightarrow{BC}$ is
\[\overrightarrow{BD} = \frac{\overrightarrow{AB} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC}}{\overrightarrow{BC} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC}} \overrightarrow{BC} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \left\| \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{15}{21} \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -10/7 \\ 5/7 \\ 20/7 \end{pmatrix}.\]It follows that
\[\overrightarrow{AD} = \overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{BD} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -10/7 \\ 5/7 \\ 20/7 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 18/7 \\ 12/7 \\ 6/7 \end{pmatrix}.\]Note that this is proportional to $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  So, line $AD$ can be parameterized by
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 + 3t \\ 2 + 2t \\ 3 + t \end{pmatrix}.\]Setting this to $H,$ we find
\[\overrightarrow{CH} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + 3t \\ 2 + 2t \\ 3 + t \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 + 3t \\ -2 + 2t \\ -2 + t \end{pmatrix}.\]This vector will be orthogonal to $\overrightarrow{BA},$ so
\[\begin{pmatrix} -2 + 3t \\ -2 + 2t \\ -2 + t \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = 0.\]Then $(-2 + 3t)(-4) + (-2 + 2t)(-1) + (-2 + t)(2) = 0.$  Solving, we find $t = \frac{1}{2}.$  Therefore, $H = \boxed{\left( \frac{5}{2}, 3, \frac{7}{2} \right)}.$
We have $|12-9i| = \sqrt{12^2 + (-9)^2} = 15$ and $|8+15i| = \sqrt{8^2 + 15^2} = 17$, so $|(12-9i)(8+15i)| = |12-9i|\cdot |8+15i| = 15\cdot 17 = \boxed{255}$.
Squaring both equations, we get $\sin^2 A + 2 \sin A \sin B + \sin^2 B = 1$ and $\cos^2 A + 2 \cos A \cos B + \cos^2 B = \frac{9}{4},$ so
\[\sin^2 A + 2 \sin A \sin B + \sin^2 B + \cos^2 A + 2 \cos A \cos B + \cos^2 B = \frac{13}{4}.\]Then $2 \sin A \sin B + 2 \cos A \cos B = \frac{13}{4} - 2 = \frac{5}{4},$ so from the angle subtraction formula,
\[\cos (A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B = \boxed{\frac{5}{8}}.\]
From the given equation,
\[\arcsin 2x = \frac{\pi}{3} - \arcsin x.\]Then
\[\sin (\arcsin 2x) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{3} - \arcsin x \right).\]Hence, from the angle subtraction formula,
\begin{align*}
2x &= \sin \frac{\pi}{3} \cos (\arcsin x) - \cos \frac{\pi}{3} \sin (\arcsin x) \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{x}{2}.
\end{align*}Then $5x = \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2}.$  Squaring both sides, we get
\[25x^2 = 3 - 3x^2,\]so $28x^2 = 3.$  This leads to $x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{21}}{14}.$
If $x = -\frac{\sqrt{21}}{14},$ then both $\arcsin x$ and $\arcsin 2x$ are negative, so $x = -\frac{\sqrt{21}}{14}$ is not a solution.
On the other hand, $0 < \frac{\sqrt{21}}{14} < \frac{1}{2},$ so
\[0 < \arcsin \frac{\sqrt{21}}{14} < \frac{\pi}{6}.\]Also, $0 < \frac{\sqrt{21}}{7} < \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ so
\[0 < \arcsin \frac{\sqrt{21}}{7} < \frac{\pi}{4}.\]Therefore,
\[0 < \arcsin \frac{\sqrt{21}}{14} + \arcsin \frac{\sqrt{21}}{7} < \frac{5 \pi}{12}.\]Also,
\begin{align*}
\sin \left( \arcsin \frac{\sqrt{21}}{14} + \arcsin \frac{\sqrt{21}}{7} \right) &= \frac{\sqrt{21}}{14} \cos \left( \arcsin \frac{\sqrt{21}}{7} \right) + \cos \left( \arcsin \frac{\sqrt{21}}{14} \right) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{7} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{21}}{14} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{21}{49}} + \sqrt{1 - \frac{21}{196}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{7} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\end{align*}We conclude that
\[\arcsin \frac{\sqrt{21}}{14} + \arcsin \frac{\sqrt{21}}{7} = \frac{\pi}{3}.\]Thus, the only solution is $x = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{14}}.$
Let $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real
$$|e^z| = |e^{x+yi}| = |e^x \cdot e^{iy}| = |e^x| \cdot |e^{iy}| = e^x \cdot 1 = e^x.$$So $e^z$ is inside the unit circle if $x < 0$, is on the unit circle if $x = 0$, and is outside the unit circle if $x > 0$.
Also, note that $z$ is closer to $-1$ than to $1$ if $x < 0$, is equidistant to $1$ and $-1$ if $x = 0$, and is closer to $1$ than to $-1$ if $x > 0$
So $\frac{z-1}{z+1}$ is outside the unit circle (or undefined) if $x < 0$, is on the unit circle if $x = 0$, and is inside the unit circle if $x > 0$.
Comparing the two previous paragraphs, we see that if $  e^z = \frac{z - 1}{z + 1},$ then $x = 0$
So $z$ is the purely imaginary number $yi$.
Also, note that $z$ satisfies the original equation if and only if $-z$ does
So at first we will assume that $y$ is positive, and at the end we will double the number of roots to account for negative $y$
(Note that $y \ne 0$, because $z = 0$ is not a root of the original equation.)
Substituting $z = yi$ into the equation $  e^z = \frac{z - 1}{z + 1}$ gives the new equation
$$  e^{iy} = \frac{iy - 1}{iy + 1}.$$By the first two paragraphs, we know that both sides of the equation are always on the unit circle
The only thing we don’t know is when the two sides are at the same point on the unit circle.
Given a nonzero complex number $w$, the angle of $w$ (often called the argument of $w$) is the angle in the interval $[0, 2\pi)$ that the segment from $0$ to $w$ makes with the positive $x$-axis
(In other words, the angle when $w$ is written in polar form.)
Let’s reason about angles
As $y$ increases from $0$ to $\infty$, the angle of $iy -1$ strictly decreases from $\pi$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$, while the angle of $iy+1$ strictly increases from $0$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$
So the angle of $\frac{iy - 1}{iy + 1}$ strictly decreases from $\pi$ to $0$.
Let $n$ be a nonnegative integer
We will consider $y$ in the interval from $2n\pi$ to $(2n + 2)\pi$
As $y$ increases from $2n\pi$ to $(2n + 1)\pi$, the angle of $e^{iy}$ strictly increases from $0$ to $\pi$
As $y$ increases from $(2n+ 1)\pi$ to just under $(2n+ 2)\pi$, the angle of $e^{iy}$ strictly increases from $\pi$ to just under $2\pi$.
Comparing the angle information for  $\frac{iy - 1}{iy + 1}$ and $e^{iy}$ above, we see that $\frac{iy - 1}{iy + 1}$ and $e^{iy}$ are equal for exactly one $y$ in $(2n\pi,(2n + 1)\pi)$, and for no $y$ in $[(2n + 1)\pi,(2n + 2)\pi]$
So we have exactly one root of $y$ in each of $(0, \pi)$, $(2\pi, 3\pi), (4\pi, 5\pi), (6\pi, 7\pi)$, and $(8\pi, 9\pi)$
That gives $5$ positive roots for $y$
We don’t have to go further because $9\pi < 30 < 10\pi$.
Because we have $5$ positive roots for $y$, by symmetry we have $5$ negative roots for $y$
Altogether, the total number of roots is $\boxed{10}$.

\end{align*}Also, $\mathbf{p} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} + \mathbf{r}}{2},$ so
\[\mathbf{r} = 2 \mathbf{p} - \mathbf{v} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} \frac{6}{5} \\ \frac{18}{5} \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 12/5 \\ 16/5 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Since $\sin x < \tan x$ for $0 < x < \frac{\pi}{2},$ the hypotenuse of the right triangle can only be $\cos x$ or $\tan x.$
If $\tan x$ is the hypotenuse, then
\[\tan^2 x = \sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1.\]If $\cos x$ is the hypotenuse, then
\[\cos^2 x = \tan^2 x + \sin^2 x.\]Then
\[\cos^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos^2 x}{\cos^2 x} + 1 - \cos^2 x.\]This simplifies to $\cos^4 x = \frac{1}{2}.$  Then $\cos^2 x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ so
\[\tan^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos^2 x}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} = \sqrt{2} - 1.\]Thus, the sum of all possible values of $\tan^2 x$ is $1 + (\sqrt{2} - 1) = \boxed{\sqrt{2}}.$
Let $A = (0,7,10),$ $B = (-1,6,6),$ and $C = (-4,9,6).$  Then from the distance formula, $AB = 3 \sqrt{2},$ $AC = 6,$ and $BC = 3 \sqrt{2}.$  Note that
\[AB^2 + BC^2 = 18 + 18 = 36 = AC,\]so triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle, with a right angle at vertex $B.$  Hence, the area of the triangle is
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot BC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \sqrt{2} \cdot 3 \sqrt{2} = \boxed{9}.\]
Let $x = \tan \frac{a}{2}.$  Then
\[x^2 = \tan^2 \frac{a}{2} = \frac{\sin^2 \frac{a}{2}}{\cos^2 \frac{a}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1 - \cos a}{2}}{\frac{1 + \cos a}{2}} = \frac{1 - \cos a}{1 + \cos a}.\]Solving for $\cos a,$ we find
\[\cos a = \frac{1 - x^2}{1 + x^2}.\]Similarly, if we let $y = \tan \frac{b}{2},$ then
\[\cos b = \frac{1 - y^2}{1 + y^2}.\]Hence,
\[5 \left( \frac{1 - x^2}{1 + x^2} + \frac{1 - y^2}{1 + y^2} \right) + 4 \left( \frac{1 - x^2}{1 + x^2} \cdot \frac{1 - y^2}{1 + y^2} + 1 \right) = 0.\]This simplifies to $x^2 y^2 = 9,$ so the possible values of $xy$ are $\boxed{3,-3}.$  For example, $a = b = \frac{2 \pi}{3}$ leads to $xy = 3,$ and $a = \frac{2 \pi}{3}$ and $b = \frac{4 \pi}{3}$ leads to $xy = -3.$
The solutions of the equation $z^{1997} = 1$ are the $1997$th roots of unity and are equal to $\cos\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right)$ for $k = 0,1,\ldots,1996.$  They are also located at the vertices of a regular $1997$-gon that is centered at the origin in the complex plane.
By rotating around the origin, we can assume that $v = 1.$  Then
\begin{align*}
|v + w|^2 & = \left|\cos\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) + 1 \right|^2 \\
& = \left|\left[\cos\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) + 1\right] + i\sin\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right)\right|^2 \\
& = \cos^2\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) + 2\cos\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) + 1 + \sin^2\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) \\
& = 2 + 2\cos\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right).
\end{align*}We want $|v + w|^2\ge 2 + \sqrt {3}.$  From what we just obtained, this is equivalent to $\cos\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right)\ge \frac {\sqrt {3}}2.$  This occurs when $\frac {\pi}6\ge \frac {2\pi k}{1997}\ge - \frac {\pi}6$ which is satisfied by $k = 166,165,\ldots, - 165, - 166$ (we don't include 0 because that corresponds to $v$)
So out of the $1996$ possible $k$, $332$ work
Thus, the desired probability is $\frac{332}{1996} = \boxed{\frac{83}{499}}.$
Let $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 4 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},$ and $\mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.$  Then the normal vector of the plane is orthogonal to both
\[\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\]and
\[\mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.\]So to compute the normal vector, we take the cross product of these vectors:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 8 \\ -8 \end{pmatrix}.\]We can scale this vector, and take $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector
Then the equation of the plane is of the form
\[x + 2y - 2z + D = 0.\]Substituting the coordinates of any of the points, we find that the equation of the plane is $\boxed{x + 2y - 2z - 9 = 0}.$
Let $\angle DBE = \alpha$ and $\angle DBC = \beta$
Then $\angle CBE = \alpha - \beta$ and $\angle ABE = \alpha +
\beta$, so $\tan(\alpha - \beta)\tan(\alpha + \beta) = \tan^2
\alpha$
Thus \[\frac{\tan \alpha - \tan \beta}{1 + \tan \alpha \tan \beta}\cdot \frac{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}{1 - \tan \alpha \tan\beta} = \tan^2 \alpha.\]It follows that \[
\tan^2 \alpha - \tan^2 \beta = \tan^2 \alpha(1-\tan^2 \alpha\tan^2\beta).
\]Upon simplifying, $\tan^2 \beta(\tan^4 \alpha - 1) = 0$, so $\tan
\alpha = 1$ and $\alpha = \frac{\pi}{4}$.
Let $DC = a$ and $BD =
Then $\cot \angle DBC = \frac{b}{a}$
Because $\angle CBE =
\frac{\pi}{4} - \beta$ and $\angle ABE = \frac{\pi}{4} + \beta$, it follows that \[\cot \angle CBE = \tan \angle ABE = \tan \left( \frac{\pi}{4} + \beta \right) = \frac{1+\frac{a}{b}}{1-\frac{a}{b}} =
\frac{b+a}{b-a}.\]Thus the numbers 1, $\frac{b+a}{b-a}$, and $\frac{b}{a}$ form an arithmetic progression, so $\frac{b}{a} =
\frac{b+3a}{b-a}$
Setting $b=ka$ yields \[k^2 - 2k - 3=0,\]and the only positive solution is $k=3$.
Hence $b=\frac{BE}{\sqrt{2}} = 5 \sqrt{2},\, a = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{3}$, and the area of triangle $ABC$ is $ab = \boxed{\frac{50}{3}}$.
We have that
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & -2 \\ 0 & 4 & -3 \\ -1 & 4 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & -2 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & -3 \\ 4 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -5 & -2 & -3 \\ -8 & 0 & -12 \\ 14 & 2 & -12 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Solution 1: We have that
\begin{align*}
\text{proj}_{\bold{w}} \bold{v} &= \frac{\bold{v} \cdot \bold{w}}{\bold{w} \cdot \bold{w}} \bold{w} \\
&= \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ y \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 9 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 9 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 9 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{9 + 3y}{90} \begin{pmatrix} 9 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{3 + y}{30} \begin{pmatrix} 9 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}Thus, we want $y$ to satisfy
\[\frac{3 + y}{30} = -\frac{2}{3}.\]Solving, we find $y = \boxed{-23}.$
Solution 2: Geometrically, the vectors $\bold{v} - \text{proj}_{\bold{w}} \bold{v}$ and $\bold{w}$ are orthogonal.

Then $(\bold{v} - \text{proj}_{\bold{w}} \bold{v}) \cdot \bold{w} = 0$
Substituting what we know, we get
\[\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ y + 2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 9 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 0,\]so $7 \cdot 9 + (y + 2) \cdot 3 = 0$
Solving for $y$, we find $y = \boxed{-23}$.
Let $x = \arccos (\sin 2).$  Then
\begin{align*}
\cos x &= \sin 2 \\
&= \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 2 \right) \\
&= \cos \left( 2 - \frac{\pi}{2} \right).
\end{align*}Since $0 \le 2 - \frac{\pi}{2} \le \pi,$ $x = \boxed{2 - \frac{\pi}{2}}.$
From the double-angle formula,
\[\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}.\]Then the sum becomes
\begin{align*}
&\frac{1 - \cos 8^\circ}{2} + \frac{1 - \cos 16^\circ}{2} + \frac{1 - \cos 24^\circ}{2} + \dots + \frac{1 - \cos 352^\circ}{2} \\
&= 22 - \frac{1}{2} (\cos 8^\circ + \cos 16^\circ + \cos 24^\circ + \dots + \cos 352^\circ).
\end{align*}Consider the sum $x = \cos 0^\circ + \cos 8^\circ + \cos 16^\circ + \dots + \cos 352^\circ.$  This is the real part of
\[z = \operatorname{cis} 0^\circ + \operatorname{cis} 8^\circ + \operatorname{cis} 16^\circ + \dots + \operatorname{cis} 352^\circ.\]Then
\begin{align*}
z \operatorname{cis} 8^\circ &= \operatorname{cis} 8^\circ + \operatorname{cis} 16^\circ + \operatorname{cis} 24^\circ + \dots + \operatorname{cis} 360^\circ \\
&= \operatorname{cis} 8^\circ + \operatorname{cis} 16^\circ + \operatorname{cis} 24^\circ + \dots + \operatorname{cis} 0^\circ \\
\end{align*}so $z (\operatorname{cis} 8^\circ - 1) = 0.$  Hence, $z = 0,$ which means $x = 0.$  Therefore,
\[\cos 8^\circ + \cos 16^\circ + \cos 24^\circ + \dots + \cos 352^\circ = -\cos 0 = -1,\]so
\[22 - \frac{1}{2} (\cos 8^\circ + \cos 16^\circ + \cos 24^\circ + \dots + \cos 352^\circ) = 22 + \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{45}{2}}.\]
Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}$ be a vector on the line $y = \frac{5}{2} x + 4,$ so $b = \frac{5}{2} a + 4.$  Let $\mathbf{w} = \begin{pmatrix} c \\ d \end{pmatrix}.$  Then the projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\mathbf{w}$ is
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{w}} \mathbf{v} &= \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|^2} \mathbf{w} \\
&= \frac{\begin{pmatrix} a \\ \frac{5}{2} a + 4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} c \\ d \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} c \\ d \end{pmatrix} \right\|^2} \begin{pmatrix} c \\ d \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{ac + \frac{5}{2} ad + 4d}{c^2 + d^2} \begin{pmatrix} c \\ d \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{a (c + \frac{5}{2} d) + 4d}{c^2 + d^2} \begin{pmatrix} c \\ d \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}The vector $\mathbf{v}$ varies along the line as $a$ varies over real numbers, so the only way that this projection vector can be the same for every such vector $\mathbf{v}$ is if this projection vector is independent of $a.$  In turn, the only way that this can occur is if $c + \frac{5}{2} d = 0.$  This means $c = -\frac{5}{2} d,$ so
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{w}} \mathbf{v} &= \frac{d}{c^2 + d^2} \begin{pmatrix} c \\ d \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{4d}{(-\frac{5}{2} d)^2 + d^2} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{5}{2} d \\ d \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{4d}{\frac{29}{4} d^2} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{5}{2} d \\ d \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{16}{29d} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{5}{2} d \\ d \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -40/29 \\ 16/29 \end{pmatrix}}.
\end{align*}Geometrically, the vector $\mathbf{p}$ must be orthogonal to the direction vector of the line.

The graph of $y = \sin x$ intersects the line $y = \sin 70^\circ$ at points of the form $(70^\circ + 360^\circ n, \sin 70^\circ)$ and $(110^\circ + 360^\circ n, \sin 70^\circ),$ where $n$ is an integer.

The ratio of the lengths is then
\[\frac{110 - 70}{70 + 250} = \frac{40}{320} = \frac{1}{8},\]so $(p,q) = \boxed{(1,8)}.$
From the double angle formulas, $\sin x = 2 \sin \frac{x}{2} \cos \frac{x}{2}$ and $\cos x = 2 \cos^2 \frac{x}{2} - 1 = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \frac{x}{2},$ so
\begin{align*}
\frac{1 + \sin x - \cos x}{1 + \sin x + \cos x} &= \frac{1 + 2 \sin \frac{x}{2} \cos \frac{x}{2} - 1 + 2 \sin^2 \frac{x}{2}}{1 + 2 \sin \frac{x}{2} \cos \frac{x}{2} + 2 \cos^2 \frac{x}{2} - 1} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin \frac{x}{2} \cos \frac{x}{2} + 2 \sin^2 \frac{x}{2}}{2 \sin \frac{x}{2} \cos \frac{x}{2} + 2 \cos^2 \frac{x}{2}} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin \frac{x}{2} (\cos \frac{x}{2} + \sin \frac{x}{2})}{2 \cos \frac{x}{2} (\sin \frac{x}{2} + \cos \frac{x}{2})} \\
&= \frac{\sin \frac{x}{2}}{\cos \frac{x}{2}} \\
&= \boxed{\tan \frac{x}{2}}.
\end{align*}
From the given information, $|\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})| = 4.$  We want to compute
\[|(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot ((\mathbf{b} +  3\mathbf{c}) \times (\mathbf{c} - 7 \mathbf{a}))|.\]Expanding the cross product, we get
\begin{align*}
(\mathbf{b} +  3\mathbf{c}) \times (\mathbf{c} - 7 \mathbf{a}) &= \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 7 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} + 3 \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{c} - 21 \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a} \\
&= \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 7 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 21 \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}.
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot ((\mathbf{b} +  3\mathbf{c}) \times (\mathbf{c} - 7 \mathbf{a})) &= (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 7 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 21 \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) \\
&= \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 7 \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 21 \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) \\
&\quad + \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 7 \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 21 \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}).
\end{align*}Since $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}$ are orthogonal, their dot product is 0
Similar terms vanish, and we are left with
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 21 \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}).\]By the scalar triple product, $\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),$ so the volume of the new parallelepiped is $|-20 \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})| = 20 \cdot 4 = \boxed{80}.$
Since $\frac{x}{2} = \arcsin (\sin x),$ we must have $-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \frac{x}{2} \le \frac{\pi}{2},$ or
\[-\pi \le x \le \pi.\]Taking the sine of both sides of the given equation, we get
\[\sin (\arcsin (\sin x)) = \sin \frac{x}{2},\]which simplifies to
\[\sin x = \sin \frac{x}{2}.\]Then from the double angle formula,
\[2 \sin \frac{x}{2} \cos \frac{x}{2} = \sin \frac{x}{2},\]so $2 \sin \frac{x}{2} \cos \frac{x}{2} - \sin \frac{x}{2} = 0.$  This factors as
\[\sin \frac{x}{2} \left( 2 \cos \frac{x}{2} - 1 \right) = 0,\]so $\sin \frac{x}{2} = 0$ or $\cos \frac{x}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.$
If $\sin \frac{x}{2} = 0,$ then $x = 0.$  If $\cos \frac{x}{2} = \frac{1}{2},$ then $x = \pm \frac{2 \pi}{3}.$  We check that all these values work, so the solutions are $\boxed{-\frac{2 \pi}{3}, 0, \frac{2 \pi}{3}}.$
If $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors, then
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta &= \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \cdot \left\| \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} \\
&= \frac{2 \cdot (-3) + 5 \cdot 7}{\sqrt{2^2 + 5^2} \cdot \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 7^2}} \\
&= \frac{29}{\sqrt{29} \sqrt{58}} \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{align*}Therefore, $\cos \theta = \boxed{45^\circ}.$
Let the triangle be $ABC,$ where $AB = 7,$ $BC = 8,$ and $AC = 9.$  Let the two lines be $PQ$ and $RS,$ as shown below.

R = interp(C,A,6/9);
S = interp(C,B,6/8);

Let $p = AP$ and $q = AQ.$  Since line $PQ$ bisects the perimeter of the triangle,
\[p + q = \frac{7 + 8 + 9}{2} = 12.\]The area of triangle $APQ$ is $\frac{1}{2} pq \sin A,$ and the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot \sin A = \frac{63}{2} \sin A.$  Since line $PQ$ bisects the area of the triangle,
\[\frac{1}{2} pq \sin A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{63}{2} \sin A,\]so $pq = \frac{63}{2}.$  Then by Vieta's formulas, $p$ and $q$ are the roots of the quadratic
\[t^2 - 12t + \frac{63}{2} = 0.\]By the quadratic formula,
\[t = \frac{12 \pm 3 \sqrt{2}}{2}.\]Since $\frac{12 + 3 \sqrt{2}}{2} > 8$ and $p = AP < AB = 7,$ we must have $p = \frac{12 - 3 \sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $q = \frac{12 + 3 \sqrt{2}}{2}.$
Similarly, if we let $r = CR$ and $s = CS,$ then $rs = 36$ and $r + s = 12,$ so $r = s = 6.$  (By going through the calculations, we can also confirm that there is no bisecting line that intersects $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{BC}.$)
Let $X$ be the intersection of lines $PQ$ and $RS.$  Let $Y$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to $\overline{AC}.$

By the Law of Cosines on triangle $ABC,$
\[\cos A = \frac{7^2 + 9^2 - 8^2}{2 \cdot 7 \cdot 9} = \frac{11}{21}.\]Then
\[\sin A = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 A} = \frac{8 \sqrt{5}}{21},\]so
\begin{align*}
\tan \angle AQP &= \frac{PY}{QY} \\
&= \frac{AP \sin A}{AQ - AY} \\
&= \frac{AP \sin A}{AQ - AP \cos A} \\
&= \frac{\frac{12 - 3 \sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{8 \sqrt{5}}{21}}{\frac{12 + 3 \sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{12 - 3 \sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{11}{21}} \\
&= 3 \sqrt{10} - 4 \sqrt{5}.
\end{align*}Again by the Law of Cosines on triangle $ABC,$
\[\cos C = \frac{8^2 + 9^2 - 7^2}{2 \cdot 8 \cdot 9} = \frac{2}{3}.\]Then
\[\sin C = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 C} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}.\]Since $CR = CS,$
\begin{align*}
\tan \angle CRS &= \tan \left( 90^\circ - \frac{C}{2} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{\tan \frac{C}{2}} \\
&= \frac{\sin \frac{C}{2}}{1 - \cos \frac{C}{2}} \\
&= \frac{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}}{1 - \frac{2}{3}} \\
&= \sqrt{5}.
\end{align*}Finally,
\begin{align*}
\tan \theta &= \tan (180^\circ - \tan \angle AQP - \tan \angle CRS) \\
&= -\tan (\angle AQP + \angle CRS) \\
&= -\frac{\tan \angle AQP + \tan \angle CRS}{1 - \tan \angle AQP \tan \angle CRS} \\
&= -\frac{(3 \sqrt{10} - 4 \sqrt{5}) + \sqrt{5}}{1 - (3 \sqrt{10} - 4 \sqrt{5}) \sqrt{5}} \\
&= -\frac{3 \sqrt{10} - 3 \sqrt{5}}{21 - 15 \sqrt{2}} \\
Converting to degrees,
\[-\frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \cdot \left( -\frac{\pi}{2} \right) = -90^\circ.\]Then $\sin (-90^\circ) = -\sin 90^\circ = \boxed{-1}.$
We can write the given equation as
\[\frac{8 \sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = 3 \cos \theta.\]Then $8 \sin \theta = 3 \cos^2 \theta.$  Since $\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta,$
\[8 \sin \theta = 3 - 3 \sin^2 \theta.\]Then $3 \sin^2 \theta + 8 \sin \theta - 3 = 0,$ which factors as $(3 \sin \theta - 1)(\sin \theta + 3) = 0.$  Since $-1 \le \sin \theta \le 1,$ we must have $\sin \theta = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}.$
From the given equation,
\[\tan 2x = \sec 3x - \tan 3x = \frac{1}{\cos 3x} - \frac{\sin 3x}{\cos 3x} = \frac{1 - \sin 3x}{\cos 3x}.\]Recall the identity
\[\tan \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{1 - \cos \theta}{\sin \theta}.\]Thus,
\[\frac{1 - \sin 3x}{\cos 3x} = \frac{1 - \cos (\frac{\pi}{2} - 3x)}{\sin (\frac{\pi}{2} - 3x)} = \tan \left( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{3x}{2} \right),\]so
\[\tan 2x = \tan \left( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{3x}{2} \right).\]Since the tangent function has a period of $\pi,$
\[2x - \left( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{3x}{2} \right) = n \pi\]for some integer $n.$  Solving for $x,$ we find
\[x = \frac{(4n + 1) \pi}{14}.\]The smallest positive solution of this form, where $n$ is an integer, is $x = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{14}}.$
From the angle subtraction formula,
\[\tan (\alpha - \beta) = \frac{\tan \alpha - \tan \beta}{1 + \tan \alpha \tan \beta} = \frac{8 - 7}{1 + 8 \cdot 7} = \boxed{\frac{1}{57}}.\]
Let $t = \tan \theta.$  Then $\tan 2 \theta = \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}$ and $\tan 3 \theta = \frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2},$ so
\[t + \frac{2t}{1 - t^2} + \frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2} = 0.\]This simplifies to $4t^5 - 14t^3 + 6t = 0.$  This factors as $2t(2t^2 - 1)(t^2 - 3) = 0.$
Since $0^\circ < \theta < 45^\circ,$ $0 < t < 1.$  The only solution in this interval is $t = \boxed{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}.$
Let $\mathbf{R}$ be the matrix, let $\mathbf{v}$ be a vector, and let $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{R} \mathbf{v}.$  Then $\mathbf{R} \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{v},$ which means $\mathbf{R}^2 \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}.$  (In geometrical terms, if we reflect a vector, and reflect it again, then we get back the same vector as the original.)  Since this holds for all vectors $\mathbf{v},$
\[\mathbf{R}^2 = \mathbf{I}.\]Here,
\[\mathbf{R}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ -\frac{4}{5} & \frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ -\frac{4}{5} & \frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a^2 - \frac{4}{5} b & ab + \frac{3}{5} b \\ -\frac{4}{5} a - \frac{12}{25} & -\frac{4}{5} b + \frac{9}{25} \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, $-\frac{4}{5} a - \frac{12}{25} = 0$ and $-\frac{4}{5} b + \frac{9}{25} = 1.$  Solving, we find $(a,b) = \boxed{\left( -\frac{3}{5}, -\frac{4}{5} \right)}.$
As $t$ varies over all real numbers,
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix}\]takes on all points on a line with direction $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix}$, and as $s$ varies over all real numbers,
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} + s \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ k \end{pmatrix}\]takes on all points on a line with direction $\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ k \end{pmatrix}$.
If there are no solutions in $t$ and $s$ to the given equation, then geometrically, this means that the two lines do not intersect
This implies that the two lines are parallel
In turn, this means that the direction vector of one line is a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the other line
Hence, there exists a constant $c$ such that
\[\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix} = c \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ k \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -c \\ ck \end{pmatrix}.\]Then $-c = 4$, so $c = -4$
Also, $-7 = ck$, so $k = -\frac{7}{c} = \boxed{\frac{7}{4}}$.
Expanding $(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{c}) \times (\mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a}),$ we get
\begin{align*}
(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{c}) \times (\mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a}) &= \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a} \\
&= \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{0} + \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a} \\
&= \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a} \\
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot [(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{c}) \times (\mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a})] &= (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) \\
&= \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) + \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) \\
&\quad - \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}).
\end{align*}Since $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is orthogonal to $\mathbf{a},$ $\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = 0.$  Similarly, other dot products vanish, and we are left with
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}).\]From the scalar triple product, $\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}),$ so this becomes $\boxed{0}.$
We have that
\[\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 1 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 8 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 9 \\ -8 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
The average of $\frac{2 \pi}{11}$ and $\frac{15 \pi}{22}$ is $\frac{19 \pi}{44}.$  We can then write
\begin{align*}
10 e^{2 \pi i/11} + 10 e^{15 \pi i/22} &= 10 e^{19 \pi i/44} (e^{-\pi i/4} + e^{\pi i/4}) \\
&= 10 e^{19 \pi i/44} \left( \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} + \cos \frac{\pi}{4} - i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \\
&= 10 \sqrt{2} e^{19 \pi i/44}.
\end{align*}Thus, $(r, \theta) = \boxed{\left( 10 \sqrt{2}, \frac{19 \pi}{44} \right)}.$
Note that
\[\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ 7 & 2 \end{vmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(7) = 11,\]so the matrix scales the area of any region by a factor of 11
In particular, the area of $S'$ is $11 \cdot 4 = \boxed{44}.$
Let $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 16 \\ -17 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},$ and $\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -5 \\ 10 \end{pmatrix}.$  Then line $AB$ is parameterized by
\[\mathbf{a} + t (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) = \begin{pmatrix} 6 + 10t \\ -7 - 10t \\ 7 + 5t \end{pmatrix}.\]Also, line $CD$ is parameterized by
\[\mathbf{c} + s (\mathbf{d} - \mathbf{c}) = \begin{pmatrix} 2s \\ 3 - 8s \\ -6 + 16s \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, we want
\begin{align*}
6 + 10t &= 2s, \\
-7 - 10t &= 3 - 8s, \\
7 + 5t &= -6 + 16s.
\end{align*}Solving this system, we find $t = -\frac{7}{15}$ and $s = \frac{2}{3}.$  We can find the point of intersection as $\boxed{\left( \frac{4}{3}, -\frac{7}{3}, \frac{14}{3} \right)}.$
A projection matrix is always of the form
\[\begin{pmatrix} \cos^2 \theta & \cos \theta \sin \theta \\ \cos \theta \sin \theta & \sin^2 \theta \end{pmatrix},\]where the vector being projected onto has direction vector $\begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta \\ \sin \theta \end{pmatrix}.$  The determinant of this matrix is then
\[\cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \theta - (\cos \theta \sin \theta)^2 = \boxed{0}.\](Why does this make sense geometrically?)
Note that $\|\mathbf{a}\| = 5,$ so $\mathbf{b}$ is collinear with the midpoint of $\mathbf{a}$ and $5 \mathbf{v}.$  In other words,
\[\mathbf{b} = k \cdot \frac{\mathbf{a} + 5 \mathbf{v}}{2}\]for some scalar $k.$

\[(-2 - 3k)^2 + (2 - 4k)^2 + (-2)^2 = 25k^2.\]This simplifies to $k = 3.$  Hence,
\[\mathbf{v} = \frac{2 \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a}}{15} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -11/15 \\ -2/3 \\ -2/15 \end{pmatrix}}.\]

\[\begin{pmatrix} a & 1 & b \\ 2 & 2 & 3 \\ c & 5 & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -5 & e & -11 \\ 2 & -13 & 5 \\ 2 & h & 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5a + 2 + 2b & ae - 13 + bh & -11a + 5 + 4b \\ 0 & 2e - 26 + 3h & 0 \\ -5c + 10 + 2d & ce - 65 + dh & -11c + 25 + 4d \end{pmatrix}.\]This gives us $-5a + 2 + 2b = 1,$ $-11a + 5 + 4b = 0,$ $-5c + 10 + 2d = 0,$ and $-11c + 25 + 4d = 1.$  Solving these equations, we find $a = 3,$ $b = 7,$ $c = 4,$ and $d = 5.$
Hence, $3e - 13 + 7h = 0,$ $2e - 26 + 3h = 1,$ and $4e - 65 + 5h = 0.$  Solving, we find $e = 30$ and $h = -11.$
Therefore, $a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 3 + 7 + 4 + 5 + 30 + 2 + 5 + (-11) = \boxed{45}.$
The direction vector of the line is $\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix},$ and the normal vector to the plane is $\mathbf{n} = \begin{pmatrix} -10 \\ -2 \\ 11 \end{pmatrix}.$  Note that if $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{d}$ in the plane, then the angle between $\mathbf{d}$ and $\mathbf{n}$ is $90^\circ - \theta.$

The equation $f(x) = 0$ has five solutions in $[-2,2].$  For a fixed nonzero real number $y,$ where $-2 < y < 2,$ the equation $f(x) = y$ has four solutions in $[-2,2].$
We want to solve the equation
\[f(f(f(x))) = f(x).\]Let $a = f(x),$ so
\[a = f(f(a)).\]Let $b = f(a),$ so $a = f(b).$  Thus, both $(a,b)$ and $(b,a)$ lie on the graph of $y = f(x).$  In other words, $(a,b)$ lie on the graph of $y = f(x)$ and $x = f(y).$

Apart from the origin, there are 14 points of intersection, all of which have different $x$-coordinates, strictly between $-2$ and 2
So if we set $(a,b)$ to be one of these points of intersection, then $a = f(b)$ and $b = f(a).$  Also, the equation $f(x) = a$ will have four solutions.
For the origin, $a = b = 0.$  The equation $f(x) = 0$ has five solutions.
Therefore, the equation $f(f(f(x))) = f(x)$ has a total of $14 \cdot 4 + 5 = \boxed{61}$ solutions.
First, we compute $\cot (\tan^{-1} a).$  Let $x = \tan^{-1} a,$ so $a = \tan x.$  Then
\[\cot (\tan^{-1} a) = \cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x} = \frac{1}{a}.\]By the tangent addition formula,
\[\tan (\tan^{-1} a + \tan^{-1} b) = \frac{a + b}{1 - ab}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\cot (\cot^{-1} a + \cot^{-1} b) &= \frac{1}{\tan (\cot^{-1} a + \cot^{-1} b)} \\
&= \frac{1 - \tan (\cot^{-1} a) \tan (\cot^{-1} b)}{\tan (\cot^{-1} a) + \tan (\cot^{-1} b)} \\
&= \frac{1 - \frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{b}}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}} \\
&= \frac{ab - 1}{a + b}.
\end{align*}Hence,
\[\cot (\cot^{-1} 3 + \cot^{-1} 7) = \frac{3 \cdot 7 - 1}{3 + 7} = 2.\]Both $\cot^{-1} 3$ and $\cot^{-1} 7$ are acute angles, so $\cot^{-1} 3 + \cot^{-1} 7 = \cot^{-1} 2.$
\[\cot (\cot^{-1} 13 + \cot^{-1} 21) = \frac{13 \cdot 21 - 1}{13 + 21} = 8.\]Both $\cot^{-1} 13$ and $\cot^{-1} 21$ are acute angles, so $\cot^{-1} 3 + \cot^{-1} 7 = \cot^{-1} 8.$
Therefore,
\[\cot (\cot^{-1} 3 + \cot^{-1} 7 + \cot^{-1} 13 + \cot^{-1} 21) = \cot (\cot^{-1} 2 + \cot^{-1} 8) = \frac{2 \cdot 8 - 1}{2 + 8} = \boxed{\frac{3}{2}}.\]
Let $z = -x - \frac{\pi}{6}.$  Then $\frac{\pi}{6} \le z \le \frac{\pi}{4},$ and $\frac{\pi}{3} \le 2z \le \frac{\pi}{2}.$  Also,
\[\tan \left( x + \frac{2 \pi}{3} \right) = \tan \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - z \right) = \cot z,\]so
\begin{align*}
y &= \cot z + \tan z + \cos z \\
&= \frac{\cos z}{\sin z} + \frac{\sin z}{\cos z} + \cos z \\
&= \frac{\cos^2 z + \sin^2 z}{\sin z \cos z} + \cos z\\
&= \frac{1}{\sin z \cos z} + \cos z.
\end{align*}From the angle addition formula, $\sin 2z = \sin (z + z) = \sin z \cos z + \cos z \sin z = 2 \sin z \cos z,$ so
\[y = \frac{2}{2 \sin z \cos z} + \cos z = \frac{2}{\sin 2z} + \cos z.\]Note that $\sin 2z$ is increasing on the interval $\frac{\pi}{3} \le 2z \le \frac{\pi}{2},$ so $\frac{2}{\sin 2z}$ is decreasing
Furthermore, $\cos z$ is decreasing on the interval $\frac{\pi}{6} \le z \le \frac{\pi}{4}.$  Therefore, $y$ is a decreasing function, which means that the maximum occurs at $z = \frac{\pi}{6}.$  Thus, the maximum value is
\[\frac{2}{\sin \frac{\pi}{3}} + \cos \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}/2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \boxed{\frac{11 \sqrt{3}}{6}}.\]
We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} x & c & -b \\ -c & x & a \\ b & -a & x \end{vmatrix} &= x \begin{vmatrix} x & a \\ -a & x \end{vmatrix} - c \begin{vmatrix} -c & a \\ b & x \end{vmatrix} - b \begin{vmatrix} -c & x \\ b & -a \end{vmatrix} \\
&= x(x^2 + a^2) - c(-cx - ab) - b(ac - bx) \\
&= x(x^2 + a^2 + b^2 + c^2).
\end{align*}Since $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are nonzero, the equation $x^2 + a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 0$ has no real solutions
Therefore, there is only $\boxed{1}$ real solution, namely $x = 0.$
Use logarithm properties to obtain $\log_{10} (\sin x \cos x)= -1$, and then $\sin x \cos x = \frac{1}{10}$
Note that
\[(\sin x+\cos x)^2 = \sin^2 x +\cos^2 x+2\sin x\cos x=1+{2\over10}={12\over10}.\]Thus
\[2\log_{10} (\sin x+\cos x)= \log_{10} [(\sin x + \cos x)^2] = \log_{10} {12\over10}=\log_{10} 12-1,\]so
\[\log_{10} (\sin x+\cos x)={1\over2}(\log_{10} 12-1),\]and $n=\boxed{12}$.
Converting to degrees,
\[\frac{5 \pi}{3} = \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \cdot \frac{5 \pi}{3} = 300^\circ.\]Then
\[\sec 300^\circ = \frac{1}{\cos 300^\circ}.\]Since the cosine function has period $360^\circ,$
\[\cos 300^\circ = \cos (300^\circ - 360^\circ) = \cos (-60^\circ) = \cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2},\]so $\sec 300^\circ = \boxed{2}.$
Solution 1: Let $u = -2 + 3i$ and $v = 1 + i$, and let $z$ lie on the line joining $u$ and $v.$  Then
\[\frac{z - u}{v - u}\]is real
But a complex number is real if and only if it is equal to its conjugate, which gives us the equation
\[\frac{z - u}{v - u} = \frac{\overline{z} - \overline{u}}{\overline{v} - \overline{u}}.\]Substituting $u = -2 + 3i$ and $v = 1 + i$, we get
\[\frac{z + 2 - 3i}{3 - 2i} = \frac{\overline{z} + 2 + 3i}{3 + 2i}.\]Cross-multiplying, we get
\[(3 + 2i)(z + 2 - 3i) = (3 - 2i)(\overline{z} + 2 + 3i).\]This simplifies to
\[(3 + 2i) z + (-3 + 2i) = 10i.\]Multiplying both sides by $-i$, we get
\[(2 - 3i) z + (2 + 3i) \overline{z} = 10.\]Hence, $a = 2 - 3i$ and $b = 2 + 3i$, so $ab = (2 - 3i)(2 + 3i) = \boxed{13}$.
Solution 2: Substituting $z = -2 + 3i$ and $z = 1 + i$ in the given equation, we obtain the system of equations
\begin{align*}
(-2 + 3i) a + (-2 - 3i) b &= 10, \\
(1 + i) a + (1 - i) b &= 10.
\end{align*}Subtracting these equations, we get
\[(3 - 2i) a + (3 + 2i) b = 0,\]so
\[b = -\frac{3 - 2i}{3 + 2i} a.\]Substituting into the first equation, we get
\[(-2 + 3i) a - (-2 - 3i) \cdot \frac{3 - 2i}{3 + 2i} a = 10.\]Solving for $a$, we find $a = 2 - 3i.$  Then $b = 2 + 3i$, so $ab = (2 - 3i)(2 + 3i) = \boxed{13}$.
Note that the vector $\mathbf{p}$ must lie on the line passing through $\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}.$  This line can be parameterized by
\[\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \left( \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 7t - 5 \\ 2t + 1 \end{pmatrix}.\][asy]

The vector $\mathbf{p}$ itself will be orthogonal to the direction vector $\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},$ so
\[\begin{pmatrix} 7t - 5 \\ 2t + 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = 0.\]Hence, $(7t - 5)(7) + (2t + 1)(2) = 0.$  Solving, we find $t = \frac{33}{53}.$  Hence, $\mathbf{p} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -34/53 \\ 119/53 \end{pmatrix}}.$
The determinant $D$ is given by $\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}).$
Let $D'$ be the determinant of the matrix whose column vectors are $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b},$ $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c},$ and $\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}.$  Then
\[D' = (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \cdot ((\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) \times (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a})).\]By the vector triple product, for any vectors $\mathbf{p},$ $\mathbf{q},$ and $\mathbf{r},$
\[\mathbf{p} \times (\mathbf{q} \times \mathbf{r}) = (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{r}) \mathbf{q} - (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q}) \mathbf{r}.\]Then
\[(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) \times (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) = ((\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) \cdot \mathbf{a}) \mathbf{c} - ((\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{a}.\]Since $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}$ is orthogonal to $\mathbf{c},$ $(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) \cdot \mathbf{c} = 0,$ so $(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) \times (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) = ((\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) \cdot \mathbf{a}) \mathbf{c}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
D' &= (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \cdot ((\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) \cdot \mathbf{a}) \mathbf{c} \\
&= ((\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) \cdot \mathbf{a}) ((\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{c}) \\
&= D ((\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{c}).
\end{align*}By the scalar triple product, $(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = D,$ so $D' = D^2.$  Therefore, $(k,n) = \boxed{(1,2)}.$
Note that for any angle $x,$ from the angle subtraction formula,
\begin{align*}
(1 + \tan x)(1 + \tan (45^\circ - x)) &= (1 + \tan x) \left( 1 + \frac{\tan 45^\circ - \tan x}{1 + \tan 45^\circ \tan x} \right) \\
&= (1 + \tan x) \left( 1 + \frac{1 - \tan x}{1 + \tan x} \right) \\
&= 1 + \tan x + 1 - \tan x \\
\end{align*}Thus, taking $x = 1^\circ,$ $2^\circ,$ $\dots,$ $22^\circ,$ we get
\begin{align*}
(1 + \tan 1^\circ)(1 + \tan 44^\circ) &= 2, \\
(1 + \tan 2^\circ)(1 + \tan 43^\circ) &= 2, \\
&\dots, \\
(1 + \tan 22^\circ)(1 + \tan 23^\circ) &= 2.
\end{align*}Hence,
\[(1 + \tan 1^\circ)(1 + \tan 2^\circ)(1 + \tan 23^\circ) \dotsm (1 + \tan 44^\circ) = 2^{22}.\]Then
\[(1 + \tan 1^\circ)(1 + \tan 2^\circ)(1 + \tan 23^\circ) \dotsm (1 + \tan 44^\circ)(1 + \tan 45^\circ) = 2^{23},\]which means $n = \boxed{23}.$
Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$, we have $[ABM] = [ACM]$
Since $ADM$ is the reflection of $AEM$ over $\overline{AM}$, we have $[ADM] = [AEM]$ and $AD = AE = 6$
Similarly, we have $[C'DM] = [CEM]$ and $C'D = CE = 12$.
Since $[ABM]=[ACM]$ and $[ADM]=[AEM]$, we have $[ABM]-[ADM] = [ACM]-[AEM]$, so $[ABD] = [CEM]$
Combining this with $[CEM]=[C'DM]$ gives $[ABD] = [C'DM]$
Therefore,
\[\frac12(AD)(DB)\sin \angle ADB = \frac12 (C'D)(DM)\sin \angle C'DM.\]We have $\angle ADB  = \angle C'DM$, and substituting our known segment lengths in the equation above gives us $(6)(10)=(12)(DM)$, so $DM = 5$.

Now, we're almost there
We apply the Law of Cosines to $\triangle ADB$ to get
\[AB^2 = AD^2 + DB^2 - 2(AD)(DB)\cos \angle ADB.\]We have $\cos \angle ADB = \cos \angle C'DM$ since $\angle ADB = \angle C'DM$, and we can apply the Law of Cosines to find $\cos \angle C'DM$ (after noting that $C'M = CM = BM = 15$):
\begin{align*}
AB^2 &= AD^2 + DB^2 - 2(AD)(DB)\cos \angle ADB\\
&=36+100 - 2(6)(10)\left(\frac{225 - 144-25}{-2(5)(12)}\right)\\
&=136 + 56 = 192.
\end{align*}So, $AB = \sqrt{192} = \boxed{8\sqrt{3}}$.
Let $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ a \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} b \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ c \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},$ and $\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 6d \\ 6d \\ -d \end{pmatrix}.$  For these to be collinear, the following vectors must be proportional:
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} &= \begin{pmatrix} b - 1 \\ 1 \\ -a \end{pmatrix}, \\
\mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} &= \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ c \\ 1 - a \end{pmatrix}, \\
\mathbf{d} - \mathbf{a} &= \begin{pmatrix} 6d - 1 \\ 6d \\ -d - a \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}If the first two vectors are in proportion, then
\[\frac{1}{1 - b} = c = \frac{a - 1}{a}.\]If the first and third vectors are in proportion, then
\[\frac{6d - 1}{b - 1} = 6d = \frac{a + d}{a}.\]Since $\frac{1}{b - 1} = \frac{1 - a}{a},$ we can write
\[\frac{(6d - 1)(1 - a)}{a} = 6d = \frac{a + d}{a}.\]Clearing fractions gives
\begin{align*}
6ad &= a + d, \\
(6d - 1)(1 - a) &= a + d.
\end{align*}Adding these equations, we find $a + 6d - 1= 2a + 2d,$ which simplifies to $a = 4d - 1.$  Substituting into $6ad = a + d,$ we get
\[6(4d - 1)d = (4d - 1) + d.\]This simplifies to $24d^2 - 11d - 1 = 0,$ which factors as $(8d - 1)(3d - 1) = 0.$  Thus, the possible values of $d$ are $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{8}}.$
Note that $f(x)$ is defined only for $-1 \le x \le 1.$
First, we claim that $\arccos x + \arcsin x = \frac{\pi}{2}$ for all $x \in [-1,1].$
Note that
\[\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin x \right) = \cos (\arccos x) = x.\]Furthermore, $-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \arcsin x \le \frac{\pi}{2},$ so $0 \le \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin x \le \pi.$  Therefore,
\[\frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin x = \arccos x,\]so $\arccos x + \arcsin x = \frac{\pi}{2}.$
The range of $\arctan x$ on $[-1,1]$ is $\left[ -\frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right],$ so the range of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{\left[ \frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{3 \pi}{4} \right]}.$
We have that $r = \sqrt{1^2 + (-\sqrt{3})^2} = 2.$  Also, if we draw the line connecting the origin and $(1,-\sqrt{3}),$ this line makes an angle of $\frac{5 \pi}{3}$ with the positive $x$-axis.
unitsize(0.8 cm);
draw((-2.5,0)--(2.5,0));
draw((0,-2.5)--(0,2.5));
draw(arc((0,0),2,0,300),red,Arrow(6));
draw((0,0)--(1,-sqrt(3)));
dot((1,-sqrt(3)), red);
label("$(1,-\sqrt{3})$", (1,-sqrt(3)), NE);
dot((2,0), red);
[/asy]
Therefore, the polar coordinates are $\boxed{\left( 2, \frac{5 \pi}{3} \right)}.$
We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 + \sin \theta & 1 \\ 1 + \cos \theta & 1 & 1 \end{vmatrix} &= \begin{vmatrix} 1 + \sin \theta & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{vmatrix} - \begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 + \cos \theta & 1 \end{vmatrix} + \begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 + \sin \theta \\ 1 + \cos \theta & 1 \end{vmatrix} \\
&= ((1 + \sin \theta) - 1) - (1 - (1 + \cos \theta)) + (1 - (1 + \sin \theta)(1 + \cos \theta)) \\
&= -\cos \theta \sin \theta = -\frac{2 \cos \theta \sin \theta}{2} = -\frac{\sin 2 \theta}{2}.
\end{align*}The maximum value of the determinant is then $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
Expanding, we get
\[a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - c^2 = 3ab,\]so $a^2 - ab + b^2 = c^2.$
Then by the Law of Cosines,
\[\cos C = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} = \frac{ab}{2ab} = \frac{1}{2},\]so $C = \boxed{60^\circ}.$
From the first equation, using the double angle formula,
\[3 \sin^2 a = 1 - 2 \sin^2 b = \cos 2b.\]From the second equation, again using the double angle formula,
\[\sin 2b = \frac{3}{2} \sin 2a = 3 \cos a \sin a.\]Since $\cos^2 2b + \sin^2 2b = 1,$
\[9 \sin^4 a + 9 \cos^2 a \sin^2 a = 1.\]Then $9 \sin^2 a (\sin^2 a + \cos^2 a) = 1,$ so $\sin^2 a = \frac{1}{9}.$  Since $a$ is acute, $\sin a = \frac{1}{3}.$
\begin{align*}
\sin (a + 2b) &= \sin a \cos 2b + \cos a \sin 2b \\
&= (\sin a)(3 \sin^2 a) + (\cos a)(3 \cos a \sin a) \\
&= 3 \sin^3 a + 3 \cos^2 a \sin a \\
&= 3 \sin a (\sin^2 a + \cos^2 a) \\
\end{align*}Since $a$ and $b$ are acute, $0 < a + 2b < \frac{3 \pi}{2}.$  Therefore, $a + 2b = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{2}}.$
Because $\cos x =0$ and $\cos(x+z)=\frac{1}{2}$, it follows that $x= \frac{m\pi}{2}$ for some odd integer $m$ and $x+z=2n\pi \pm \frac{\pi}{3}$ for some integer $n$
Therefore
\[z = 2n\pi - \frac{m\pi}{2}\pm\frac{\pi}{3} = k\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}\pm\frac{\pi}{3}\]for some integer $k$
The smallest value of $k$ that yields a positive value for $z$ is 0, and the smallest positive value of $z$ is $\frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{3} = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{6}}$.
We find that
\[\mathbf{M}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\ b & c & a \\ c & a & b \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\ b & c & a \\ c & a & b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + b^2 + c^2 & ab + ac + bc & ab + ac + bc \\ ab + ac + bc  & a^2 + b^2 + c^2 & ab + ac + bc \\ ab + ac + bc & ab + ac + bc & a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \end{pmatrix}.\]Since this is equal to $\mathbf{I},$ we can say that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$ and $ab + ac + bc = 0.$
Recall the factorization
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc).\]We have that
\[(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc) = 1,\]so $a + b + c = \pm 1.$
If $a + b + c = 1,$ then
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) = 1,\]so $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc + 1 = 4.$
If $a + b + c = -1,$ then
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) = -1,\]so $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc - 1 = 2.$
Thus, the possible values of $a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ are $\boxed{2,4}.$
Suppose that vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ generate the parallelogram
Then the vectors corresponding to the diagonals are $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}.$
unitsize(0.4 cm);

B = (7,2);
C = (1,3);
D = B + C;
trans = (10,0);
draw(B--D--C);
draw(A--B,Arrow(6));
draw(A--C,Arrow(6));
draw(A--D,Arrow(6));
label("$\mathbf{a}$", (A + B)/2, SE);

label("$\mathbf{b}$", (A + C)/2 + trans, W);
label("$\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}$", (B + C)/2 + trans, N);
[/asy]
Thus, the vectors corresponding to the diagonals are $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.$  Then
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} = \frac{3}{3 \cdot 3} = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}.\]
Let $P$ be the plane $3x - y + 4z = 0.$  We can take $\mathbf{n} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector of plane $P.$
Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix},$ and let $\mathbf{p}$ be its projection onto plane $P.$  Note that $\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{p}$ is parallel to $\mathbf{n}.$

Thus, $\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{p}$ is the projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\mathbf{n}.$  Hence,
\[\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{p} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{13}{26} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3/2 \\ -1/2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.\]Then
\[\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{v} - \begin{pmatrix} 3/2 \\ -1/2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 5/2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
For all vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b},$ by the Triangle Inequality,
\[\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\| \le \|\mathbf{a}\| + \|\mathbf{b}\|.\]In particular,
\[\left\| \mathbf{v} + \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \le \|\mathbf{v}\| + \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\|.\]Therefore,
\[\|\mathbf{v}\| \ge \left\| \mathbf{v} + \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\| - \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = 8 - \sqrt{10}.\]Equality occurs when we take
\[\mathbf{v} = \frac{8 - \sqrt{10}}{\sqrt{10}} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix},\]so the smallest possible value of $\|\mathbf{v}\|$ is $\boxed{8 - \sqrt{10}}.$
Squaring both sides, we get
\[\sin^2 x + 2 \sin x \cos x + \cos x^2 = 2.\]Then $2 \sin x \cos x = 1,$ so $\sin 2x = 1.$  Since $0 \le x < 2 \pi,$ $2x = \frac{\pi}{2}$ or $2x = \frac{5 \pi}{2},$ so $x = \frac{\pi}{4}$ or $x = \frac{5 \pi}{4}.$  We check that only $\boxed{\frac{\pi}{4}}$ works.
By product-to-sum,
\[2 \sin a \cos b = \sin (a + b) + \sin (a - b) = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{4}\]and
\[2 \cos a \sin b = \sin (a + b) - \sin (a - b) = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}.\]Dividing these equations, we get
\[\frac{\sin a \cos b}{\cos a \sin b} = 5,\]which simplifies to $\frac{\tan a}{\tan b} = \boxed{5}.$
Let $\alpha = \angle BAE= \angle CAD$, and let $\beta=\angle EAD$
$${{BD}\over{DC}}= {{[ABD]}\over{[ADC]}} ={{\frac{1}{2} \cdot AB\cdot AD\sin \angle BAD}\over{\frac{1}{2} \cdot AD\cdot AC\sin \angle CAD}} ={{AB}\over{AC}}\cdot{{\sin(\alpha+\beta)}\over{\sin\alpha}}.$$Similarly, $${{BE}\over{EC}}={{AB}\over{AC}}\cdot{{\sin \angle BAE}\over{\sin \angle CAE}}= {{AB}\over{AC}} \cdot{{\sin\alpha} \over{\sin(\alpha+\beta)}},$$and so $${{BE}\over{EC}}={{AB^2\cdot DC}\over{AC^2\cdot BD}}.$$Substituting the given values yields $BE/EC=(13^2\cdot6)/(14^2\cdot9)=169/294$
Therefore,
\[BE= \frac{15\cdot169}{169+294}= \boxed{\frac{2535}{463}}.\][asy]

Note that vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ are orthogonal, so
\[\|\mathbf{c}\| = \|\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|.\]Also, $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,$ so
\[3 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 5 \sin \theta.\]Hence, $\sin \theta = \boxed{\frac{3}{5}}.$
By the Law of Sines,
\[\frac{AB}{\sin C} = \frac{AC}{\sin B},\]so
\[\sin C = \frac{AB \sin B}{AC} = \frac{150 \sin 30^\circ}{50 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.\]Hence, $C = 60^\circ$ or $C = 120^\circ.$
If $C = 60^\circ,$ then $A = 180^\circ - 30^\circ - 60^\circ = 90^\circ.$  Then by Pythagoras,
\[BC = \sqrt{150^2 + (50 \sqrt{3})^2} = 100 \sqrt{3}.\]if $C = 120^\circ,$ then $A = 180^\circ - 30^\circ - 120^\circ = 30^\circ.$  Then by the Law of Cosines,
\[BC = \sqrt{150^2 + (50 \sqrt{3})^2 - 2 \cdot 150 \cdot 50 \sqrt{3} \cdot \cos 30^\circ} = 50 \sqrt{3}.\]Thus, the sum of all possible values of $BC$ is $\boxed{150 \sqrt{3}}.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
&\left( 1 - \frac{1}{\cos 23^\circ} \right) \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\sin 67^\circ} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\sin 23^\circ} \right) \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\cos 67^\circ} \right) \\
&= \frac{\cos 23^\circ - 1}{\cos 23^\circ} \cdot \frac{\sin 67^\circ + 1}{\sin 67^\circ} \cdot \frac{\sin 23^\circ - 1}{\sin 23^\circ} \cdot \frac{\cos 67^\circ + 1}{\cos 67^\circ} \\
&= \frac{1 - \cos 23^\circ}{\cos 23^\circ} \cdot \frac{1 + \sin 67^\circ}{\sin 67^\circ} \cdot \frac{1 - \sin 23^\circ}{\sin 23^\circ} \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 67^\circ}{\cos 67^\circ} \\
&= \frac{1 - \cos 23^\circ}{\cos 23^\circ} \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 23^\circ}{\cos 23^\circ} \cdot \frac{1 - \sin 23^\circ}{\sin 23^\circ} \cdot \frac{1 + \sin 23^\circ}{\sin 23^\circ} \\
&= \frac{(1 - \cos^2 23^\circ)(1 - \sin^2 23^\circ)}{\cos^2 23^\circ \sin^2 23^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\sin^2 23^\circ \cos^2 23^\circ}{\cos^2 23^\circ \sin^2 23^\circ} \\
&= \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
Since the vectors are orthogonal, their dot product is 0, which gives us
\[(3)(2) + (p)(1) + (-1)(q) = 0.\]Then $p - q = -6.$
Since the vectors have equal magnitudes,
\[3^2 + p^2 + (-1)^2 = 2^2 + 1^2 + q^2.\]Then $p^2 - q^2 = -5.$  This factors as $(p + q)(p - q) = -5,$ so
\[p + q = \frac{5}{6}.\]We can then solve the system, to obtain $(p,q) = \boxed{\left( -\frac{31}{12}, \frac{41}{12} \right)}.$
From the given equation,
\[\tan \left( \arctan \frac{1}{x} + \arctan \frac{1}{x^3} \right) = \tan \frac{\pi}{4} = 1.\]Then from the addition formula for tangent,
\[\frac{\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^3}}{1 - \frac{1}{x} \cdot \frac{1}{x^3}} = 1,\]or
\[\frac{x^3 + x}{x^4 - 1} = 1.\]Hence, $x^4 - 1 = x^3 + x,$ or $x^4 - x^3  - x - 1 = 0.$  We can factor this as
\begin{align*}
(x^4 - 1) - (x^3 + x) &= (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) - x(x^2 +1) \\
&= (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - x - 1).
\end{align*}The factor $x^2 + 1$ has no real roots, so $x^2 - x - 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,
\[x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]If $x = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2},$ then $x$ is negative, so
\[\arctan \frac{1}{x} + \arctan \frac{1}{x^3}\]is negative
Therefore, $x = \boxed{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}.$
From the angle addition formula,
\begin{align*}
\cos 75^\circ &= \cos (45^\circ + 30^\circ) \\
&= \cos 45^\circ \cos 30^\circ - \sin 45^\circ \sin 30^\circ \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}}.
\end{align*}

\[\cot B = -\cot \angle ABP = -\frac{y}{x + y},\]and
\[\cot C = \frac{2x + y}{x + y}.\]Hence,
\[|\cot B - \cot C| = \left| -\frac{2x + 2y}{x + y} \right| = \boxed{2}.\]
From the first equation, $\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0},$ so
\[(\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}.\]This tells us that the vectors $\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a}$ are parallel, so $\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{b}$ is of the form $t \mathbf{a}.$  Thus, $\mathbf{v} = t \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}.$
From the second equation, $\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{0},$ so
\[(\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{0}.\]This tells us that the vectors $\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are parallel, so $\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{a}$ is of the form $s \mathbf{b}.$  Thus, $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{a} + s \mathbf{b}.$
Therefore, $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}}.$
Since $\sin \left( -\frac{\pi}{3} \right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},$ $\arcsin \left( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) = \boxed{-\frac{\pi}{3}}.$
By the Law of Cosines, the cosine of one angle is
\[\frac{2^2 + (1 + \sqrt{3})^2 - (\sqrt{6})^2}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot (1 + \sqrt{3})} = \frac{2 + 2 \sqrt{3}}{4 + 4 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{2},\]so this angle is $\boxed{60^\circ}.$
The cosine of another angle is
\[\frac{(1 + \sqrt{3})^2 + (\sqrt{6})^2 - 2^2}{2 (1 + \sqrt{3})(\sqrt{6})} = \frac{6 + 2 \sqrt{3}}{6 \sqrt{2} + 2 \sqrt{6}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\]so this angle is $\boxed{45^\circ}.$
Then the third angle is $180^\circ - 60^\circ - 45^\circ = \boxed{75^\circ}.$

Then from right triangle $APQ,$
\[\tan \angle APQ = \frac{16}{x}.\]From right triangle $DPQ,$
\[\tan \angle DPQ = \frac{8}{x}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\tan \angle APD &= \tan (\angle APQ + \angle DPQ) \\
&= \frac{\tan \angle APQ + \tan \angle DPQ}{1 - \tan \angle APQ \cdot \tan \angle DPQ} \\
&= \frac{\frac{16}{x} + \frac{8}{x}}{1 - \frac{16}{x} \cdot \frac{8}{x}} \\
&= \frac{24x}{x^2 - 128} = 3.
\end{align*}Hence, $x^2 - 128 = 8x,$ or $x^2 - 8x - 128 = 0.$  This factors as $(x - 16)(x + 8) = 0,$ so $x = \boxed{16}.$
By the Law of Sines,
\[\frac{27}{\sin A} = \frac{48}{\sin 3A}.\]Then $\frac{\sin 3A}{\sin A} = \frac{48}{27},$ or
\[3 - 4 \sin^2 A = \frac{16}{9}.\]Hence, $\sin^2 A = \frac{11}{36},$ so $\sin A = \frac{\sqrt{11}}{6}.$  Also,
\[\cos^2 A = 1 - \frac{11}{36} = \frac{25}{36}.\]Since $A = \frac{C}{3} < 60^\circ,$ $\cos A = \frac{5}{6}.$
Then again by the Law of Sines,
\[\frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{a}{\sin A},\]so
\begin{align*}
b &= \frac{a \sin B}{\sin A} \\
&= \frac{27 \sin (180^\circ - 4A)}{\sin A} \\
&= \frac{27 \sin 4A}{\sin A} \\
&= \frac{27 \cdot 2 \sin 2A \cos 2A}{\sin A} \\
&= \frac{27 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \sin A \cos A \cdot (2 \cos^2 A - 1)}{\sin A} \\
&= 27 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cos A \cdot (2 \cos^2 A - 1) \\
&= \boxed{35}.
\end{align*}
We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} 1 + a & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 + b & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 + c \end{vmatrix} &= (1 + a) \begin{vmatrix} 1 + b & 1 \\ 1 & 1 + c \end{vmatrix} - \begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 + c \end{vmatrix} + \begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 + b \\ 1 & 1 \end{vmatrix} \\
&= (1 + a)((1 + b)(1 + c) - 1) - ((1)(1 + c) - 1) + (1 - (1 + b)) \\
&= abc + ab + ac + bc.
\end{align*}By Vieta's formulas, $ab + ac + bc = p$ and $abc = -q,$ so
\[abc + ab + ac + bc = \boxed{p - q}.\]
For the first line, we can write $P$ as$(2t + 3, -2t - 1, t + 2).$  For the second line, we can write $Q$ as $(s, 2s, -s + 4).$
\begin{align*}
PQ^2 &= ((2t + 3) - (s))^2 + ((-2t - 1) - (2s))^2 + ((t + 2) - (-s + 4))^2 \\
&= 6s^2 + 6st + 9t^2 - 6s + 12t + 14.
\end{align*}The terms $6st$ and $9t^2$ suggest the expansion of $(s + 3t)^2.$  And if we expand $(s + 3t + 2)^2,$ then we can also capture the term of $12t$:
\[(s + 3t + 2)^2 = s^2 + 6st + 9t^2 + 4s + 12t + 4.\]Thus,
\begin{align*}
PQ^2 &= (s + 3t + 2)^2 + 5s^2 - 10s + 10 \\
&= (s + 3t + 2)^2 + 5(s^2 - 2s + 1) + 5 \\
&= (s + 3t + 2)^2 + 5(s - 1)^2 + 5.
\end{align*}This tells us that $PQ^2 \ge 5.$  Equality occurs when $s + 3t + 2 = s - 1 = 0,$ or $s = 1$ and $t = -1.$  Thus, the minimum value of $PQ$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{5}}.$
Consider a right triangle with legs 2 and 5.
unitsize(1 cm);
draw((0,0)--(5,0)--(5,2)--cycle);
draw((4.8,0)--(4.8,0.2)--(5,0.2));
label("$5$", (5/2,0), S);
label("$2$", (5,1), E);
[/asy]
One angle of the triangle is $\frac{\pi}{2},$ and the other two angles are $\arctan \frac{2}{5}$ and $\arctan \frac{5}{2}.$  Therefore,
\[\arctan \frac{2}{5} + \arctan \frac{5}{2} = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{2}}.\]
We have that
\begin{align*}
\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{\sin \theta} - \frac{\sin \theta}{1 + \cos \theta} &= \frac{(1 - \cos \theta)(1 + \cos \theta) - \sin^2 \theta}{\sin \theta (1 + \cos \theta)} \\
&= \frac{1 - \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta}{\sin \theta (1 + \cos \theta)} \\
&= \boxed{0}.
\end{align*}
From the double angle formula,
\[\frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2} + \frac{1 - \cos 4x}{2} + \frac{1 - \cos 6x}{2} + \frac{1 - \cos 8x}{2} = 2,\]so $\cos 2x + \cos 4x + \cos 6x + \cos 8x = 0.$  Then by sum-to-product,
\[\cos 2x + \cos 8x = 2 \cos 5x \cos 3x\]and
\[\cos 4x + \cos 6x = 2 \cos 5x \cos x,\]so
\[2 \cos 5x \cos 3x + 2 \cos 5x \cos x= 0,\]or $\cos 5x (\cos x + \cos 3x) = 0.$
Again by sum-to-product, $\cos x + \cos 3x = 2 \cos 2x \cos x,$ so this reduces to
\[\cos x \cos 2x \cos 5x = 0.\]Thus, $a + b + c = 1 + 2 + 5 = \boxed{8}.$
Note that
\begin{align*}
\|\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{w}} \mathbf{v}\| &= \left\| \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|^2} \mathbf{w} \right\| \\
&= \frac{|\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}|}{\|\mathbf{w}\|^2} \cdot \|\mathbf{w}\| \\
&= \frac{|\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}|}{\|\mathbf{w}\|} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{10}{7}}.
\end{align*}
We can assume that the square base is centered at $(0,0,0).$  All the vertices of the base lie on a circle with radius $\frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = 5 \sqrt{2},$ so we can assume that the vertices of the base are
\begin{align*}
A &= (5 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta, 5 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta), \\
B &= (-5 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta, 5 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta), \\
C &= (-5 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta, -5 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta), \\
D &= (5 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta, -5 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta).
\end{align*}The vertices of the cut are then at
\begin{align*}
E &= \left( 5 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta, 5 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta, \frac{35 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta - 20 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta + 25}{4} \right), \\
F &= \left( -5 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta, 5 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta, \frac{35 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta + 20 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta + 25}{4} \right), \\
G &= \left( -5 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta, -5 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta, \frac{-35 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta + 20 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta + 25}{4} \right), \\
H &= \left( 5 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta, -5 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta, \frac{-35 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta - 20 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta + 25}{4} \right).
\end{align*}Note that quadrilateral $EFGH$ is a parallelogram
The center of the parallelogram is
\[M = \left( 0, 0, \frac{25}{4} \right).\]The area of triangle $EMF$ is then given by $\frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{ME} \times \overrightarrow{MF}\|.$  We have that
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow{ME} \times \overrightarrow{MF} &= \left( 5 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta, 5 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta, \frac{35 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta - 20 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta}{4} \right) \times \left( -5 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta, 5 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta, \frac{35 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta + 20 \sqrt{2} \sin \theta}{4} \right) \\
&= \left( 50 \cos^2 \theta + 50 \sin^2 \theta, -\frac{175}{2} \cos^2 \theta - \frac{175}{2} \sin^2 \theta, 50 \cos^2 \theta + 50 \sin^2 \theta \right) \\
&= \left( 50, -\frac{175}{2}, 50 \right),
\end{align*}so the area of triangle $EMF$ is
\[\frac{1}{2} \left\| \left( 50, -\frac{175}{2}, 50 \right) \right\| = \frac{225}{4}.\]Therefore, the area of parallelogram $EFGH$ is $4 \cdot \frac{225}{4} = \boxed{225}.$  In particular, the area of the planar cut does not depend on the orientation of the prism.
We have that
\[\sec (-300^\circ) = \frac{1}{\cos (-300^\circ)}.\]Since the cosine function has period $360^\circ,$
\[\cos (-300^\circ) = \cos (-300^\circ + 360^\circ) = \cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2},\]so
\[\frac{1}{\cos (-300^\circ)} = \boxed{2}.\]
Suppose that vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ generate the parallelogram
Then the vectors corresponding to the diagonals are $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}.$

label("$\mathbf{b}$", (A + C)/2 + trans, W);
label("$\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}$", (B + C)/2 + trans, N);
[/asy]
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} &= \mathbf{p} + 2 \mathbf{q}, \\
\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} &= 2 \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q}.
\end{align*}Solving for $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b},$ we find
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{a} &= \frac{\mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}}{2}, \\
\mathbf{b} &= \frac{3 \mathbf{p} + 3 \mathbf{q}}{2}.
\end{align*}The area of the parallelogram is then given by
\begin{align*}
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| &= \left\| \frac{\mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}}{2} \times \frac{3 \mathbf{p} + 3 \mathbf{q}}{2} \right\| \\
&= \frac{3}{4} \| (\mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}) \times (\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q}) \| \\
&= \frac{3}{4} \|\mathbf{q} \times \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q} \times \mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{p} - \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{q} \| \\
&= \frac{3}{4} \|-\mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{q} + \mathbf{0} - \mathbf{0} - \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{q} \| \\
&= \frac{3}{4} \|-2 \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{q}\| \\
&= \frac{3}{2} \|\mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{q}\|
\end{align*}Since $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are unit vectors, and the angle between them is $30^\circ,$
\[\|\mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{q}\| = \|\mathbf{p}\| \|\mathbf{q}\| \sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2}.\]Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is $\frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.$
If the points $(0,0,0),$ $(1,a,0),$ $(0,1,a),$ and $(a,0,1)$ are coplanar, then the parallelepiped generated by the corresponding vectors $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ a \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},$ $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ a \end{pmatrix},$ and $\begin{pmatrix} a \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ has a volume of 0
\[\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 0 & a \\ a & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & a & 1 \end{vmatrix} = 0.\]Expanding the determinant, we get
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 0 & a \\ a & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & a & 1 \end{vmatrix} &= 1 \begin{vmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ a & 1 \end{vmatrix} + a \begin{vmatrix} a & 1 \\ 0 & a \end{vmatrix} \\
&= 1((1)(1) - (0)(a)) + a((a)(a) - (1)(0)) \\
&= a^3 + 1.
\end{align*}Then $a^3 + 1 = 0,$ so $a = \boxed{-1}.$
We have that
\[\begin{vmatrix} 7 & 3 \\ -1 & 2 \end{vmatrix} = (7)(2) - (3)(-1) = \boxed{17}.\]
Since $\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x,$ we can write
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= \frac{\sin^3 x + 6 \sin^2 x + \sin x + 2(1 - \sin^2 x) - 8}{\sin x - 1} \\
&= \frac{\sin^3 x + 4 \sin^2 x + \sin x - 6}{\sin x - 1} \\
&= \frac{(\sin x - 1)(\sin x + 2)(\sin x + 3)}{\sin x - 1} \\
&= (\sin x + 2)(\sin x + 3) \\
&= \sin^2 x + 5 \sin x + 6.
\end{align*}Let $y = \sin x.$  Then
\[\sin^2 x + 5 \sin x + 6 = y^2 + 5y + 6 = \left( y + \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{1}{4}\]Note that $y = \sin x$ satisfies $-1 \le y \le 1,$ and $\left( y + \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{1}{4}$ is increasing on this interval
Therefore,
\[2 \le (\sin x + 2)(\sin x + 3) \le 12.\]However, in the original function $f(x),$ $\sin x$ cannot take on the value of 1, so the range of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{[2,12)}.$
Let $z = \text{cis } \theta$
\[z^7 = \text{cis } 7 \theta.\]Using cis notation,
\[-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} = \text{cis } 225^\circ,\]so we want
\[\text{cis } 7 \theta = \text{cis } 225^\circ.\]This equation holds if and only if
\[7 \theta = 225^\circ + 360^\circ k\]for some integer $k$, or
\[\theta = \frac{225^\circ + 360^\circ k}{7}.\][asy]

The angles of this form that are between $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ are
\[\frac{225^\circ}{7}, \quad \frac{225^\circ + 360^\circ}{7}, \quad \frac{225^\circ + 2 \cdot 360^\circ}{7}, \quad \dots, \quad \frac{225^\circ + 6 \cdot 360^\circ}{7}.\]By the formula for an arithmetic series, the sum of these angles is
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot \left( \frac{225^\circ}{7} + \frac{225^\circ + 6 \cdot 360^\circ}{7} \right) \cdot 7 = \boxed{1305^\circ}.\]
We can write
\[\cot 10 + \tan 5 = \frac{\cos 10}{\sin 10} + \frac{\sin 5}{\cos 5} = \frac{\cos 10 \cos 5 + \sin 5 \sin 10}{\sin 10 \cos 5}.\]From the angle subtraction formula, the numerator is equal to $\cos (10 - 5) = \cos 5,$ so
\[\frac{\cos 10 \cos 5 + \sin 5 \sin 10}{\sin 10 \cos 5} = \frac{\cos 5}{\sin 10 \cos 5} = \boxed{\csc 10}.\]
We have that
\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^3 &= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}.}

Let $O = (0,0,1)$ be the center of the sphere, and let $X = (x,y,0)$ be a point on the boundary of the shadow
Since $X$ is on the boundary, $\overline{PX}$ is tangent to the sphere; let $T$ be the point of tangency
Note that $\angle PTO = 90^\circ.$  Also, lengths $OP$ and $OT$ are fixed, so $\angle OPT = \angle OPX$ is constant for all points $X$ on the boundary.

If we take $X = (0,-1,0)$ and $T = (0,-1,1),$ we see that $\angle OPX = 45^\circ.$  Hence, the angle between $\overrightarrow{PX}$ and $\overrightarrow{PO}$ is $45^\circ.$  This means
\[\frac{\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y + 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y + 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} = \cos 45^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.\]Then
\[\frac{(y + 1)(1) + (-2)(-1)}{\sqrt{x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + (-2)^2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\]or $y + 3 = \sqrt{x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + 4}.$  Squaring both sides, we get
\[y^2 + 6y + 9 = x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + 4.\]Solving for $y,$ we find $y = \frac{x^2}{4} - 1.$  Thus, $f(x) = \boxed{\frac{x^2}{4} - 1}.$
In rectangular coordinates, $\left( 5, \frac{3 \pi}{2} \right)$ becomes

The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $CD = \sqrt{BC^2 - BD^2} = \sqrt{81 - 16} = \sqrt{65}$, so $\sin B = \frac{CD}{BC} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{65}}{9}}$.
First, we must solve
\[\frac{x}{x - 1} = \sec^2 t.\]Solving for $x,$ we find $x = \frac{\sec^2 t}{\sec^2 t - 1}.$  Then
\[f(\sec^2 t) = \frac{1}{x} = \frac{\sec^2 t - 1}{\sec^2 t} = 1 - \cos^2 t = \boxed{\sin^2 t}.\]
At time $t = k,$ the particle is at
\[(2k + 7, 4k - 13).\]At time $t = k + 1,$ the particle is at
\[(2(k + 1) + 7, 4(k + 1) - 13).\]The change in the $x$-coordinate is 2, and the change in the $y$-coordinate is 4, so the speed of the particle is $\sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{20} = \boxed{2 \sqrt{5}}.$
Since $\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$ is its own inverse,
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{I}.\]This gives us
\[\begin{pmatrix} 9 - c & -d - 3 \\ cd + 3c & d^2 - c \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{I}.\]Then $9 - c = 1,$ $-d - 3 = 0,$ $cd + 3c = 0,$ and $d^2 - c = 1.$  Solving, we find $(c,d) = \boxed{(8,-3)}.$
Squaring both sides, we get
\[\sin^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{2n} \right) + 2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2n} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2n} \right) + \cos^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{2n} \right) = \frac{n}{4},\]which we can re-write as
\[\sin \frac{\pi}{n} + 1 = \frac{n}{4},\]so
\[\sin \frac{\pi}{n} = \frac{n}{4} - 1.\]Since $-1 \le \sin \frac{\pi}{n} \le 1,$ we must also have $-1 \le \frac{n}{4} - 1 \le 1,$ which is equivalent to $0 \le n \le 8.$
The integer $n$ cannot be 0, so $1 \le n \le 8,$ which means $\sin \frac{\pi}{n}$ is positive
Hence, $5 \le n \le 8.$
Note that $n = 6$ works:
\[\sin \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{4} - 1.\]Furthermore, $\sin \frac{\pi}{n}$ is a decreasing function of $n,$ and $\frac{n}{4} - 1$ is an increasing function of $n,$ so $n = \boxed{6}$ is the unique solution.
Since $\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1,$ the given equation reduces to
\[\sin^2 x = 0,\]so $\sin x = 0.$  This occurs exactly $x = k \pi$ for some integer $k.$  Then $-19 < k \pi < 98,$ or
\[-\frac{19}{\pi} < k < \frac{98}{\pi}.\]Since $-\frac{19}{\pi} \approx -6.05$ and $\frac{98}{\pi} \approx 31.19,$ the possible values of $k$ are $-6,$ $-5,$ $\dots,$ 31, giving us a total of $31 - (-6) + 1 = \boxed{38}$ solutions.
Solving for $x$ and $y,$ we find
\[x = \frac{11t - 1}{3}, \quad y = \frac{5t + 5}{3}.\]From the first equation,
\[t = \frac{3x + 1}{11}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
y &= \frac{5t + 5}{3} \\
&= \frac{5 \cdot \frac{3x + 1}{11} + 5}{3} \\
&= \frac{5}{11} x + \frac{20}{11},
\end{align*}Thus, the slope of the line is $\boxed{\frac{5}{11}}.$
From $\cos (a + b) = \cos a + \cos b,$ $\cos a = \cos (a + b) - \cos b.$  Then from sum-to-product,
\[\cos (a + b) - \cos b = -2 \sin \frac{a + 2b}{2} \sin \frac{a}{2}.\]Let $k = \sin \frac{a + 2b}{2},$ so
\[\cos a = -2k \sin \frac{a}{2}.\]Then
\[\cos^2 a = 4k^2 \sin^2 \frac{a}{2} = 4k^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - \cos a) = 2k^2 (1 - \cos a),\]so
\[\frac{\cos^2 a}{1 - \cos a} = 2k^2 \le 2.\]Then $\cos^2 a \le 2 - 2 \cos a,$ so
\[\cos^2 a + 2 \cos a + 1 \le 3.\]This means $(\cos a + 1)^2 \le 3,$ so $\cos a + 1 \le \sqrt{3},$ or $\cos a \le \sqrt{3} - 1.$
Equality occurs if we take $a = \arccos (\sqrt{3} - 1)$ and $b = \frac{3 \pi - a}{2}$ (which will make $k = \sin \frac{a + 2b}{2} = -1$), so the maximum value of $\cos a$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{3} - 1}.$
If $z^8 - z^6 + z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0,$ then
\[(z^2 + 1)(z^8 - z^6 + z^4 - z^2 + 1) = z^{10} + 1 = 0.\]So $z^{10} = -1 = \operatorname{cis} 180^\circ,$ which means
\[z = 18^\circ + \frac{360^\circ \cdot k}{10} = 18^\circ + 36^\circ \cdot k\]for some integer $k.$  Furthermore, $z^2 \neq -1.$  Thus, the roots $z$ are graphed below, labelled in black.

The roots with the maximum imaginary part are $\operatorname{cis} 54^\circ$ and $\operatorname{cis} 126^\circ,$ so $\theta = \boxed{54^\circ}.$
By the Binomial Theorem,
\begin{align*}
(1 + i \sqrt{3})^{1990} &= \binom{1990}{0} + \binom{1990}{1} (i \sqrt{3}) + \binom{1990}{2} (i \sqrt{3})^2 + \binom{1990}{3} (i \sqrt{3})^3 + \binom{1990}{4} (i \sqrt{3})^4 + \dots + \binom{1990}{1990} (i \sqrt{3})^{1990} \\
&= \binom{1990}{0} + i \binom{1990}{1} \sqrt{3} - 3 \binom{1990}{2} + 3i \sqrt{3} \binom{1990}{3} + 3^2 \binom{1990}{4} + \dots - 3^{995} \binom{1990}{1990}.
\end{align*}Thus, $\sum_{n = 0}^{1995} (-3)^n \binom{1990}{2n}$ is the real part of $(1 + i \sqrt{3})^{1990}.$
By DeMoivre's Theorem,
\begin{align*}
(1 + i \sqrt{3})^{1990} &= (2 \operatorname{cis} 60^\circ)^{1990} \\
&= 2^{1990} \operatorname{cis} 119400^\circ \\
&= 2^{1990} \operatorname{cis} 240^\circ \\
&= 2^{1990} \left( -\frac{1}{2} - i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right).
\end{align*}Therefore,
\[\frac{1}{2^{1990}} \sum_{n = 0}^{995} (-3)^n \binom{1990}{2n} = \boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}.\]
The side length of the regular tetrahedron is the distance between $(0,1,2)$ and $(4,2,1),$ which is
\[\sqrt{(0 - 4)^2 + (1 - 2)^2 + (2 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{18} = 3 \sqrt{2}.\]So if $(x,y,z)$ is the fourth vertex, with integer coordinates, then
\begin{align*}
x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2 &= 18, \\
(x - 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z - 1)^2 &= 18, \\
(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 5)^2 &= 18.
\end{align*}Subtracting the first and third equations, we get $6x + 6z - 30 = 0$, so $x + z = 5,$ which means $z = 5 - x.$  Subtracting the first and second equation, we get $8x + 2y - 2z - 16 = 0,$ so
\[y = z - 4x + 8 = (5 - x) - 4x + 8 = 13 - 5x.\]Substituting into the first equation, we get
\[x^2 + (12 - 5x)^2 + (3 - x)^2 = 18.\]This simplifies to $27x^2 - 126x + 135 = 0,$ which factors as $9(x - 3)(3x - 5) = 0.$  Since $x$ is an integer, $x = 3.$  Then $y = -2$ and $z = 2.$  Thus, the fourth vertex is $\boxed{(3,-2,2)}.$
By the Law of Cosines, the third side is
\[\sqrt{7^2 +  8^2 - 2 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 \cos 120^\circ} = \sqrt{7^2 + 8^2 + 7 \cdot 8} = \boxed{13}.\]
First, we claim that $\arccos x + \arcsin x = \frac{\pi}{2}$ for all $x \in [-1,1].$
Note that
\[\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin x \right) = \cos (\arccos x) = x.\]Furthermore, $-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \arcsin x \le \frac{\pi}{2},$ so $0 \le \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin x \le \pi.$  Therefore,
\[\frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin x = \arccos x,\]so $\arccos x + \arcsin x = \frac{\pi}{2}.$
In particular,
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= \left( \arccos \frac{x}{2} \right)^2 + \pi \arcsin \frac{x}{2} - \left( \arcsin \frac{x}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{\pi^2}{12} (x^2 + 6x + 8) \\
&= \left( \arccos \frac{x}{2} \right)^2 - \left( \arcsin \frac{x}{2} \right)^2 + \pi \arcsin \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\pi^2}{12} (x^2 + 6x + 8) \\
&= \left( \arccos \frac{x}{2} + \arcsin \frac{x}{2} \right) \left( \arccos \frac{x}{2} - \arcsin \frac{x}{2} \right) + \pi \arcsin \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\pi^2}{12} (x^2 + 6x + 8) \\
&= \frac{\pi}{2} \arccos \frac{x}{2} - \frac{\pi}{2} \arcsin \frac{x}{2} + \pi \arcsin \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\pi^2}{12} (x^2 + 6x + 8) \\
&= \frac{\pi}{2} \arccos \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\pi}{2} \arcsin \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\pi^2}{12} (x^2 + 6x + 8) \\
&= \frac{\pi^2}{4} + \frac{\pi^2}{12} (x^2 + 6x + 8) \\
&= \frac{\pi^2}{6} + \frac{\pi^2}{12} (x + 3)^2.
\end{align*}The function $f(x)$ is defined for $-2 \le x \le 2,$ so the range is $\boxed{\left[ \frac{\pi^2}{4}, \frac{9 \pi^2}{4} \right]}.$
By constructing a right triangle with adjacent side 1, opposite side 7, and hypotenuse $\sqrt{1^2 + 7^2} = 5 \sqrt{2}$, we see that
\[\cos \angle AOC = \frac{1}{5 \sqrt{2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \sin \angle AOC = \frac{7}{5 \sqrt{2}}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\cos \angle AOB &= \cos (\angle AOC + \angle BOC) \\
&= \cos \angle AOC \cos \angle BOC - \sin \angle AOC \sin \angle BOC \\
&= \frac{1}{5 \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{7}{5 \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&= -\frac{3}{5}.
\end{align*}Taking the dot product of the equation $\overrightarrow{OC} = m \overrightarrow{OA} + n \overrightarrow{OB}$ with $\overrightarrow{OA},$ we get
\[\overrightarrow{OA} \cdot \overrightarrow{OC} = m \overrightarrow{OA} \cdot \overrightarrow{OA} + n \overrightarrow{OA} \cdot \overrightarrow{OB}.\]Then $\|\overrightarrow{OA}\| \|\overrightarrow{OC}\| \cos \angle AOC = m \|\overrightarrow{OA}\|^2 + n \|\overrightarrow{OA}\| \|\overrightarrow{OB}\| \cos \angle AOB,$ or
\[\frac{1}{5} = m - \frac{3}{5} n.\]Taking the dot product of the equation $\overrightarrow{OC} = m \overrightarrow{OA} + n \overrightarrow{OB}$ with $\overrightarrow{OB},$ we get
\[\overrightarrow{OB} \cdot \overrightarrow{OC} = m \overrightarrow{OA} \cdot \overrightarrow{OB} + n \overrightarrow{OB} \cdot \overrightarrow{OB}.\]Then $\|\overrightarrow{OB}\| \|\overrightarrow{OC}\| \cos \angle BOC = m \|\overrightarrow{OA}\| \|\overrightarrow{OB}\| \cos \angle AOB + n \|\overrightarrow{OB}\|^2,$ or
\[1 = -\frac{3}{5} m + n.\]Solving the system $\frac{1}{5} = m - \frac{3}{5} n$ and $1 = -\frac{3}{5} m + n,$ we find $(m,n) = \boxed{\left( \frac{5}{4}, \frac{7}{4} \right)}.$
Each term is of the form $\frac{1}{\sin k^\circ \sin (k + 1)^\circ}.$  To deal with this term, we look at $\sin ((k + 1)^\circ - k^\circ).$  From the angle subtraction formula,
\[\sin ((k + 1)^\circ - k^\circ) = \sin (k + 1)^\circ \cos k^\circ - \cos (k + 1)^\circ \sin k^\circ.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin 1^\circ}{\sin k^\circ \sin (k + 1)^\circ} &= \frac{\sin ((k + 1)^\circ - k^\circ)}{\sin k^\circ \sin (k + 1)^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\sin (k + 1)^\circ \cos k^\circ - \cos (k + 1)^\circ \sin k^\circ}{\sin k^\circ \sin (k + 1)^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\cos k^\circ}{\sin k^\circ} - \frac{\cos (k + 1)^\circ}{\sin (k + 1)^\circ} \\
&= \cot k^\circ - \cot (k + 1)^\circ.
\end{align*}Hence,
\[\frac{1}{\sin k^\circ \sin (k + 1)^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin 1^\circ} (\cot k^\circ - \cot (k + 1)^\circ).\]Then
\begin{align*}
&\frac{1}{\sin 45^\circ \sin 46^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin 47^\circ \sin 48^\circ} + \dots + \frac{1}{\sin 133^\circ \sin 134^\circ} \\
&= \frac{1}{\sin 1^\circ} (\cot 45^\circ - \cot 46^\circ + \cot 47^\circ - \cot 48^\circ + \dots + \cot 133^\circ - \cot 134^\circ).
\end{align*}Since $\cot (180^\circ - x) = -\cot x,$ the sum reduces to
\[\frac{\cot 45^\circ - \cot 90^\circ}{\sin 1^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin 1^\circ}.\]Thus, the smallest such positive integer $n$ is $\boxed{1}.$
From the formula for a projection,
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{w}} (-2 \mathbf{v}) &= \frac{(-2 \mathbf{v}) \cdot \mathbf{w}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|^2} \mathbf{w} \\
&= -2 \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|^2} \mathbf{w} \\
&= -2 \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{w}} \mathbf{v} \\
&= \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}}.
\end{align*}

Then by the Law of Cosines applied to triangles $ABP,$ $BCP,$ $CAP,$ we get
\begin{align*}
y^2 &= x^2 + 169 - 26x \cos \omega, \\
z^2 &= y^2 + 196 - 28y \cos \omega, \\
x^2 &= z^2 + 225 - 30z \cos \omega.
\end{align*}Adding these, we get $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 590 - (26x + 28y + 30z) \cos \omega.$  Then
\[(26x + 28y + 30z) \cos \omega = 590,\]or $(13x + 14y + 15z) \cos \omega = 295.$
Also, $[ABP] + [BCP] + [CAP] = [ABC].$  By Heron's formula, $[ABC] = 84,$ so
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot 13 \cdot x \sin \omega + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 14 \cdot y \sin \omega + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 15 \cdot z \sin \omega = 84.\]Then $(13x + 14y + 15z) \sin \omega = 168.$
Dividing the equations $(13x + 14y + 15z) \sin \omega = 168$ and $(13x + 14y + 15z) \cos \omega = 295,$ we get $\tan \omega = \boxed{\frac{168}{295}}.$
From the triple angle formula,
\[\tan 3 \theta = \frac{3 \tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3 \tan^2 \theta} = \frac{3 \cdot 4 - 4^3}{1 - 3 \cdot 4^2} = \boxed{\frac{52}{47}}.\]
Let $f(\theta) = \cos \theta.$  When $\theta = 0,$ $r = 1,$ so in rectangular coordinates,
\[(x,y) = (1 \cos \theta, 1 \sin \theta) = (1,0).\]Furthermore, the function $f(\theta) = \cos \theta$ is periodic, so we must find the next angle for which $(x,y) = (1,0).$  This occurs if and only if either of the following conditions is met:
(1) $\theta$ is of the form $2 \pi k,$ where $k$ is an integer, and $r = 1,$ or
(2) $\theta$ is of the form $2 \pi k + \pi,$ where $k$ is an integer, and $r = -1.$
If $\theta = 2 \pi k,$ then
\[r = \cos \theta = \cos 2 \pi k = 1,\]so any angle of the form $\theta = 2 \pi k$ works.
If $\theta = 2 \pi k + \pi,$ then
\[r = \cos \theta = \cos (2 \pi k + \pi) = -1,\]so any of the form $\theta = 2 \pi k + \pi$ also works.
Also, if $r = f(\theta) = \cos \theta,$ then
\[f(\theta + \pi) = \cos (\theta + \pi) = -\cos \theta = -r.\]In polar coordinates, the points $(r, \theta)$ and $(-r, \theta + \pi)$ coincide, so the graph repeats after an interval of $\pi.$
Therefore, the smallest possible value of $t$ is $\boxed{\pi}.$

We can write
\begin{align*}
\tan 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ &= \frac{\sin 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} + 4 \sin 20^\circ \\
&= \frac{\sin 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.
\end{align*}By double angle formula,
\[\frac{\sin 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 20^\circ + 2 \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.\]Then by sum-to-product,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin 20^\circ + 2 \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} &= \frac{\sin 20^\circ + \sin 40^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin 30^\circ \cos 10^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\cos 10^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\cos 10^\circ + \cos 50^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.
\end{align*}Again by sum-to-product,
\[\frac{\cos 10^\circ + \cos 50^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = \frac{2 \cos 30^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = 2 \cos 30^\circ = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}.\]

Note that $\cos \angle AOB = -\frac{1}{11},$ so by the Law of Cosines on triangle $AOB,$
\[AB = \sqrt{1 + 1 - 2(1)(1) \left( -\frac{1}{11} \right)} = \sqrt{\frac{24}{11}} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{6}{11}}.\]Similarly, $AC = BC = BD = CD = 2 \sqrt{\frac{6}{11}}.$
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{BC}.$  Since triangle $ABC$ is equilateral with side length $2 \sqrt{\frac{6}{11}},$ $BM = CM = \sqrt{\frac{6}{11}}$, and $AM = \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{6}{11}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{11}}.$

Then by Pythagoras on right triangle $BMO,$
\[MO = \sqrt{BO^2 - BM^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{6}{11}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{11}}.\]By the Law of Cosines on triangle $AMO,$
\[\cos \angle AOM = \frac{AO^2 + MO^2 - AM^2}{2 \cdot AO \cdot MO} = \frac{1 + \frac{5}{11} - \frac{18}{11}}{2 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{5}{11}}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{55}}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{d} &= \cos \angle AOD \\
&= \cos (2 \angle AOM) \\
&= 2 \cos^2 \angle AOM - 1 \\
&= 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{55}} \right)^2 - 1 \\
&= \boxed{-\frac{53}{55}}.
\end{align*}
We can write
\[\cot \frac{x}{4} - \cot x = \frac{\cos \frac{x}{4}}{\sin \frac{x}{4}} - \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \frac{\cos \frac{x}{4} \sin x - \sin \frac{x}{4} \cos x}{\sin \frac{x}{4} \sin x}.\]From the angle subtraction formula,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\cos \frac{x}{4} \sin x - \sin \frac{x}{4} \cos x}{\sin \frac{x}{4} \sin x} &= \frac{\sin (x - \frac{x}{4})}{\sin \frac{x}{4} \sin x} \\
&= \frac{\sin \frac{3x}{4}}{\sin \frac{x}{4} \sin x},
\end{align*}so $k = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.$
The entries in each row are $\cos n,$ $\cos (n + 1),$ and $\cos (n + 2)$ for some integer $n.$  From the angle addition formula,
\[\cos n + \cos (n + 2) = 2 \cos (n + 1) \cos 1.\]Then
\[\cos (n + 2) = 2 \cos 1 \cos (n + 1) - \cos n.\]Thus, we can obtain the third column of the matrix by multiplying the second column by $2 \cos 1,$ and subtracting the first column
In other words, the third column is a linear combination of the first two columns
Therefore, the determinant is $\boxed{0}.$
The condition $\cos 3A + \cos 3B + \cos 3C = 1$ implies
\begin{align*}
0 &= 1 - \cos 3A - (\cos 3B + \cos 3C) \\
&= 2 \sin^2 \frac{3A}{2} - 2 \cos \frac{3B + 3C}{2}  \cos \frac{3B - 3C}{2} \\
&= 2 \sin^2 \frac{3A}{2} - 2 \cos \left( 270^\circ - \frac{3A}{2} \right) \cos \frac{3B - 3C}{2} \\
&= 2 \sin^2 \frac{3A}{2} + 2 \sin \frac{3A}{2} \cos \frac{3B - 3C}{2} \\
&= 2 \sin \frac{3A}{2} \left( \sin \frac{3A}{2} + \cos \frac{3B - 3C}{2} \right) \\
&= 2 \sin \frac{3A}{2} \left( \sin \left( 270^\circ - \frac{3B + 3C}{2} \right) + \cos \frac{3B - 3C}{2} \right) \\
&= 2 \sin \frac{3A}{2} \left( \cos \frac{3B - 3C}{2} - \cos \frac{3B + 3C}{2} \right) \\
&= 2 \sin \frac{3A}{2} \cdot \left( -2 \sin \frac{3B}{2} \sin \left( -\frac{3C}{2} \right) \right) \\
&= 4 \sin \frac{3A}{2} \sin \frac{3B}{2} \sin \frac{3C}{2}.
\end{align*}Therefore, one of $\frac{3A}{2},$ $\frac{3B}{2},$ $\frac{3C}{2}$ must be $180^\circ,$ which means one of $A,$ $B,$ $C$ must be $120^\circ.$  Then the maximum length is obtained when the $120^\circ$ is between the sides of length 10 and 13
By the Law of Cosines, this length is
\[\sqrt{10^2 + 10 \cdot 13 + 13^2} = \boxed{\sqrt{399}}.\]
Since the determinant is $(9)(-12) - (18)(-6) = 0,$ the inverse does not exist, so the answer is the zero matrix $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}}.$
From the triple angle formulas, $\cos 3 \theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta.$  Hence,
\[\cos^3 \theta = \frac{1}{4} \cos 3 \theta + \frac{3}{4} \cos \theta,\]so $(a,b) = \boxed{\left( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4} \right)}.$
Since $AB = 115$ and $AD = 38,$ $BD = 115 - 38 = 77.$

Let $\mathbf{a}$ denote $\overrightarrow{A},$ etc
Since $AD = 38$ and $BD = 77,$
\[\mathbf{d} = \frac{77}{115} \mathbf{a} + \frac{38}{115} \mathbf{b}.\]Since $AC = 115$ and $CF = 77,$
\[\mathbf{c} = \frac{77}{192} \mathbf{a} + \frac{115}{192} \mathbf{f}.\]Isolating $\mathbf{a}$ in each equation, we obtain
\[\mathbf{a} = \frac{115 \mathbf{d} - 38 \mathbf{b}}{77} = \frac{192 \mathbf{c} - 115 \mathbf{f}}{77}.\]Then $115 \mathbf{d} - 38 \mathbf{b} = 192 \mathbf{c} - 115 \mathbf{f},$ so $115 \mathbf{d} + 115 \mathbf{f} = 38 \mathbf{b} + 192 \mathbf{c},$ or
\[\frac{115}{230} \mathbf{d} + \frac{115}{230} \mathbf{f} = \frac{38}{230} \mathbf{b} + \frac{192}{230} \mathbf{c}.\]Since the coefficients on both sides of the equation add up to 1, the vector on the left side lies on line $DF,$ and the vector on the right side lies on line $BC.$  Therefore, this common vector is $\mathbf{e}.$
Furthermore, $\frac{EF}{DE} = \frac{115}{115} = 1$ and $\frac{CE}{BE} = \frac{192}{38} = \frac{96}{19},$ so
\begin{align*}
\frac{[CEF]}{[DBE]} &= \frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot EF \cdot CE \cdot \sin \angle CEF}{\frac{1}{2} \cdot DE \cdot BE \cdot \sin \angle BED} \\
&= \frac{EF}{DE} \cdot \frac{CE}{BE} \cdot \frac{\sin \angle CEF}{\sin \angle BED} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{19}{96}}.
\end{align*}
Let $\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix}.$  Then
\[\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} pa + qc & pb + qd \\ ra + sc & rb + sd \end{pmatrix}.\]We want this to be equal to $\begin{pmatrix} b & a \\ d & c \end{pmatrix}.$  There are no constants $p,$ $q,$ $r,$ $s$ that will make this work, so the answer is the zero matrix $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}}.$
The graph oscillates between 3 and $-1,$ so $d = \frac{3 + (-1)}{2} = \boxed{1}.$
We can write the expression as
\[\frac{\cos \frac{A - B}{2} \cos \frac{C}{2} - \sin \frac{A - B}{2} \sin \frac{C}{2}}{\sin \frac{C}{2} \cos \frac{C}{2}}.\]The numerator is
\[\cos \left (\frac{A - B}{2} + \frac{C}{2} \right) = \cos \frac{A - B + C}{2} = \cos \frac{(180^\circ - B) - B}{2} = \cos (90^\circ - B) = \sin B,\]and the denominator is $\frac{1}{2} \sin C,$ so by the Law of Sines, the expression is
\[\frac{2 \sin B}{\sin C} = \frac{2AC}{AB} = \frac{10}{6} = \boxed{\frac{5}{3}}.\]
In rectangular coordinates, $\left( 8, \frac{7 \pi}{6} \right)$ becomes
\[\left( 8 \cos \frac{7 \pi}{6}, 8 \sin \frac{7 \pi}{6} \right) = \boxed{(-4 \sqrt{3},-4)}.\]
We see that the side length of equilateral triangle $PQR$ is 5
Let $x = AQ.$
By the Law of Cosines on triangle $BCP,$
\[BC^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 - 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cos 60^\circ = 7.\]Then by the Law of Cosines on triangle $ACQ,$
\[AC^2 = x^2 + 2^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot 2 \cdot \cos 60^\circ = x^2 - 2x + 4.\]Also, $AB = 3$ and $AR = 5 - x,$ so by the Law of Cosines on triangle $ABR,$
\[AB^2 = 3^2 + (5 - x)^2 - 2 \cdot 3 \cdot (5 - x) \cdot 60^\circ = x^2 - 7x + 19.\]Finally, by Pythagoras on right triangle $ABC,$ $BC^2 + AC^2 = AB^2,$ so
\[7 + x^2 - 2x + 4 = x^2 - 7x + 19.\]Solving, we find $x = \boxed{\frac{8}{5}}.$
Since $\sin 0 = 0,$ $\arcsin 0 = \boxed{0}.$
From the given equation,
\[\frac{\sin 4x}{\cos 4x} = \frac{\cos x - \sin x}{\cos x + \sin x}.\]Then
\[\cos x \sin 4x + \sin x \sin 4x = \cos x \cos 4x - \sin x \cos 4x,\]or
\[\cos x \sin 4x + \sin x \cos 4x = \cos x \cos 4x - \sin x \sin 4x.\]Applying sum-to-product to both sides, we get
\[\sin 5x = \cos 5x,\]so $\tan 5x = 1.$  The smallest such positive angle $x$ is $\boxed{9^\circ}.$
The graph has period $\frac{2 \pi}{3}.$  The period of $y = a \tan bx$ is $\frac{\pi}{b},$ so $b = \frac{3}{2}.$
The graph is then of the form
\[y = a \tan \left( \frac{3x}{2} \right).\]Since the graph passes through $\left( \frac{\pi}{6}, 2 \right),$
\[2 = a \tan \frac{\pi}{4} = a.\]Therefore, $ab = 2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \boxed{3}.$
For the vectors $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ y \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ to be orthogonal, their dot product should be 0:
\[(1)(-2) + (-3)(y) + (-4)(-1) = 0.\]Solving, we find $y = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.$
From the given equation, $2c_1 - 2c_2 = -1$ and $3c_1 + 5c_2 = 4.$  Solving, we find
\[(c_1,c_2) = \boxed{\left( \frac{3}{16}, \frac{11}{16} \right)}.\]
The matrix corresponding to rotating about the origin counter-clockwise by an angle of $\theta$ is given by
\[\begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\ \sin \theta & \cos \theta \end{pmatrix}.\]The determinant of this matrix is then
\[\cos^2 \theta - (-\sin \theta)(\sin \theta) = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = \boxed{1}.\](Why does this make sense geometrically?)
Since $\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 1,$ there exists an angle $\theta$ such that $\cos \theta = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}$ and $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.$  Then by the angle addition formula,
\begin{align*}
\cos x + 2 \sin x &= \sqrt{5} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \cos x + \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \sin x \right) \\
&= \sqrt{5} (\sin \theta \cos x + \cos \theta \sin x) \\
&= \sqrt{5} \sin (x + \theta).
\end{align*}The maximum value of $\sqrt{5} \sin (x + \theta)$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{5}}.$
Let $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $60^\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.

Triangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \frac{1}{2}$ and $DP = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$, so $\tan 60^\circ =\frac{\sin 60^\circ}{\cos 60^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{1/2} = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}$.
The vector pointing from $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ to $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is $\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.$  Scaling, we can take $\mathbf{n} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector of plane $P.$  Thus, the equation of plane $P$ is
\[x - y + 2z = 0.\](We know that the constant is 0, because the plane passes through the origin.)
Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix},$ and let $\mathbf{p}$ be its projection onto plane $P.$  Note that $\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{p}$ is parallel to $\mathbf{n}.$

Thus, $\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{p}$ is the projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\mathbf{n}.$  Hence,
\[\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{p} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{18}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.\]Then
\[\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{v} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We write $-64 = 2^6 \operatorname{cis} 180^\circ,$ so $x^6 = 2^6 \operatorname{cis} 180^\circ.$  The solutions are of the form
\[x = 2 \operatorname{cis} (30^\circ + 60^\circ k),\]where $0 \le k \le 5.$

The solutions where the real part is positive are then $2 \operatorname{cis} 30^\circ$ and $2 \operatorname{cis} 330^\circ,$ and their product is $2 \operatorname{cis} 30^\circ \cdot 2 \operatorname{cis} 330^\circ = 4 \operatorname{cis} 360^\circ = \boxed{4}.$
Place the rectangle in the complex plane so that one corner is at the origin, and the sides align with the real and imaginary axis
To maximize the area of the triangle, we let one vertex of the triangle be at the origin, and we let the other two vertices ($p$ and $q$) lie on the sides of the rectangle, as shown.
unitsize(0.4 cm);
pair A, B, C, D, P, Q;
A = (0,0);
B = (11,0);
C = (11,10);
D = (0,10);

P = rotate(-60)*(Q);

Then $p = 11 + yi$ for some real number $y.$  Also,
\begin{align*}
q &= e^{\pi i/3} p \\
&= \left( \frac{1}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) (11 + yi) \\
&= \left( \frac{11}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} y \right) + i \left( \frac{y}{2} + \frac{11 \sqrt{3}}{2} \right).
\end{align*}Since the imaginary part of $q$ is 10,
\[\frac{y}{2} + \frac{11 \sqrt{3}}{2} = 10,\]so $y = 20 - 11 \sqrt{3}.$
Then the area of the triangle is
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \left|11 + (20 - 11 \sqrt{3}) i\right|^2 &= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \left(11^2 + (20 - 11 \sqrt{3})^2\right) \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (884 - 440 \sqrt{3}) \\
&= \boxed{221 \sqrt{3} - 330}.
\end{align*}
From the equation $r = -2 \cos \theta + 6 \sin \theta,$
\[r^2 = -2r \cos \theta + 6r \sin \theta.\]Then $x^2 + y^2 = -2x + 6y.$  Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get
\[(x + 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 10.\]Thus, the graph is the circle centered at $(-1,3)$ with radius $\sqrt{10}.$  Its area is $\boxed{10 \pi}.$

Let $x = \frac{\pi y}{2}.$  Then the given equation becomes
\[2 \cos (\pi y) \left( \cos (\pi y) - \cos \left( \frac{4028 \pi}{y} \right) \right) = \cos (2 \pi y) - 1.\]By the double-angle formula,
\[2 \cos (\pi y) \left( \cos (\pi y) - \cos \left( \frac{4028 \pi}{y} \right) \right) = -2 \sin^2 (\pi y).\]Dividing by 2 and expanding
\[\cos^2 (\pi y) - \cos (\pi y) \cos \left( \frac{4028 \pi}{y} \right) = -\sin^2 (\pi y).\]Hence,
\[\cos (\pi y) \cos \left( \frac{4028 \pi}{y} \right) = \cos^2 (\pi y) + \sin^2 (\pi y) = 1.\]For this equation to hold, we must have $\cos (\pi y) = \cos \left( \frac{4028 \pi}{y} \right) = 1$ or $\cos (\pi y) = \cos \left( \frac{4028 \pi}{y} \right) = -1.$  In turn, these conditions hold only when $y$ and $\frac{4028}{y}$ are integers with the same parity.
The prime factorization of 4028 is $2^2 \cdot 19 \cdot 53.$  Clearly both $y$ and $\frac{4028}{y}$ cannot be odd, so both are even, which means both get exactly one factor of 2
Then the either $y$ or $\frac{4028}{y}$ can get the factor of 19, and either can get the factor of 53
Therefore, the possible values of $y$ are 2, $2 \cdot 19,$ 5$2 \cdot 53,$ and $2 \cdot 19 \cdot 53.$  Then the sum of the possible values of $x$ is
\[\pi (1 + 19 + 53 + 19 \cdot 53) = \boxed{1080 \pi}.\]
We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} 0 & \sin \alpha & -\cos \alpha \\ -\sin \alpha & 0 & \sin \beta \\ \cos \alpha & -\sin \beta & 0 \end{vmatrix} &= -\sin \alpha \begin{vmatrix} -\sin \alpha & \sin \beta \\ \cos \alpha & 0 \end{vmatrix} - \cos \alpha \begin{vmatrix} -\sin \alpha & 0 \\ \cos \alpha & -\sin \beta \end{vmatrix} \\
&= -\sin \alpha (-\sin \beta \cos \alpha) - \cos \alpha (\sin \alpha \sin \beta) \\
&= \boxed{0}.
\end{align*}
We compute the first few powers of $\mathbf{A}$:
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^2 &= \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \\
\mathbf{A}^3 &= \mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{I}.
\end{align*}Then
\[\mathbf{A}^{100} = (\mathbf{A}^3)^{33} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
\[\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -10 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = -\frac{2}{3} \begin{pmatrix} 15 \\ -9 \end{pmatrix} = -\frac{2}{3} \bold{w}\]is a scalar multiple of $\bold{w}$,
\[\text{proj}_{\bold{w}} \bold{v} = \bold{v} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -10 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We see that
\[\bold{A}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 & 5 \end{pmatrix}\]and
\[\bold{A}^3 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 & 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 & 12 \\ 6 & 4 & 6 \\ 12 & 6 & 4 \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, we want $p$, $q$, and $r$ to satisfy
\[\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 & 12 \\ 6 & 4 & 6 \\ 12 & 6 & 4 \end{pmatrix} + p \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 & 5 \end{pmatrix} + q \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + r \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.\]The left-hand side is equal to
\[\begin{pmatrix} 5p + r + 4 & 2p + q + 6 & p + 2q + 12 \\ 2p + q + 6 & 2p + r + 4 & 2p + q + 6 \\ p + 2q + 12 & 2p + q + 6 & 5p + r + 4 \end{pmatrix}.\]This gives us the system of equations
\begin{align*}
5p + r &= -4, \\
2p + q &= -6, \\
p + 2q &= -12, \\
2p + r &= -4.
\end{align*}Solving this system, we find $(p,q,r) = \boxed{(0,-6,-4)}.$
Note: The polynomial $x^3+px^2+qx+r$ is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix $\mathbf A.$
By sum-to-product,
\begin{align*}
\sin 10^\circ + \sin 80^\circ &= 2 \sin 45^\circ \cos 35^\circ, \\
\sin 20^\circ + \sin 70^\circ &= 2 \sin 45^\circ \cos 25^\circ, \\
\sin 30^\circ + \sin 60^\circ &= 2 \sin 45^\circ \cos 15^\circ, \\
\sin 40^\circ + \sin 50^\circ &= 2 \sin 45^\circ \cos 5^\circ,
\end{align*}so the given expression becomes
\[\frac{2 \sin 45^\circ (\cos 35^\circ + \cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ + \cos 5^\circ)}{\cos 5^\circ \cos 10^\circ \cos 20^\circ}.\]Similarly,
\begin{align*}
\cos 35^\circ + \cos 5^\circ &= 2 \cos 20^\circ \cos 15^\circ, \\
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ &= 2 \cos 20^\circ \cos 5^\circ,
\end{align*}so the expression becomes
\[\frac{4 \sin 45^\circ \cos 20^\circ (\cos 5^\circ + \cos 15^\circ)}{\cos 5^\circ \cos 10^\circ \cos 20^\circ} = \frac{4 \sin 45^\circ (\cos 5^\circ + \cos 15^\circ)}{\cos 5^\circ \cos 10^\circ}.\]Finally, $\cos 5^\circ + \cos 15^\circ = 2 \cos 10^\circ \cos 5^\circ,$ so
\[\frac{4 \sin 45^\circ (\cos 5^\circ + \cos 15^\circ)}{\cos 5^\circ \cos 10^\circ} = 8 \sin 45^\circ = \boxed{4 \sqrt{2}}.\]
Since $\mathbf{a}$ is parallel to $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},$
\[\mathbf{a} = t \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} t \\ t \\ t \end{pmatrix}\]for some scalar $t.$  Then
\[\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -3 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} t \\ t \\ t \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - t \\ -3 - t \\ -6 - t \end{pmatrix}.\]We want this to be orthogonal to $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},$ so
\[\begin{pmatrix} 6 - t \\ -3 - t \\ -6 - t \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = 0.\]Then $(6 - t)(1) + (-3 - t)(1) + (-6 - t)(1) = 0.$  Solving, we find $t = -1.$  Then $\mathbf{b} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ -2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}}.$
Let $A = (\alpha,0,0),$ $B = (0,\beta,0),$ and $C = (0,0,\gamma).$  Then the equation of plane $ABC$ is given by
\[\frac{x}{\alpha} + \frac{y}{\beta} + \frac{z}{\gamma} = 1.\]Since the distance between the origin and plane is 1,
\[\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{\alpha^2} + \frac{1}{\beta^2} + \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}} = 1.\]Then
\[\frac{1}{\alpha^2} + \frac{1}{\beta^2} + \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 1.\]The centroid of triangle $ABC$ is
\[(p,q,r) = \left( \frac{\alpha}{3}, \frac{\beta}{3}, \frac{\gamma}{3} \right).\]Then $p = \frac{\alpha}{3},$ $q = \frac{\beta}{3},$ and $r = \frac{\gamma}{3},$ so
\[\frac{1}{p^2} + \frac{1}{q^2} + \frac{1}{r^2} = \frac{9}{\alpha^2} + \frac{9}{\beta^2} + \frac{9}{\gamma^2} = \boxed{9}.\]
We have that $\rho = 12,$ $\theta = \frac{7 \pi}{6},$ and $\phi = \frac{\pi}{3},$ so
\begin{align*}
x &= \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta = 12 \sin \frac{\pi}{3} \cos \frac{7 \pi}{6} = -9, \\
y &= \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta = 12 \sin \frac{\pi}{3} \sin \frac{7 \pi}{6} = -3 \sqrt{3}, \\
z &= \rho \cos \phi = 12 \cos \frac{\pi}{3} = 12 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 6.
\end{align*}Therefore, the rectangular coordinates are $\boxed{(-9, -3 \sqrt{3}, 6)}.$
The graph oscillates between 3 and $-1,$ so $a = \frac{3 - (-1)}{2} = \boxed{2}.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= \sin^4 x + 1 - \sin^2 x \\
&= \left( \sin^2 x - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{3}{4}.
\end{align*}Since $\sin^2 x$ varies between 0 and 1, the range of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{\left[ \frac{3}{4}, 1 \right]}.$
Suppose $\frac{\pi}{2} \le x \le \frac{3 \pi}{2}.$  Then
\[\sin x = \cos \left( x - \frac{\pi}{2} \right),\]and $0 \le x - \frac{\pi}{2} \le \pi,$ so
\[\arccos(\sin x) = x - \frac{\pi}{2}.\]Now, suppose $\frac{3 \pi}{2} \le x \le \frac{5 \pi}{2}.$  Then
\[\sin x = \cos \left( \frac{5 \pi}{2} - x \right),\]and $0 \le \frac{5 \pi}{2} - x \le \pi,$ so
\[\arccos(\sin x) = \frac{5 \pi}{2} - x.\]Thus, the graph of $y = \arccos(\sin x)$ for $\frac{\pi}{2} \le x \le \frac{5 \pi}{2}$ consists of two line segments, going from $\left( \frac{\pi}{2}, 0 \right)$ to $\left( \frac{3 \pi}{2}, \pi \right),$ then to $\left( \frac{5 \pi}{2}, 0 \right).$

Thus, the region we are interested in is a triangle with base $2 \pi$ and height $\pi,$ so its area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \pi \cdot \pi = \boxed{\pi^2}.$
The intercepts occur where $\sin \frac{1}{x}= 0$, that is, where $x = \frac{1}{k\pi}$ and $k$ is a nonzero integer
Solving
\[0.0001 < \frac{1}{k\pi} < 0.001\]yields
\[\frac{1000}{\pi} < k < \frac{10{,}000}{\pi}.\]Thus the number of $x$ intercepts in $(0.0001, 0.001)$ is
\[\left\lfloor\frac{10{,}000}{\pi}\right\rfloor -\left\lfloor\frac{1000}{\pi}\right\rfloor = 3183 - 318 = \boxed{2865}.\]
Note that
\begin{align*}
(\sec x + \tan x)(\sec x - \tan x) &= \sec^2 x - \tan^2 x \\
&= \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x} \\
&= \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos^2 x} = 1.
\end{align*}Therefore, $\sec x - \tan x = \boxed{\frac{2}{5}}.$
Let $\mathbf{a}$ denote $\overrightarrow{A},$ etc
Then from the given information,
\[\mathbf{d} = \frac{3}{4} \mathbf{a} + \frac{1}{4} \mathbf{b}\]and
\[\mathbf{e} = \frac{2}{3} \mathbf{a} + \frac{1}{3} \mathbf{c}.\]Hence, $\mathbf{b} = 4 \mathbf{d} - 3 \mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{c} = 3 \mathbf{e} - 2 \mathbf{a}.$
By the Angle Bisector Theorem, $\frac{BT}{TC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3},$ so
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{t} &= \frac{3}{5} \mathbf{b} + \frac{2}{5} \mathbf{c} \\
&= \frac{3}{5} (4 \mathbf{d} - 3 \mathbf{a}) + \frac{2}{5} (3 \mathbf{e} - 2 \mathbf{a}) \\
&= \frac{12}{5} \mathbf{d} + \frac{6}{5} \mathbf{e} - \frac{13}{5} \mathbf{a}.
\end{align*}Then $\mathbf{t} + \frac{13}{5} \mathbf{a} = \frac{12}{5} \mathbf{d} + \frac{6}{5} \mathbf{e},$ or
\[\frac{5}{18} \mathbf{t} + \frac{13}{18} \mathbf{a} = \frac{12}{18} \mathbf{d} + \frac{6}{18} \mathbf{e}.\]Since the coefficients on both sides of the equation add up to 1, the vector on the left side lies on line $AT,$ and the vector on the right side lies on line $DE.$  Therefore, this common vector is $\mathbf{f}.$  Furthermore, $\frac{AF}{AT} = \boxed{\frac{5}{18}}.$
The equation
\[\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 5 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} t = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 7t \\ -3 + 5t \\ -3 - t \end{pmatrix}\]describes a line, so if $\bold{v}$ is the vector that is closest to $\bold{a}$, then the vector joining $\bold{v}$ and $\bold{a}$ is orthogonal to the direction vector of the line.

This gives us the equation

\[\begin{pmatrix} -2 + 7t \\ -7 + 5t \\ -8 - t \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 5 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = 0,\]so $(-2 + 7t) \cdot 7 + (-7 + 5t) \cdot 5 + (-8 - t) \cdot (-1) = 0$
Solving for $t$, we find $t = \boxed{\frac{41}{75}}.$
In general, By DeMoivre's Theorem,
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{cis} n \theta &= (\operatorname{cis} \theta)^n \\
&= (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)^n \\
&= \cos^n \theta + \binom{n}{1} i \cos^{n - 1} \theta \sin \theta - \binom{n}{2} \cos^{n - 2} \theta \sin^2 \theta - \binom{n}{3} i \cos^{n - 3} \theta \sin^3 \theta + \dotsb.
\end{align*}Matching real and imaginary parts, we get
\begin{align*}
\cos n \theta &= \cos^n \theta - \binom{n}{2} \cos^{n - 2} \theta \sin^2 \theta + \binom{n}{4} \cos^{n - 4} \theta \sin^4 \theta - \dotsb, \\
\sin n \theta &= \binom{n}{1} \cos^{n - 1} \theta \sin \theta - \binom{n}{3} \cos^{n - 3} \theta \sin^3 \theta + \binom{n}{5} \cos^{n - 5} \theta \sin^5 \theta - \dotsb.
\end{align*}Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\tan n \theta &= \frac{\sin n \theta}{\cos n \theta} \\
&= \frac{\dbinom{n}{1} \cos^{n - 1} \theta \sin \theta - \dbinom{n}{3} \cos^{n - 3} \theta \sin^3 \theta + \dbinom{n}{5} \cos^{n - 5} \theta \sin^5 \theta - \dotsb}{\cos^n \theta - \dbinom{n}{2} \cos^{n - 2} \theta \sin^2 \theta + \dbinom{n}{4} \cos^{n - 4} \theta \sin^4 \theta - \dotsb} \\
&= \frac{\dbinom{n}{1} \tan \theta - \dbinom{n}{3} \tan^3 \theta + \dbinom{n}{5} \tan^5 \theta - \dotsb}{1 - \dbinom{n}{2} \tan^2 \theta + \dbinom{n}{4} \tan^4 \theta - \dotsb}.
\end{align*}Taking $n = 7,$ we get
\[\tan 7 \theta = \frac{7 \tan \theta - 35 \tan^3 \theta + 21 \tan^5 \theta - \tan^7 \theta}{1 - 21 \tan^2 \theta + 35 \tan^4 \theta - 7 \tan^6 \theta}.\]Note that for $\theta = \frac{\pi}{7},$ $\frac{2 \pi}{7},$ and $\frac{3 \pi}{7},$ $\tan 7 \theta = 0.$  Thus, $\tan \frac{\pi}{7},$ $\tan \frac{2 \pi}{7},$ and $\tan \frac{3 \pi}{7}$ are the roots of
\[7t - 35t^3 + 21t^5 - t^7 = 0,\]or $t^7 - 21t^5 + 35t^3 - 7t = 0.$  We can take out a factor of $t,$ to get
\[t (t^6 - 21t^4 + 35t^2 - 7) = 0.\]We know that three of the roots are $\tan \frac{\pi}{7},$ $\tan \frac{2 \pi}{7},$ and $\tan \frac{3 \pi}{7}.$  Since the exponents in $t^6 - 21t^4 + 35t^2 - 7$ are all even, the other three roots are $-\tan \frac{\pi}{7},$ $-\tan \frac{2 \pi}{7},$ and $-\tan \frac{3 \pi}{7}.$  Then by Vieta's formulas,
\[\left( \tan \frac{\pi}{7} \right) \left( \tan \frac{2 \pi}{7} \right) \left( \tan \frac{3 \pi}{7} \right) \left( -\tan \frac{\pi}{7} \right) \left( -\tan \frac{2 \pi}{7} \right) \left( -\tan \frac{3 \pi}{7} \right) = -7,\]so
\[\tan^2 \frac{\pi}{7} \tan^2 \frac{2 \pi}{7} \tan^2 \frac{3 \pi}{7} = 7.\]Since all the angles are acute, each tangent is positive
Hence,
\[\tan \frac{\pi}{7} \tan \frac{2 \pi}{7} \tan \frac{3 \pi}{7} = \boxed{\sqrt{7}}.\]
We see that
\[3 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -8 \end{pmatrix} - 2 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -24 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -14 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -10 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
From $r = \frac{1}{\sin \theta - \cos \theta},$
\[r \sin \theta - r \cos \theta = 1.\]Then $y - x = 1,$ which is the equation of a line
The answer is $\boxed{\text{(A)}}.$

We can write the matrix product as
\[\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{r}_1 \\ \mathbf{r}_2 \\ \mathbf{r}_3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} | & | & | \\ a \mathbf{v} & b \mathbf{v} & c \mathbf{v} \\ | & | & | \end{pmatrix},\]where $\mathbf{r}_1 = (0,c,-b),$ $\mathbf{r}_2 = (-c,0,a),$ $\mathbf{r}_3 = (b,-a,0),$ and $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix}.$
We can confirm that $\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$ for all $i,$ $1 \le i \le 3,$ so the product of the two matrices is simply the zero matrix, or
\[\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Let $\theta = \arcsin x,$ so $0 < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\sin \theta = x.$  Then
\[\cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - x^2},\]so
\[\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.\]Thus,
\[\sin (\arccos (\tan (\arcsin x) ) ) ) = \sin \left( \arccos \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right).\]Let $\psi = \arccos \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}},$ so $0 < \psi < \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\cos \psi = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.$  Then
\[\sin \psi = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \psi} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{1 - x^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 2x^2}{1 - x^2}} = x.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[\frac{1 - 2x^2}{1 - x^2} = x^2.\]Then $1 - 2x^2 = x^2 - x^4,$ so $x^4 - 3x^2 + 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,
\[x^2 = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]The positive solutions are then $\sqrt{\frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}$ and $\sqrt{\frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}}.$  However, $\arcsin x$ is defined only for $-1 \le x \le 1,$ so there is only $\boxed{1}$ positive solution, namely
\[x = \sqrt{\frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}}.\]
Let $\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}.$  Then
\[\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a + 2b \\ c + 2d \end{pmatrix}.\]Also,
\[\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -3a + b \\ -3c + d \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, we have the system of equations
\begin{align*}
a + 2b &= -4, \\
c + 2d &= 4, \\
-3a + b &= -23, \\
-3c + d &= 2.
\end{align*}Solving this system, we find $a = 6,$ $b = -5,$ $c = 0,$ and $d = 2,$ so
\[\mathbf{M} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 6 & -5 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
From the formula for a projection,
\[\operatorname{proj}_{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\|^2} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{8}{4} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
The dot product of $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -4 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is
\[(3)(-5) + (-4)(2) + (-3)(1) = \boxed{-26}.\]
Since the tangent function has period $180^\circ,$
\[\tan (312^\circ - 2 \cdot 180^\circ) = \tan (-48^\circ),\]so $n = \boxed{-48}.$
Since $\sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ $\arcsin \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{4}}.$
Taking $t = 0,$ we find $\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ s \end{pmatrix}$ lies on the line
\[s = \frac{1}{2} (-7) + 4 = \frac{1}{2}.\]Taking $t = 1,$ we get
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 1/2 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} l \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -7 + l \\ -9/2 \end{pmatrix}.\]Then
\[-\frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2} (-7 + l) + 4.\]Solving for $l,$ we find $l = -10.$
Hence, $(r,k) = \boxed{\left( \frac{1}{2}, -10 \right)}.$
For the first line,
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + 2t \\ 1 - 3t \end{pmatrix}.\]For the second line,
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -9 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 + 4u \\ -9 + 2u \end{pmatrix}.\]Hence, $1 + 2t = 5 + 4u$ and $1 - 3t = -9 + 2u.$  Solving, we find $t = 3$ and $u = \frac{1}{2},$ so
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ -8 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Expanding the dot product, we get
\begin{align*}
(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) &= (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{a} - (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{b} \\
&= \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} \\
&= \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} \\
&= \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 \\
&= 3^2 - 6^2 = \boxed{-27}.
\end{align*}
Suppose $a_n = \sin^2 x.$  Then
\begin{align*}
a_{n + 1} &= 4a_n (1 - a_n) \\
&= 4 \sin^2 x (1 - \sin^2 x) \\
&= 4 \sin^2 x \cos^2 x \\
&= (2 \sin x \cos x)^2 \\
&= \sin^2 2x.
\end{align*}It follows that
\[a_n = \sin^2 \left( \frac{2^n \pi}{45} \right)\]for all $n \ge 0.$
We want to find the smallest $n$ so that $a_n = a_0.$  In other words
\[\sin^2 \left( \frac{2^n \pi}{45} \right) = \sin^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{45} \right).\]This means the angles $\frac{2^n \pi}{45}$ and $\frac{\pi}{45}$ either add up to a multiple of $\pi,$ or differ by a multiple of $\pi.$  In other words,
\[2^n \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{45}.\]We list the first few powers of 2 mod 45.
\begin{array}{c|c}
n & 2^n \pmod{45} \\ \hline
0 & 1 \\
1 & 2 \\
2 & 4 \\
3 & 8 \\
4 & 16 \\
5 & 32 \\
6 & 19 \\
7 & 38 \\
8 & 31 \\
9 & 17 \\
10 & 34 \\
11 & 23 \\
12 & 1
\end{array}
\]Thus, the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{12}.$
Since the graph of $y = 3 \sin \left( x - \frac{\pi}{5} \right)$ is the same as the graph of $y = 3 \sin x$ shifted $\frac{\pi}{5}$ units to the right, the phase shift is $\boxed{\frac{\pi}{5}}.$

Since $\mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{b}$ and $5 \mathbf{a} - 4 \mathbf{b}$ are orthogonal,
\[(\mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{b}) \cdot (5 \mathbf{a} - 4 \mathbf{b}) = 0.\]Expanding, we get
\[5 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 6 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} - 8 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0.\]Note that $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 = 1,$ and $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 = 1,$ so
\[6 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} - 3 = 0.\]Then $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \frac{1}{2}.$
If $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b},$ then
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{1/2}{1 \cdot 1} = \frac{1}{2}.\]Therefore, $\theta = \boxed{60^\circ}.$
We have that
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -5 & -7 \\ 4 & -9 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -7 \\ 5 & -7 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
First, we claim that $\arccos x + \arcsin x = \frac{\pi}{2}$ for all $x \in [-1,1].$
Note that
\[\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin x \right) = \cos (\arccos x) = x.\]Furthermore, $-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \arcsin x \le \frac{\pi}{2},$ so $0 \le \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin x \le \pi.$  Therefore,
\[\frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin x = \arccos x,\]so $\arccos x + \arcsin x = \frac{\pi}{2}.$
Let $\alpha = \arccos x$ and $\beta = \arcsin x,$ so $\alpha + \beta = \frac{\pi}{2}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= (\arccos x)^3 + (\arcsin x)^3 \\
&= \alpha^3 + \beta^3 \\
&= (\alpha + \beta)(\alpha^2 - \alpha \beta + \beta^2) \\
&= \frac{\pi}{2} \left( \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \beta \right)^2 - \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \beta \right) \beta + \beta^2 \right) \\
&= \frac{\pi}{2} \left( 3 \beta^2 - \frac{3 \pi \beta}{2} + \frac{\pi^2}{4} \right) \\
&= \frac{3 \pi}{2} \left( \beta^2 - \frac{\pi}{2} \beta + \frac{\pi^2}{12} \right) \\
&= \frac{3 \pi}{2} \left( \left( \beta - \frac{\pi}{4} \right)^2 + \frac{\pi^2}{48} \right).
\end{align*}Since $-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \beta \le \frac{\pi}{2},$ the range of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{\left[ \frac{\pi^3}{32}, \frac{7 \pi^3}{8} \right]}.$
From the equation $\cos^2 A + \cos^2 B + 2 \sin A \sin B \cos C = \frac{15}{8},$
\[\sin^2 A + \sin^2 B - 2 \sin A \sin B \cos C = \frac{1}{8}.\]By the Extended Law of Sines, $\sin A = \frac{a}{2R}$ and $\sin B = \frac{b}{2R},$ so
\[a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C = \frac{R^2}{2}.\]By the Law of Cosines, this is $c^2 = \frac{R^2}{2}.$  But $c = 2R \sin C,$ so
\[\sin^2 C = \frac{1}{8}.\]Since $B$ is obtuse, $C$ is acute, and $\sin C = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}.$  We can compute that $\cos C = \frac{\sqrt{14}}{4}.$
The same calculations on the second equation yield $\sin A = \frac{2}{3}$ and $\cos A = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
\cos B &= \cos (180^\circ - A - C) \\
&= -\cos (A + C) \\
&= -\cos A \cos C + \sin A \sin C \\
&= -\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{14}}{4} + \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} \\
&= \frac{2 \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{70}}{12},
\end{align*}so
\begin{align*}
\cos^2 C + \cos^2 A + 2 \sin C \sin A \cos B &= \frac{14}{16} + \frac{5}{9} + 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2 \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{70}}{12} \\
&= \frac{111 - 4 \sqrt{35}}{72}.
\end{align*}The final answer is $111 + 4 + 35 + 72 = \boxed{222}.$
Let $\mathbf{a}$ denote $\overrightarrow{A},$ etc
Then from the given information,
\[\mathbf{p} = \frac{3}{7} \mathbf{a} + \frac{4}{7} \mathbf{d} = \frac{2}{3} \mathbf{f} + \frac{1}{3} \mathbf{c}.\]Then $9 \mathbf{a} + 12 \mathbf{d} = 14 \mathbf{f} + 7 \mathbf{c},$ so $12 \mathbf{d} - 7 \mathbf{c} = 14 \mathbf{f} - 9 \mathbf{a},$ or
\[\frac{12}{5} \mathbf{d} - \frac{7}{5} \mathbf{c} = \frac{14}{5} \mathbf{f} - \frac{9}{5} \mathbf{a}.\]Since the coefficients on both sides of the equation add up to 1, the vector on the left side lies on line $CD,$ and the vector on the right side lies on line $AF.$  Therefore, this common vector is $\mathbf{b}.$  Then
\[\mathbf{b} = \frac{14}{5} \mathbf{f} - \frac{9}{5} \mathbf{a}.\]Isolating $\mathbf{f},$ we find
\[\mathbf{f} = \frac{9}{14} \mathbf{a} + \frac{5}{14} \mathbf{b}.\]Therefore, $\frac{AF}{FB} = \boxed{\frac{5}{9}}.$
By symmetry, $AC = CE.$  Let $x = AC = CE.$

By the Law of Cosines on triangle $ABC,$
\[x^2 = 4^2 + 4^2 - 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cos B = 32 - 32 \cos B = 32 (1 - \cos \angle B).\]By the Law of Cosines on triangle $ACE,$
\[1^2 = x^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot x \cos \angle ACE = 2x^2 (1 - \cos \angle ACE).\]Hence, $64 (1 - \cos \angle B)(1 - \cos \angle ACE) = 1,$ so
\[(1 - \cos \angle B)(1 - \cos \angle ACE) = \boxed{\frac{1}{64}}.\]
\[P(x) = \prod_{k = 1}^{12} (x - e^{2 \pi ki/13}).\]The roots of this polynomial are $e^{2 \pi ki/13}$ for $1 \le k \le 12.$  They are also roots of $x^{13} - 1 = (x - 1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + x^{10} + \dots + x^2 + x + 1).$  Thus,
\[P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + x^{10} + \dots + x^2 + x + 1.\]Now, $e^{2 \pi ji/11},$ for $1 \le j \le 10,$ is a root of $x^{11} - 1 = (x - 1)(x^{10} + x^9 + x^8 + \dots + x^2 + x + 1),$ so $e^{2 \pi ji/11}$ is a root
\[x^{10} + x^9 + x^8 + \dots + x^2 + x + 1.\]So, if $x = e^{2 \pi ji/11},$ then
\begin{align*}
P(x) &= x^{12} + x^{11} + x^{10} + \dots + x^2 + x + 1 \\
&= x^2 (x^{10} + x^9 + x^8 + \dots + x^2 + x + 1) + x + 1 \\
&= x + 1.
\end{align*}Hence,
\begin{align*}
\prod_{k = 1}^{12} \prod_{j = 1}^{10} (e^{2 \pi ji/11} - e^{2 \pi ki/13}) &= \prod_{j = 1}^{10} P(e^{2 \pi ji/11}) \\
&= \prod_{j = 1}^{10} (e^{2 \pi ji/11} + 1).
\end{align*}By similar reasoning,
\[Q(x) = \prod_{j = 1}^{10} (x - e^{2 \pi ji/11}) = x^{10} + x^9 + x^8 + \dots + x^2 + x + 1,\]so
\begin{align*}
\prod_{j = 1}^{10} (e^{2 \pi ji/11} + 1) &= \prod_{j = 1}^{10} (-1 - e^{2 \pi ji/11}) \\
&= Q(-1) \\
&= \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
We have that
\[\sec 135^\circ = \frac{1}{\cos 135^\circ}.\]Then $\cos 135^\circ = -\cos (135^\circ - 180^\circ) = -\cos (-45^\circ) = -\cos 45^\circ = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ so
\[\frac{1}{\cos 135^\circ} = \boxed{-\sqrt{2}}.\]
First, we can write
\[\frac{1}{\cos 80^\circ} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sin 80^\circ} = \frac{\sin 80^\circ - \sqrt{3} \cos 80^\circ}{\cos 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ}.\]From the angle subtraction formula, we can write the numerator as
\begin{align*}
\sin 80^\circ - \sqrt{3} \cos 80^\circ &= 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} \sin 80^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos 80^\circ \right) \\
&= 2 (\cos 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ - \sin 60^\circ \cos 80^\circ) \\
&= 2 \sin (80^\circ - 60^\circ) \\
&= 2 \sin 20^\circ.
\end{align*}Also, from the angle addition formula, $\sin 160^\circ = \sin (80^\circ + 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ \cos 80^\circ + \cos 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ = 2 \cos 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ,$ so
\[\cos 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \sin 160^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \sin 20^\circ.\]Therefore,
\[\frac{\sin 80^\circ - \sqrt{3} \cos 80^\circ}{\cos 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ} = \frac{2 \sin 20^\circ}{\frac{1}{2} \sin 20^\circ} = \boxed{4}.\]
We have that $e^{11 \pi i/2} = \cos \frac{11 \pi}{2} + i \sin \frac{11 \pi}{2} = \boxed{-i}$.
If $0 < x < \frac{\pi}{2},$ then $\sin x,$ $\cos x,$ and $\tan x$ are all positive, so $f(x) > 0.$
For $x = \frac{\pi}{2},$ $\tan x$ is not defined.
If $\frac{\pi}{2} < x < \pi,$ then $\sin x$ is positive, and $\cos x$ and $\tan x$ are negative
Suppose $f(x) = 0.$  Then
\[\sin x + 2 \cos x = -3 \tan x > 0.\]Hence,
\[\sin x + \cos x > \sin x + 2 \cos x > 0.\]Then $\tan x \cos x + \cos x = \cos x (\tan x + 1) > 0,$ so $\tan x + 1 < 0,$ which means $\tan x < -1.$  But then
\[f(x) = \sin x + 2 \cos x + 3 \tan x < 1 + 2(0) + 3(-1) = -2,\]so there are no solutions to $f(x) = 0$ in this case.
Note that $f(\pi) = -2$ and $f \left( \frac{5 \pi}{4} \right) = 3 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} > 0.$  Therefore, by continuity, $f(x) = 0$ has a root between $\pi$ and $\frac{5 \pi}{4}.$  Since $3 < \pi < \frac{5 \pi}{4} < 4,$ $\lfloor r \rfloor = \boxed{3}.$
From the angle addition formula, we can write
\begin{align*}
\sin x + \cos x &= \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sin x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cos x \right) \\
&= \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{\pi}{4} \sin x + \sin \frac{\pi}{4} \cos x \right) \\
&= \sqrt{2} \sin \left( x + \frac{\pi}{4} \right).
\end{align*}Thus, the graph of $y = \sin x + \cos x$ has period $\boxed{2 \pi}.$
The graph of $y = \sin x + \cos x$ is shown below:

We will examine the first term in the expression we want to evaluate, $\frac{\sin 2x}{\sin 2y}$, separately from the second term, $\frac{\cos 2x}{\cos 2y}$
Using the identity $\sin 2\theta = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta$, we have $$\frac{2\sin x \cos x}{2\sin y \cos y} = \frac{\sin x \cos x}{\sin y \cos y} = \frac{\sin x}{\sin y}\cdot\frac{\cos x}{\cos y}=3\cdot\frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}.$$Let the equation $\frac{\sin x}{\sin y} = 3$ be equation 1, and let the equation $\frac{\cos x}{\cos y} = \frac12$ be equation 2
To use the identity $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$, we will cross multiply equation 1 by $\sin y$ and multiply equation 2 by $\cos y$
Equation 1 then becomes $\sin x = 3\sin y$
Equation 2 then becomes $\cos x = \frac{1}{2} \cos y.$ We can square both of the resulting equations and match up the resulting LHS with the resulting RHS and get $$1 = 9\sin^2 y + \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 y.$$Applying the identity $\cos^2 y = 1 - \sin^2 y$, we can change $1 = 9\sin^2 y + \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 y$ into $$1 = 9\sin^2 y + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} \sin^2 y.$$Rearranging, we get $\frac{3}{4} = \frac{35}{4} \sin^2 y $
Therefore, $\sin^2 y = \frac{3}{35}$
Squaring Equation 1 (leading to $\sin^2 x = 9\sin^2 y$), we can solve for $\sin^2 x$ as follows: $$\sin^2 x = 9\left(\frac{3}{35}\right) = \frac{27}{35}.$$Using the identity $\cos 2\theta = 1 - 2\sin^2\theta$, we can solve for $\frac{\cos 2x}{\cos 2y}$:
\begin{align*}
\cos 2x &= 1 - 2\sin^2 x = 1 - 2\cdot\frac{27}{35} = 1 - \frac{54}{35} = -\frac{19}{35}, \\
\cos 2y &= 1 - 2\sin^2 y = 1 - 2\cdot\frac{3}{35} = 1 - \frac{6}{35} = \frac{29}{35}.
\end{align*}Hence, $\frac{\cos 2x}{\cos 2y} = \frac{-19/35}{29/35} = -\frac{19}{29}$.
Finally,
\[\frac{\sin 2x}{\sin 2y} + \frac{\cos 2x}{\cos 2y} = \frac32 + \left(-\frac{19}{29} \right) = \boxed{\frac{49}{58}}.\]
Let $O$ be center of the first sphere, and let $P$ be the center of the second sphere
\[OP = \sqrt{(-2 - 12)^2 + (-10 - 8)^2 + (5 - (-16))^2} = 31.\][asy]
unitsize(1 cm);
pair A, B, O, P;
O = (0,0);
P = 8*dir(15);

draw(Circle(P,2));
draw(A--B);
label("$A$", A, W);
label("$B$", B, E);
dot("$O$", O, S);

[/asy]
Let $A$ be a point on the first sphere, and let $B$ be a point on the second sphere
Then by the Triangle Inequality,
\[AB \le AO + OP + PB = 19 + 31 + 87 = 137.\]We can achieve this by taking $A$ and $B$ to be the intersections of line $OP$ with the spheres, as shown above
Hence, the largest possible distance is $\boxed{137}.$
The portion of the path for $-\frac{5 \pi}{2} \le t \le \frac{7 \pi}{2}$ is shown below
The corresponding value of $t$ is labelled for certain points.
unitsize(1 cm);
pair moo (real t) {
return (cos(t) + t/2, sin(t));
real t;
path foo = moo(-5/2*pi);
for (t = -5/2*pi; t <= 7/2*pi; t = t + 0.1) {
foo = foo--moo(t);
draw(foo,red);
dot("$-\frac{5 \pi}{2}$", moo(-5/2*pi), S);
dot("$-\frac{3 \pi}{2}$", moo(-3/2*pi), N);
dot("$-\frac{\pi}{2}$", moo(-1/2*pi), S);
dot("$\frac{\pi}{2}$", moo(1/2*pi), N);

dot("$\frac{5 \pi}{2}$", moo(5/2*pi), N);
dot("$\frac{7 \pi}{2}$", moo(7/2*pi), S);
[/asy]
Thus, the path "repeats" with a period of $2 \pi$ (in $t$), and the path intersects itself once each period
The $x$-coordinates of the points of intersection are of the form $\frac{(4n + 1) \pi}{4},$ where $n$ is an integer
We note that
\[1 \le \frac{(4n + 1) \pi}{4} \le 40\]for $n = 1,$ $2,$ $\dots,$ $12,$ giving us $\boxed{12}$ points of intersection.
Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$ all the plotted points lie on the line $x + y = 1.$  The answer is $\boxed{\text{(A)}}.$
We have that $\rho = 3,$ $\theta = \frac{5 \pi}{12},$ and $\phi = 0,$ so
\begin{align*}
x &= \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta = 3 \sin 0 \cos \frac{5 \pi}{12} = 0, \\
y &= \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta = 3 \sin 0 \sin \frac{5 \pi}{12} = 0, \\
z &= \rho \cos \phi = 3 \cos 0 = 3.
\end{align*}Therefore, the rectangular coordinates are $\boxed{(0,0,3)}.$
Since the projection of $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$ onto $\mathbf{w}$ is $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1/2 \\ 1/2 \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{w}$ must be a scalar multiple of $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1/2 \\ 1/2 \end{pmatrix}.$  Furthermore, the projection of a vector onto $\mathbf{w}$ is the same as the projection of the same vector onto any nonzero scalar multiple of $\mathbf{w}$ (because this projection depends only on the direction of $\mathbf{w}$).
Thus, the projection of $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ onto $\mathbf{w}$ is the same as the projection of $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ onto $2 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1/2 \\ 1/2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},$ which is
\[\frac{\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 \\ -1/6 \\ 1/6 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
If $r = \sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta},$ then $x = r \cos \theta = 1.$  Thus, the graph of $r = \sec \theta$ is simply the line $x = 1.$
If $r = \csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta},$ then $y = r \sin \theta = 1.$  Thus, the graph of $r = \csc \theta$ is simply the line $y = 1.$

Hence, the region we are interested in is simply the square with vertices $(0,0),$ $(1,0),$ $(1,1),$ and $(0,1),$ which has area $\boxed{1}.$
Note that
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^2 &= \begin{pmatrix}  -1 & 2 \\  3 & 4  \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}  -1 & 2 \\  3 & 4  \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix}  7 & 6 \\ 9 & 22 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= 3 \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} + 10 \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= 3 \mathbf{A} + 10 \mathbf{I}.
\end{align*}Squaring the equation $\mathbf{A}^2 = 3 \mathbf{A} + 10 \mathbf{I},$ we get
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^4 &= (3 \mathbf{A} + 10 \mathbf{I})^2 \\
&= 9 \mathbf{A}^2 + 60 \mathbf{A} + 100 \mathbf{I} \\
&= 9 (3 \mathbf{A} + 10 \mathbf{I}) + 60 \mathbf{A} + 100 \mathbf{I} \\
&= 87 \mathbf{A} + 190 \mathbf{I}.
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^6 &= \mathbf{A}^4 \cdot \mathbf{A}^2 \\
&= (87 \mathbf{A} + 190 \mathbf{I})(3 \mathbf{A} + 10 \mathbf{I}) \\
&= 261 \mathbf{A}^2 + 1440 \mathbf{A} + 1900 \mathbf{I} \\
&= 261 (3 \mathbf{A} + 10 \mathbf{I}) + 1440 \mathbf{A} + 1900 \mathbf{I} \\
&= 2223 \mathbf{A} + 4510 \mathbf{I}.
\end{align*}Thus, $(p,q) = \boxed{(2223,4510)}.$
By the double-angle formula,
\[\cos \theta = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - 2 \cdot \frac{x - 1}{2x} = \frac{1}{x}.\]Since $\theta$ is acute,
\[\sin \theta = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{x^2}},\]so
\[\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = \frac{\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{x^2}}}{\frac{1}{x}} = x \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{x^2}} = \boxed{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}.\]
The projection of $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \\ z \end{pmatrix}$ onto $\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 5 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ is
\[\frac{\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \\ z \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 5 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 5 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 5 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 5 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{-z + 15}{35} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.\]Then $-z + 15 = 12,$ so $z = \boxed{3}.$
In rectangular coordinates, $\left( 2 \sqrt{3}, \frac{2 \pi}{3} \right)$ becomes
\[\left( 2 \sqrt{3} \cos \frac{2 \pi}{3}, 2 \sqrt{3} \sin \frac{2 \pi}{3} \right) = \boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, 3)}.\]
In spherical coordinates, $\phi$ is the angle between a point and the positive $z$-axis.

A point on the first plane is $(-1,0,0).$  Then from the formula for the distance from a point to a plane, the distance from $(-1,0,0)$ to the plane $2x + 4y - 4z + 5 = 0$ is
\[\frac{|(2)(-1) + (4)(0) + (-4)(0) + 5|}{\sqrt{2^2 + 4^2 + (-4)^2}} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.\](Note that we can write the equation of the second plane as $x + 2y - 2z + \frac{5}{2} = 0.$  Thus, both planes have the same normal vector, so they are parallel.)
We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} 1 & -3 & 3 \\ 0 & 5 & -1 \\ 4 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} &= \begin{vmatrix} 5 & -1 \\ -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} - (-3) \begin{vmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 4 & 1 \end{vmatrix} + 3 \begin{vmatrix} 0 & 5 \\ 4 & -2 \end{vmatrix} \\
&= ((5)(1) - (-1)(-2)) + 3 ((0)(1) - (-1)(4)) + 3 ((0)(-2) - (5)(4)) \\
&= \boxed{-45}.
\end{align*}We can also expand along the first column, to take advantage of the 0 in the first column, to get
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} 1 & -3 & 3 \\ 0 & 5 & -1 \\ 4 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} &= \begin{vmatrix} 5 & -1 \\ -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} + 4 \begin{vmatrix} -3 & 3 \\ 5 & -1 \end{vmatrix} \\
&= ((5)(1) - (-1)(-2)) + 4((-3)(-1) - (3)(5)) \\
&= \boxed{-45}.
\end{align*}
Note that \begin{align*}(\sin t+i\cos t)^n
&=\left[\cos\left({{\pi}\over2}-t\right)
+i\sin\left({{\pi}\over2}-t\right)\right]^n \\ &=\cos
n\left({{\pi}\over2}-t\right)+ i\sin
n\left({{\pi}\over2}-t\right) \\
&=\cos\left({{n\pi}\over2}-nt\right)+
i\sin\left({{n\pi}\over2}-nt\right),\end{align*}and that $\displaystyle
\sin nt+i\cos nt =\cos\left({{\pi}\over2}-nt\right)
+i\sin\left({{\pi}\over2}-nt\right)$
Thus the given condition is equivalent to $$\cos\left({{n\pi}\over2}-nt\right) =
\cos\left({{\pi}\over2}-nt\right) \quad {\rm and} \quad
\sin\left({{n\pi}\over2}-nt\right) =
\sin\left({{\pi}\over2}-nt\right).$$In general, $\cos\alpha=\cos\beta$ and $\sin\alpha=\sin\beta$ if and only if $\alpha -\beta=2\pi k$
Thus $$
{{n\pi}\over2}-nt-{{\pi}\over2}+nt=2\pi k,$$which yields $n=4k+1$
Because $1\le n\le1000$, conclude that $0\le k\le 249$, so there are $\boxed{250}$ values of $n$ that satisfy the given conditions.
Let us refer to the two given equations as equations (1) and (2), respectively
We can write them as
\[\frac{\sin x \cos x + \sin y \cos y}{\cos y \cos x} = 1\]and
\[\frac{\cos x \sin x + \cos y \sin y}{\sin y \sin x} = 6.\]Dividing these equations, we get $\frac{\sin x \sin y}{\cos x \cos y} = \frac{1}{6},$ so
\[\tan x \tan y = \frac{1}{6}.\]Multiplying equations (1) and (2), we get
\[\frac{\sin x \cos x}{\cos y \sin y} + 1 + 1 + \frac{\sin y \cos y}{\cos x \sin x} = 6,\]so
\[\frac{\sin x \cos x}{\sin y \cos y} + \frac{\sin y \cos y}{\sin x \cos x} = 4.\]We can write
\[\sin x \cos x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x} = \frac{\tan x}{\tan^2 x + 1}.\]It follows that
\[\frac{\tan x (\tan^2 y + 1)}{\tan y (\tan^2 x + 1)} + \frac{\tan y (\tan^2 x + 1)}{\tan x (\tan^2 y + 1)}  = 4.\]Since $\tan x \tan y = \frac{1}{6},$ this becomes
\[\frac{\frac{1}{6} \tan y + \tan x}{\frac{1}{6} \tan x + \tan y} + \frac{\frac{1}{6} \tan x + \tan y}{\frac{1}{6} \tan y + \tan x} = 4.\]This simplifies to $13 \tan^2 x - 124 \tan x \tan y + 13 \tan^2 y = 0,$ so
\[\tan^2 x + \tan^2 y = \frac{124}{13} \tan x \tan y = \frac{62}{39}.\]Therefore,
\[\frac{\tan x}{\tan y} + \frac{\tan y}{\tan x} = \frac{\tan^2 x + \tan^2 y}{\tan x \tan y} = \frac{62/39}{1/6} = \boxed{\frac{124}{13}}.\]
From $\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3},$ $(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) = 3.$  Expanding, we get
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 3.\]Then $1 + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 1 = 3,$ so $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \frac{1}{2}.$
Now, $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{b} + 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}),$ so
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} &= \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{b} + 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})) \\
&= \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 2 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 3 ((\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{b}).
\end{align*}Since $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is orthogonal to $\mathbf{b},$ this reduces to $\frac{1}{2} + 2 + 0 = \boxed{\frac{5}{2}}.$
From the formula for a projection,
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{w}} (5 \mathbf{v}) &= \frac{(5 \mathbf{v}) \cdot \mathbf{w}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|^2} \mathbf{w} \\
&= \frac{5 \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|^2} \mathbf{w} \\
&= 5 \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{w}} \mathbf{v} \\
&= 5 \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\ 10 \end{pmatrix}}.
\end{align*}
The area of the triangle formed by $\mathbf{0},$ $\mathbf{a},$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is half the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf{0},$ $\mathbf{a},$ $\mathbf{b},$ and $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}.$

The area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf{0},$ $\mathbf{a},$ $\mathbf{b},$ and $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}$ is
\[|(5)(4) - (2)(1)| = 18,\]so the area of the triangle is $18/2 = \boxed{9}.$
Since $\sin \left( -\frac{\pi}{2} \right) = -1,$ $\arcsin (-1) = \boxed{-\frac{\pi}{2}}.$
We know that
\[e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta.\]Then
\[e^{-i \theta} = \cos (-\theta) + i \sin (-\theta) = \cos \theta - i \sin \theta.\]Adding these and dividing by 2, we get
\[\cos \theta = \frac{e^{i \theta} + e^{-i \theta}}{2}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\cos^5 \theta &= \frac{1}{32} (e^{i \theta} + e^{-i \theta})^5 \\
&= \frac{1}{32} (e^{5i \theta} + 5e^{3i \theta} + 10e^{i \theta} + 10e^{-i \theta} + 5e^{-3i \theta} + e^{-5i \theta}) \\
&= \frac{1}{16} \cos 5 \theta + \frac{5}{16} \cos 3 \theta + \frac{5}{8} \cos \theta.
\end{align*}Thus, $a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2 + a_5^2 = \left( \frac{1}{16} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{5}{16} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)^2 = \boxed{\frac{63}{128}}.$
From the equation $a^3 b^5 = 1,$ $a^6 b^{10} = 1.$  From the equation $a^7 b^2 = 1,$ $a^{35} b^{10} = 1.$  Dividing these equations, we get
\[a^{29} = 1.\]Therefore, $a$ must be a 29th root of unity.
From the equation $a^7 b^2 = 1,$ $a^{14} b^4 = 1.$  Hence,
\[\frac{a^3 b^5}{a^{14} b^4} = 1.\]This leads to $b = a^{11}.$
Conversely, if $a$ is a 29th root of unity, and $b = a^{11},$ then
\begin{align*}
a^3 b^5 &= a^3 (a^{11})^5 = a^{58} = 1, \\
a^7 b^2 &= a^7 (a^{11})^2 = a^{29} = 1.
\end{align*}Therefore, the solutions $(a,b)$ are of the form $(\omega, \omega^{11}),$ where $\omega$ is a 29th root of unity, giving us $\boxed{29}$ solutions.
In general, the vector triple product states that for any vectors $\mathbf{a},$ $\mathbf{b},$ and $\mathbf{c},$
\[\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) \mathbf{c}.\]So
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{i} \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{i}) &= (\mathbf{i} \cdot \mathbf{i}) \mathbf{v} - (\mathbf{i} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{i} = \mathbf{v} - (\mathbf{i} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{i}, \\
\mathbf{j} \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{j}) &= (\mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{j}) \mathbf{v} - (\mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{j} = \mathbf{v} - (\mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{j}, \\
\mathbf{k} \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{k}) &= (\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{k}) \mathbf{v} - (\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{k} = \mathbf{v} - (\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{k}.
\end{align*}Hence,
\begin{align*}
&\mathbf{i} \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{i}) + \mathbf{j} \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{j}) + \mathbf{k} \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{k}) \\
&= 3 \mathbf{v} - ((\mathbf{i} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{i} + (\mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{j} + (\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{k}) \\
&= 3 \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{v} = 2 \mathbf{v}.
\end{align*}Thus, $c = \boxed{2}.$
Here is a plot of the line:
size(200);
import TrigMacros;
//Gives the maximum line that fits in the box
path maxLine(pair A, pair B, real xmin, real xmax, real ymin, real ymax)
pair[] endpoints = intersectionpoints(A+10(B-A) -- A-10(B-A), (xmin, ymin)--(xmin, ymax)--(xmax, ymax)--(xmax, ymin)--cycle);
if (endpoints.length >= 2) return endpoints[0]--endpoints[1];
else return nullpath;
rr_cartesian_axes(-3, 9, -3, 6,complexplane=false,usegrid=true);
pair A = (2, 2);
pair B = (6,3);
draw(maxLine(A, B, -3, 9, -3, 6));
[/asy]
We need a vector pointing from the origin to the line in the direction of $\begin{pmatrix}2\\1\end{pmatrix}$
That means that the tail of the vector will be at the origin, and the head of the vector will be somewhere on this blue line:
size(200);
import TrigMacros;
//Gives the maximum line that fits in the box
path maxLine(pair A, pair B, real xmin, real xmax, real ymin, real ymax)
pair[] endpoints = intersectionpoints(A+10(B-A) -- A-10(B-A), (xmin, ymin)--(xmin, ymax)--(xmax, ymax)--(xmax, ymin)--cycle);
if (endpoints.length >= 2) return endpoints[0]--endpoints[1];
else return nullpath;
rr_cartesian_axes(-3,9,-3,6,complexplane=false,usegrid=true);
pair A = (2, 2);
pair B = (6,3);
draw(maxLine(A, B, -3, 9, -3, 6));
draw(maxLine((0,0), B, -3, 9, -3, 6), blue);
[/asy]
Since the head of the vector needs to be on the black line as well, it must be the intersection point of the two lines.
The lines intersect when
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = k \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2k \\ k \end{pmatrix}\]for some real number $k.$  In other words, $4t + 2 = 2k$ and $t + 2 = k.$  Solving, we find $t = 1$ and $k = 3.$  Therefore, the lines intersect at $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix}6\\3\end{pmatrix}}.$
size(200);
import TrigMacros;
//Gives the maximum line that fits in the box
path maxLine(pair A, pair B, real xmin, real xmax, real ymin, real ymax)
pair[] endpoints = intersectionpoints(A+10(B-A) -- A-10(B-A), (xmin, ymin)--(xmin, ymax)--(xmax, ymax)--(xmax, ymin)--cycle);
if (endpoints.length >= 2) return endpoints[0]--endpoints[1];
else return nullpath;
rr_cartesian_axes(-3,9,-3,6,complexplane=false,usegrid=true);
pair A = (2, 2);
pair B = (6,3);
draw(maxLine(A, B, -3, 9, -3, 6));
draw((0,0)--B, red, Arrow(size = 0.3cm));
[/asy]
The line passing through $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ can be parameterized by
\[\mathbf{a} + t (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}).\]Taking $t = \frac{3}{4},$ we get
\[\mathbf{a} + \frac{3}{4} (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) = \frac{1}{4} \mathbf{a} + \frac{3}{4} \mathbf{b}.\]Thus, $k = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}.$
Note that
\[\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 7 & -3 \end{vmatrix} = (2)(-3) - (1)(7) = -13,\]so the matrix scales the area of any region by a factor of $|-13| = 13.$  In particular, the area of $S'$ is $13 \cdot 10 = \boxed{130}.$
We can distribute, to get
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{M} (-2 \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) &= \mathbf{M} (-2 \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{M} \mathbf{w} \\
&= -2 \mathbf{M} \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{M} \mathbf{w} \\
&= -2 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix}}.
\end{align*}
Since $\mathbf{m}$ is the midpoint of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b},$
\[\mathbf{m} = \frac{\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}}{2}.\]Hence, $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = 2 \mathbf{m} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 14 \end{pmatrix}.$  Then
\[\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\|^2 = \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 14 \end{pmatrix} \right\|^2 = 6^2  + 14^2 = 232.\]But
\begin{align*}
\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\|^2 &= (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \\
&= \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} \\
&= \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2,
\end{align*}so
\[\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\|^2 - 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 232 - 2 \cdot 6 = \boxed{220}.\]
We have that
\[\mathbf{M}^T \mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & x & x \\ 2y & y & -y \\ z & -z & z \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2y & z \\ x & y & -z \\ x & -y & z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 6y^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3z^2 \end{pmatrix}.\]We want this to equal $\mathbf{I},$ so $2x^2 = 6y^2 = 3z^2 = 1.$  Hence,
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} = \boxed{1}.\]
Let $d = \|\mathbf{a}\| = \|\mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\|.$  Then
\begin{align*}
d^2 &= \|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\|^2 \\
&= (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \\
&= \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} \\
&= \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 \\
&= 2d^2 + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b},
\end{align*}so $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = -\frac{d^2}{2}.$
Hence, if $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b},$ then
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{-\frac{d^2}{2}}{d^2} = -\frac{1}{2},\]so $\theta = \boxed{120^\circ}.$
Converting to degrees,
\[\frac{9 \pi}{4} = \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \cdot \frac{9 \pi}{4} = 405^\circ.\]Since the tangent function has period $360^\circ,$ $\tan 405^\circ = \tan (405^\circ - 360^\circ) = \tan 45^\circ = \boxed{1}.$
We know that $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1.$  Squaring, we get
\[\sin^4 x + 2 \sin^2 x \cos^2 x + \cos^4 x = 1.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= (\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x) - \sin x \cos x \\
&= (1 - 2 \sin^2 x \cos^2 x) - \sin x \cos x \\
&= 1 - \frac{1}{2} \sin 2x - \frac{1}{2} \sin^2 2x \\
&= \frac{9}{8} - \frac{1}{2} \left( \sin 2x + \frac{1}{2} \right)^2.
\end{align*}Since the range of $\sin x$ is $[-1,1],$ the range of $f(x)$ reaches a minimum when $\sin 2x = 1,$ in which case $f(x) = 0,$ and a maximum when $\sin 2x = -\frac{1}{2},$ in which case $f(x) = \frac{9}{8}.$  Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{\left[ 0, \frac{9}{8} \right]}.$
Let the line be
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{a} + t \mathbf{d}.\]Then from the given information,
\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{d}, \\
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{a} + 3 \mathbf{d}.
\end{align*}We can treat this system as a linear set of equations in $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{d}.$  Accordingly, we can solve to get $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 20 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -8 \end{pmatrix}.$  Hence,
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 20 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -8 \end{pmatrix}.\]Taking $t = -7,$ we get
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 20 \end{pmatrix} - 7 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -8 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -17 \\ 76 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
All points that make an angle of $\frac{\pi}{3}$ with the positive $x$-axis lie on the graph.

But all points that make an angle of $\frac{\pi}{3} + \pi$ with the positive $x$-axis also lie on the graph, since the radius $r$ can be negative
Thus, the graph is a line
The answer is $\boxed{\text{(A)}}.$
Place the cube in space so that $A$ is at the origin, and the three vertices adjacent to $A$ are $(10,0,0),$ $(0,10,0),$ and $(0,0,10).$  Let the equation of the plane be
\[ax + by + cz + d = 0,\]where $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1.$  Then, the (directed) distance from any point $(x,y,z)$ to the plane is $ax+by+cz+d.$

So, by looking at the three vertices, we have $10a+d=10,$ $10b+d=11,$ and $10c+d=12.$  Then $10a = 10 - d,$ $10b = 11 - d,$ and $10c = 12 - d,$ so
\[(10-d)^2+(11-d)^2+(12-d)^2= 100\cdot(a^2+b^2+c^2)=100.\]Solving for $d,$ we find
\[d = 11 \pm 7 \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}.\]Note that the distance from the origin to the plane is $d,$ which must be less than 10, so
\[d = 11 - 7 \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{33 - \sqrt{294}}{3}.\]The final answer is $33+294+3=\boxed{330}$.
The distance between $(2,1,-4)$ and $(5,8,-3)$ is
\[\sqrt{(2 - 5)^2 + (1 - 8)^2 + (-4 + 3)^2} = \boxed{\sqrt{59}}.\]
From the equation $\cos a + \cos b = \frac{1}{2},$ by sum-to-product,
\[2 \cos \left( \frac{a + b}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{a - b}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{2}.\]Similarly, from the equation $\sin a + \sin b = \frac{3}{11},$
\[2 \sin \left( \frac{a + b}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{a - b}{2} \right) = \frac{3}{11}.\]Dividing these equations, we get
\[\tan \left( \frac{a + b}{2} \right) = \boxed{\frac{6}{11}}.\]
Note that $x^7 = \cos 2 \pi + i \sin 2 \pi = 1,$ so $x^7 - 1 = 0,$ which factors as
\[(x - 1)(x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) = 0.\]Since $x \neq 1,$
\[x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0.\]Then
\begin{align*}
(2x + x^2)(2x^6 + x^{12}) &= 4x^7 + 2x^8 + 2x^{13} + x^{14} = 4 + 2x + 2x^6 + 1 = 5 + 2x + 2x^6, \\
(2x^2 + x^4)(2x^5 + x^{10}) &= 4x^7 + 2x^9 + 2x^{12} + x^{14} = 4 + 2x^2 + 2x^5 + 1 = 5 + 2x^2 + 2x^5, \\
(2x^3 + x^6)(2x^4 + x^8) &= 4x^7 + 2x^{10} + 2x^{11} + x^{14} = 4 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + 1 = 5 + 2x^3 + 2x^4.
\end{align*}Let $\alpha = x + x^6,$ $\beta = x^2 + x^5,$ and $\gamma = x^3 + x^4,$ so we want to compute
\[(5 + 2 \alpha)(5 + 2 \beta)(5 + 2 \gamma).\]Then
\[\alpha + \beta + \gamma = x + x^6 + x^2 + x^5 + x^3 + x^4 = -1.\]Also,
\begin{align*}
\alpha \beta + \alpha \gamma + \beta \gamma &= (x + x^6)(x^2 + x^5) + (x + x^6)(x^3 + x^4) + (x^2 + x^5)(x^3 + x^4) \\
&= x^3 + x^6 + x^8 + x^{11} + x^4 + x^5 + x^9 + x^{10} + x^5 + x^6 + x^8 + x^9 \\
&= x^3 + x^6 + x + x^4 + x^4 + x^5 + x^2 + x^3 + x^5 + x^6 + x + x^2 \\
&= 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + 2x^5 + 2x^6 \\
\end{align*}and
\begin{align*}
\alpha \beta \gamma &= (x + x^6)(x^2 + x^5)(x^3 + x^4) \\
&= (x^3 + x^6 + x^8 + x^{11})(x^3 + x^4) \\
&= (x^3 + x^6 + x + x^4)(x^3 + x^4) \\
&= x^6 + x^9 + x^4 + x^7 + x^7 + x^{10} + x^5 + x^8 \\
&= x^6 + x^2 + x^4 + 1 + 1 + x^3 + x^5 + x \\
\end{align*}Therefore,
\begin{align*}
(5 + 2 \alpha)(5 + 2 \beta)(5 + 2 \gamma) &= 125 + 50 (\alpha + \beta + \gamma) + 20 (\alpha \beta + \alpha \gamma + \beta \gamma) + 8 \alpha \beta \gamma \\
&= 125 + 50(-1) + 20(-2) + 8(1) \\
&= \boxed{43}.
\end{align*}
We can re-write the first equation as
\[x = \frac{w+z}{1-wz}.\]which is an indication to consider trigonometric substitution.
Let $x = \tan a,$ $y = \tan b,$ $z = \tan c,$ and $w = \tan d,$ where $-90^{\circ} < a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d < 90^{\circ}$
\[\tan a = \frac{\tan d + \tan c}{1 - \tan d \tan c} = \tan (c + d).\]Similarly,
\begin{align*}
\tan b &= \tan (d + a), \\
\tan c &= \tan (a + b), \\
\tan d &= \tan (b + c).
\end{align*}Since the tangent function has period $180^\circ,$
\begin{align*}
a &\equiv c + d, \\
b &\equiv d + a, \\
c &\equiv a + b, \\
d &\equiv b + c,
\end{align*}where all the congruences are taken modulo $180^\circ.$  Adding all these congruences, we get $a + b + c + d \equiv 0.$  Then
\[a \equiv c + d \equiv -a - b,\]so $b \equiv -2a.$  Similarly, $c \equiv -2b,$ $d \equiv -2c,$ and $a \equiv -2d.$  Then
\[a \equiv -2d \equiv 4c \equiv -8b \equiv 16a,\]so $15a \equiv 0.$  Hence, $(a,b,c,d) \equiv (t,-2t,4t,-8t),$ where $15t \equiv 0.$  Since $a \equiv c + d,$
\[t \equiv 4t - 8t \equiv -4t,\]so $5t \equiv 0.$  We can check that this condition always leads to a solution, giving us $\boxed{5}$ solutions.
Note: We divided the first equation to get
\[x = \frac{w + z}{1 - wz},\]so we should check that $wz \neq 1$ for all five solutions
If $wz = 1,$ then from the equation $x = z + w + zwx,$
\[z + w = 0.\]Then $wz = -w^2,$ which cannot be equal to 1, contradiction
The same holds for the division in the other equations.
Since $\sin 66^\circ = \cos 24^\circ$ and $\sin 78^\circ = \cos 12^\circ,$ the product is equal to
\[\sin 6^\circ \cos 12^\circ \cos 24^\circ \sin 42^\circ.\]Then
\[\sin 6^\circ \cos 12^\circ \cos 24^\circ \sin 42^\circ = \frac{\cos 6^\circ \sin 6^\circ \cos 12^\circ \cos 24^\circ \sin 42^\circ}{\cos 6^\circ}.\]By the double-angle formula, $2 \cos 6^\circ \sin 6^\circ = \sin 12^\circ,$ so
\[\frac{\cos 6^\circ \sin 6^\circ \cos 12^\circ \cos 24^\circ \sin 42^\circ}{\cos 6^\circ} = \frac{\sin 12^\circ \cos 12^\circ \cos 24^\circ \sin 42^\circ}{2 \cos 6^\circ}.\]From the same formula,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin 12^\circ \cos 12^\circ \cos 24^\circ \sin 42^\circ}{2 \cos 6^\circ} &= \frac{\sin 24^\circ \cos 24^\circ \sin 42^\circ}{4 \cos 6^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\sin 48^\circ \sin 42^\circ}{8 \cos 6^\circ}.
\end{align*}Then
\[\frac{\sin 48^\circ \sin 42^\circ}{8 \cos 6^\circ} = \frac{\cos 42^\circ \sin 42^\circ}{8 \cos 6^\circ} = \frac{\sin 84^\circ}{16 \cos 6^\circ} = \frac{\cos 6^\circ}{16 \cos 6^\circ} = \boxed{\frac{1}{16}}.\]
From the angle addition formula,
\[1 = \tan 45^\circ = \tan (20^\circ + 25^\circ) = \frac{\tan 20^\circ + \tan 25^\circ}{1 - \tan 20^\circ \tan 25^\circ},\]so $\tan 20^\circ + \tan 25^\circ = 1 - \tan 20^\circ \tan 25^\circ.$
\[(1 + \tan 20^\circ)(1 + \tan 25^\circ) = 1 + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 25^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 25^\circ = \boxed{2}.\]
Note that the dot product of $\mathbf{a}$ and $(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) \mathbf{c}$ is
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot [(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) \mathbf{c}] = (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) = 0.\]Therefore, the angle between the vectors is $\boxed{90^\circ}.$
Note that $\arctan \frac{1}{4}$ is the argument of $4 + i,$ $\arctan \frac{1}{20}$ is the argument of $20 + i,$ and $\arctan x$ is the argument of $x + i.$  Therefore, $3 \arctan \frac{1}{4} + \arctan \frac{1}{20} + \arctan \frac{1}{x}$ is the argument of
\begin{align*}
(4 + i)^3 (20 + i)(x + i) &= (52 + 47i)(20 + i)(x + i) \\
&= (993 + 992i)(x + i) \\
&= (993x - 992) + (993 + 992x) i.
\end{align*}But this argument is also $\frac{\pi}{4},$ which is the argument of $1 + i.$  Thus, we want the real and imaginary parts to be equal:
\[993x - 992 = 993 + 992x.\]Solving, find $x = \boxed{1985}.$
If $(x,y,z)$ lies inside the first sphere, then
\[x^2 + y^2 + \left( z - \frac{21}{2} \right)^2 \le 36,\]and if $(x,y,z)$ lies inside the second sphere, then
\[x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 \le \frac{81}{4}.\]Thus, we are looking for the number of lattice points that satisfy both inequalities.
From the first inequality, $z - \frac{21}{2} \ge -6,$ so $z \ge \frac{9}{2}.$  From the second inequality, $z - 1 \le \frac{9}{2},$ so $z \le \frac{11}{2}.$  Since $z$ must be an integer, $z = 5.$  Then
\[x^2 + y^2 \le 36 - \left( 5 - \frac{21}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{23}{4}\]and
\[x^2 + y^2 \le \frac{81}{4} - (5 - 1)^2 = \frac{17}{4}.\]Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x^2 + y^2 \le 4.$
The possible pairs $(x,y)$ are then $(-2,0),$ $(-1,-1),$ $(-1,0),$ $(-1,1),$ $(0,-2),$ $(0,-1),$ $(0,0),$ $(0,1),$ $(0,2),$ $(1,-1),$ $(1,0),$ $(1,1),$ and $(2,0),$ giving us a total of $\boxed{13}$ points.
The transformation that reflects over the $x$-axis takes $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ to $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ to $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix},$ so the matrix is
\[\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
The area of the parallelogram is given by $|5 \cdot (-2) - 11 \cdot (-3)| = \boxed{23}.$
A $180^\circ$ rotation in the counter-clockwise direction corresponds to multiplication by $\operatorname{cis} 180^\circ = -1.$

dot("$-6 - 3i$", A, SW);
dot("$6 + 3i$", B,  NE);
[/asy]
Hence, the image of $-6 - 3i$ is $(-1)(-6 - 3i) = \boxed{6 + 3i}.$
Since the cosine function has period $360^\circ,$
\[\cos 259^\circ = \cos (259^\circ - 360^\circ) = \cos (-101^\circ).\]And since the cosine function is even, $\cos (-101^\circ) = \cos 101^\circ,$ so $n = \boxed{101}.$
Let $\mathbf{a}$ denote $\overrightarrow{A},$ etc.
Since $\overline{BE}$ is the angle bisector, by the Angle Bisector Theorem,
\[\frac{BD}{CD} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{7}{5},\]so $\mathbf{d} = \frac{5}{12} \mathbf{b} + \frac{7}{12} \mathbf{c}.$
Similarly,
\[\frac{AE}{CE} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{7}{3},\]so $\mathbf{e} = \frac{3}{10} \mathbf{a} + \frac{7}{10} \mathbf{c}.$

Isolating $\mathbf{c}$ in each equation, we obtain
\[\mathbf{c} = \frac{12 \mathbf{d} - 5 \mathbf{b}}{7} = \frac{10 \mathbf{e} - 3 \mathbf{a}}{7}.\]Then $12 \mathbf{d} - 5 \mathbf{b} = 10 \mathbf{e} - 3 \mathbf{a},$ so $3 \mathbf{a} + 12 \mathbf{d} = 5 \mathbf{b} + 10 \mathbf{e},$ or
\[\frac{3}{15} \mathbf{a} + \frac{12}{15} \mathbf{d} = \frac{5}{15} \mathbf{b} + \frac{10}{15} \mathbf{e}.\]Since the coefficients on both sides of the equation add up to 1, the vector on the left side lies on line $AD,$ and the vector on the right side lies on line $BE.$  Therefore, this common vector is $\mathbf{p}.$  Furthermore, $\frac{BP}{PE} = \frac{10}{5} = \boxed{2}.$
Since the cross product is distributive,
\[\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{b}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\ 12 \\ -21 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix},$ let $\mathbf{r}$ be the reflection of $\mathbf{v}$ over $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},$ and let $\mathbf{p}$ be the projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.$
Note that $\mathbf{p}$ is the midpoint of $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{r}.$  Thus, we can use $\mathbf{p}$ to compute the reflection matrix.
unitsize(1 cm);

D = (3,2);
V = (1.5,2);
R = reflect((0,0),D)*(V);

[/asy]
From the projection formula,
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{p} &= \operatorname{proj}_{\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{3x + 2y}{13} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} \frac{9x + 6y}{13} \\ \frac{6x + 4y}{13} \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}Since $\mathbf{p}$ is the midpoint of $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{r},$
\[\mathbf{p} = \frac{\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{r}}{2}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{r} &= 2 \mathbf{p} - \mathbf{v} \\
&= 2 \begin{pmatrix} \frac{9x + 6y}{13} \\ \frac{6x + 4y}{13} \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} \frac{5x + 12y}{13} \\ \frac{12x - 5y}{13} \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} 5/13 & 12/13 \\ 12/13 & -5/13 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}Thus, the matrix is $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 5/13 & 12/13 \\ 12/13 & -5/13 \end{pmatrix}}.$
From the angle addition formula,
\begin{align*}
\tan \left( x + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) &= \frac{\tan x + \tan \frac{\pi}{4}}{1 - \tan x \tan \frac{\pi}{4}} \\
&= \frac{1 + 2}{1 - 2 \cdot 1} \\
&= \boxed{-3}.
\end{align*}
We have that
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 11 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 + (-6) \\ (-7) + 11 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Squaring both equations, we get
\begin{align*}
9 \sin^2 A + 24 \sin A \cos B + 16 \cos^2 B &= 36, \\
9 \cos^2 A + 24 \cos A \sin B + 16 \sin^2 B &= 1.
\end{align*}Adding these equations, and using the identity $\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1,$ we get
\[24 \sin A \cos B + 24 \cos A \sin B = 12,\]so
\[\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2}.\]Then from the angle addition formula, $\sin (A + B) = \frac{1}{2},$ so
\[\sin C = \sin (180^\circ - A - B) = \sin (A + B) = \frac{1}{2}.\]Hence, $C = 30^\circ$ or $C = 150^\circ.$
If $C = 150^\circ,$ then $A < 30^\circ,$ so
\[3 \sin A + 4 \cos B < 3 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 4 < 6,\]contradiction
Hence, the only possible value of $C$ is $\boxed{30^\circ}.$
There exists a triangle $ABC$ that does satisfy the given conditions; in this triangle, $\cos A = \frac{5 - 12 \sqrt{3}}{37}$ and $\cos B = \frac{66 - 3 \sqrt{3}}{74}.$
Note that $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ are two points on this line, so a possible direction vector is
\[\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.\]Then any nonzero scalar multiple of $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ can also be a direction vector.
The form
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{v} + t \mathbf{d}\]parameterizes a line if and only if $\mathbf{v}$ lies on the line, and $\mathbf{d}$ is a possible direction vector for the line
Checking, we find that the possible parameterizations are $\boxed{\text{A,C}}.$
Since $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{A},$
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}.\]Expanding, we get
\[\begin{pmatrix} a + 2c & b + 2d \\ 3a + 4c & 3b + 4d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a + 3b & 2a + 4b \\ c + 3d & 2c + 4d \end{pmatrix}.\]Comparing entries, we find $3b = 2c$ and $3a + 3c = 3d,$ so $a + c = d.$  Then
\[\frac{a - d}{c - 3b} = \frac{-c}{c - 2c} = \frac{-c}{-c} = \boxed{1}.\]
We have that
\[\begin{pmatrix} a \\ -1 \\ c \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -3c - 5 \\ -5a + 7c \\ 3a + 7 \end{pmatrix}.\]Comparing entries, we get $-3c - 5 = -11,$ $-5a + 7c = -16,$ and $3a + 7 = 25.$  Solving, we find $(a,c) = \boxed{(6,2)}.$
A matrix is not invertible if and only its determinant is 0
This gives us the equation
\[(1 + x)(8) - (7)(3 - x) = 0.\]Solving, we find $x = \boxed{\frac{13}{15}}.$
Using the double angle formula, we can write
\begin{align*}
8 \sin x \cos^5 x - 8 \sin^5 x \cos x &= 8 \sin x \cos x (\cos^4 x - \sin^4 x) \\
&= 8 \sin x \cos x (\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x)(\cos^2 x - \sin^2 x) \\
&= 4 \sin 2x \cos 2x \\
&= 2 \sin 4x,
\end{align*}so $\sin 4x = \frac{1}{2}.$  Since $\sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2},$ the smallest such $x$ is $\boxed{7.5^\circ}.$
From the product-to-sum identities,
\[\frac{\sin{10^\circ}+\sin{20^\circ}}{\cos{10^\circ}+\cos{20^\circ}} = \frac{2 \sin 15^\circ \cos (-5^\circ)}{2 \cos 15^\circ \cos(-5^\circ)} = \frac{\sin 15^\circ}{\cos 15^\circ} = \boxed{\tan 15^\circ}.\]
We place the diagram in the complex plane, so that the vertices $A$, $A'$, $B$, $B'$, $C$, and $C'$ go to the complex numbers $a$, $a'$, $b$, $b'$, $c$, and $c'$, respectively.
To get to $a'$, we rotate the line segment joining $b$ to $c$ by $90^\circ$ (which we achieve by multiplying $c - b$ by $i$)
Also, we want $AA' = kBC$, so we multiply this complex number by $k$ as well
Hence,
\[a' = a + ki(c - b).\]Similarly,
\begin{align*}
b' &= b + ki(a - c), \\
c' &= c + ki(b - a).

We want triangle $A'B'C'$ to be equilateral, so we want $a'$, $b'$, and $c'$ to satisfy
\[c' - a' = e^{\pi i/3} (b' - a').\]Substituting our expressions for $a'$, $b'$, and $c'$, and using the fact that
\[e^{\pi i/3} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i,\]we get
\[c + ki(b - a) - a - ki(c - b) = \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i \right) [b + ki(a - c) - a - ki(c - b)].\]Expanding and simplifying both sides, we get
\begin{align*}
&(-1 - ki) a + 2ki b + (1 - ki) c \\
&= \frac{-k \sqrt{3} - 1 + ki - i \sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot a + \frac{- k \sqrt{3} + 1 + ki + i \sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot b + (k \sqrt{3} - ki) c.
\end{align*}We want the coefficients of $a$, $b$, and $c$ to be equal on both sides
Equating the coefficients of $c$, we get
\[1 - ki = k \sqrt{3} - ki,\]so $k = 1/\sqrt{3}$
For this value of $k$, both coefficients of $a$ become $-1 - i/\sqrt{3}$, and both coefficients of $b$ become $2i/\sqrt{3}$.
Hence, the value of $k$ that works is $k = \boxed{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}$.
We can write
\begin{align*}
(\sin x + \csc x)^2 + (\cos x + \sec x)^2 &= \sin^2 x + 2 + \csc^2 x + \cos^2 x + 2 + \sec^2 x \\
&= \csc^2 x + \sec^2 x + 5 \\

&= \frac{\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x}{\sin^2 x} + \frac{\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x} + 5 \\
&= \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x} + \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x} + 7 \\
&= \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x} - 2 + \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x} + 9 \\
&= \left( \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} \right)^2 + 9 \\
&\ge 9.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x = \frac{\pi}{4},$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{9}.$
We can write the first equation as
\[\frac{\cos^4 \alpha}{\cos^2 \beta} + \frac{\sin^4 \alpha}{\sin^2 \beta} = \cos^2 \alpha + \sin^2 \alpha.\]Then
\[\cos^4 \alpha \sin^2 \beta + \sin^4 \alpha \cos^2 \beta = \cos^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta \sin^2 \beta + \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta \sin^2 \beta,\]so
\[\cos^4 \alpha \sin^2 \beta + \sin^4 \alpha \cos^2 \beta - \cos^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta \sin^2 \beta - \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta \sin^2 \beta = 0.\]We can write this as
\[\cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta (\cos^2 \alpha - \cos^2 \beta) + \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta (\sin^2 \alpha - \sin^2 \beta) = 0.\]Note that
\[\sin^2 \alpha - \sin^2 \beta = (1 - \cos^2 \alpha) - (1 - \cos^2 \beta) = \cos^2 \beta - \cos^2 \alpha,\]so
\[\cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta (\cos^2 \alpha - \cos^2 \beta) - \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta (\cos^2 \alpha - \cos^2 \beta) = 0.\]Hence,
\[(\cos^2 \alpha - \cos^2 \beta)(\cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta - \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta) = 0.\]Therefore, either $\cos^2 \alpha = \cos^2 \beta$ or $\cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta = \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta.$
If $\cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta = \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta,$ then
\[\cos^2 \alpha (1 - \cos^2 \beta) = (1 - \cos^2 \alpha) \cos^2 \beta,\]which simplifies to $\cos^2 \alpha = \cos^2 \beta.$
So in either case, $\cos^2 \alpha = \cos^2 \beta.$  Then $\sin^2 \alpha = \sin^2 \beta,$ so
\[\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha} + \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \beta} + \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \beta} = \sin^2 \beta + \cos^2 \beta = \boxed{1}.\]
Taking $t = 0,$ we get $(x,y) = (b,d) = (-2,7),$ so $b = -2$ and $d = 7.$
Taking $t = 1,$ we get $(x,y) = (a + b, c + d) = (3,11),$ so $a + b = 3$ and $c + d = 11.$  Hence, $a = 5$ and $c = 4.$
Then $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 5^2 + (-2)^2 + 4^2 + 7^2 = \boxed{94}.$
We have that

\sin 60^\circ &= \cos 30^\circ, \\

-\cos 6^\circ &= \cos (180^\circ - 6^\circ) = \cos 174^\circ,
\end{align*}so
\[\cos \theta = \cos 30^\circ + \cos 318^\circ + \cos 102^\circ + \cos 174^\circ.\]If we plot $(\cos t, \sin t)$ for $t = 30^\circ,$ $102^\circ,$ $174^\circ,$ $246^\circ,$ and $318^\circ,$ the five points form the vertices of a regular pentagon.

\[\cos 30^\circ + \cos 102^\circ + \cos 174^\circ + \cos 246^\circ + \cos 318^\circ = 0.\]Thus,
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta &= -\cos 246^\circ \\
&= -\cos (360^\circ - 246^\circ) \\
&= -\cos 114^\circ \\
&= \cos (180^\circ - 114^\circ) \\
&= \cos 66^\circ.
\end{align*}Thus, the smallest such $\theta$ is $\boxed{66^\circ}.$
A projection matrix is always of the form
\[\begin{pmatrix} \cos^2 \theta & \cos \theta \sin \theta \\ \cos \theta \sin \theta & \sin^2 \theta \end{pmatrix},\]where the vector being projected onto has direction vector $\begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta \\ \sin \theta \end{pmatrix}.$  The determinant of this matrix is then
\[\cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \theta - (\cos \theta \sin \theta)^2 = 0,\]so the inverse does not exist, and the answer is the zero matrix $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}}.$
Let $A = \left( 8, \frac{5 \pi}{12} \right)$ and $B = \left( 8, -\frac{3 \pi}{12}\right).$  Note that both $A$ and $B$ lie on the circle with radius 8
Also, $\angle AOB = \frac{2 \pi}{3},$ where $O$ is the origin.
unitsize (0.3 cm);
pair A, B, M, O;
A = 8*dir(75);
B = 8*dir(-45);
O = (0,0);
M = (A + B)/2;
draw(Circle(O,8));
draw(A--B);
draw((-9,0)--(9,0));
draw((0,-9)--(0,9));

draw(O--M);
label("$A$", A, A/8);
label("$B$", B, B/8);
label("$O$", O, SW);
label("$M$", M, E);
[/asy]
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{AB}.$  Then $\angle AOM = \frac{\pi}{3}$ and $\angle AMO = \frac{\pi}{2},$ so $OM = \frac{AO}{2} = 4.$  Also, $\overline{OM}$ makes an angle of $\frac{5 \pi}{12} - \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}$ with the positive $x$-axis, so the polar coordinates of $M$ are $\boxed{\left( 4, \frac{\pi}{12} \right)}.$
We let $\mathbf{a} = \overrightarrow{A},$ etc
Then the equation $\overrightarrow{PA} + 2 \overrightarrow{PB} + 3 \overrightarrow{PC} = \mathbf{0}$ becomes
\[\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{p} + 2 (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{p}) + 3 (\mathbf{c} - \mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{0}.\]Solving for $\mathbf{p},$ we find
\[\mathbf{p} = \frac{\mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{b} + 3 \mathbf{c}}{6}.\]Let lines $BP$ and $AC$ intersect at $E.$
unitsize(0.6 cm);
pair A, B, C, E, P;
A = (2,5);
B = (0,0);
C = (6,0);
P = (A + 2*B + 3*C)/6;
E = extension(B,P,A,C);
draw(A--B--C--cycle);
draw(A--P);
draw(B--P);
draw(C--P);
draw(P--E);
label("$A$", A, N);
label("$B$", B, SW);
label("$C$", C, SE);
label("$E$", E, NE);
label("$P$", P, S);
[/asy]
From the equation $\mathbf{p} = \frac{\mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{b} + 3 \mathbf{c}}{6},$ $6 \mathbf{p} - 2 \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a} + 3 \mathbf{c},$ so
\[\frac{6}{4} \mathbf{p} - \frac{2}{4} \mathbf{b} = \frac{1}{4} \mathbf{a} + \frac{3}{4} \mathbf{c}.\]Since the coefficients on both sides of the equation add up to 1, the vector on the left side lies on line $BP,$ and the vector on the right side lies on line $AC.$  Therefore, this common vector is $\mathbf{e}$:
\[\mathbf{e} = \frac{6}{4} \mathbf{p} - \frac{2}{4} \mathbf{b} = \frac{3}{2} \mathbf{p} - \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{b}.\]Isolating $\mathbf{p},$ we find
\[\mathbf{p} = \frac{1}{3} \mathbf{b} + \frac{2}{3} \mathbf{e}.\]Therefore, $BP:PE = 2:1.$
Triangles $ABE$ and $APE$ have the same height with respect to base $\overline{BE},$ so
\[\frac{[ABE]}{[APE]} = \frac{BE}{PE} = 3.\]Similarly, triangles $CBE$ and $CPE$ have the same height with respect to base $\overline{BE}$, so
\[\frac{[CBE]}{[CPE]} = \frac{BE}{PE} = 3.\]Therefore,
\[\frac{[ABC]}{[APC]} = \frac{[ABE] + [CBE]}{[APE] + [CPE]} = \boxed{3}.\]
In general, the area of the parallelogram generated by two vectors $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ is
\[\|\mathbf{v}\| \|\mathbf{w}\| \sin \theta,\]where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}.$  This is precisely the magnitude of $\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}.$
Thus, the area of the parallelogram is
\[\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \left\| \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -14 \\ -10 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \boxed{10 \sqrt{3}}.\]
We have that $\det (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}) = (\det \mathbf{A})(\det \mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \boxed{24}.$
We have that $\sqrt{2} e^{11 \pi i/4} = \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{11 \pi}{4} + i \sqrt{2} \sin \frac{11 \pi}{4} = \boxed{-1 + i}$.
From the given equation, $z^2 + 1 = 2z \cos 3^\circ,$ or $z^2 - 2z \cos 3^\circ + 1 = 0.$  Then by the quadratic formula,
\[z = \frac{2 \cos 3^\circ \pm \sqrt{4 \cos^2 3^\circ - 4}}{2} = \cos 3^\circ \pm i \sin 3^\circ.\]Then by DeMoivre's Theorem,
\[z^{2000} = \cos 6000^\circ \pm i \sin 6000^\circ = \cos 240^\circ \pm i \sin 240^\circ,\]and
\[\frac{1}{z^{2000}} = \cos (-240^\circ) \pm i \sin (-240^\circ) = \cos 240^\circ \mp i \sin 240^\circ,\]so
\[z^{2000} + \frac{1}{z^{2000}} = 2 \cos 240^\circ = \boxed{-1}.\]
We have that $\rho = 4,$ $\theta = \frac{5 \pi}{3},$ and $\phi = \frac{\pi}{2},$ so
\begin{align*}
x &= \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta = 4 \sin \frac{\pi}{2} \cos \frac{5 \pi}{3} = 2, \\
y &= \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta = 4 \sin \frac{\pi}{2} \sin \frac{5 \pi}{3} = -2 \sqrt{3}, \\
z &= \rho \cos \phi = 4 \cos \frac{\pi}{2} = 0.
\end{align*}Therefore, the rectangular coordinates are $\boxed{(2, -2 \sqrt{3}, 0)}.$
The projection of $\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ b \end{pmatrix}$ onto $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is given by
\[\frac{\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right\|^2} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{b - 16}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.\]So, we want $\frac{b - 16}{5} = \frac{-13}{5}.$  Solving, we find $b = \boxed{3}.$
From $r = 4 \tan \theta \sec \theta,$
\[r = 4 \cdot \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \cdot \frac{1}{\cos \theta}.\]Then $r \cos^2 \theta = 4 \sin \theta,$ so
\[r^2 \cos^2 \theta = 4r \sin \theta.\]Hence, $x^2 = 4y.$  This is the equation of a parabola, so the answer is $\boxed{\text{(C)}}.$

The side length of equilateral triangle $ABC$ is 3.
Let $x = BP.$  Then $AP = A'P = 3 - x,$ so by the Law of Cosines on triangle $PBA',$
\[(3 - x)^2 = x^2 + 3^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot 3 \cdot \cos 60^\circ = x^2 - 3x + 9.\]Solving, we find $x = \frac{8}{5}.$
Let $y = CQ.$  Then $AQ = A'Q = 3 - y,$ so by the Law of Cosines on triangle $QCA',$
\[(3 - y)^2 = y^2 + 2^2 - 2 \cdot y \cdot 2 \cdot \cos 60^\circ = y^2 - 2y + 4.\]Solving, we find $y = \frac{5}{4}.$
Then $AP = \frac{7}{5}$ and $AQ = \frac{7}{4},$ so by the Law of Cosines on triangle $APQ,$
\[PQ^2 = \sqrt{\left( \frac{7}{5} \right)^2  - \frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{7}{4} + \left( \frac{7}{4} \right)^2} = \boxed{\frac{7 \sqrt{21}}{20}}.\]
The inverse of $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}$ is
\[\frac{1}{(1)(-2) - (-4)(3)} \begin{pmatrix} -2 & 4 \\ -3 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{10} \begin{pmatrix} -2 & 4 \\ -3 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.\]So, multiplying by this inverse on the right, we get
\[\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} -16 & -6 \\ 7 & 2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{10} \begin{pmatrix} -2 & 4 \\ -3 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 5 & -7 \\ -2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We can assume that the side length of the square is 2
Then by Pythagoras, $AM = AN = \sqrt{5},$ and $MN = \sqrt{2},$ so by the Law of Cosines on triangle $AMN,$
\[\cos \theta = \frac{AM^2 + AN^2 - MN^2}{2 \cdot AM \cdot AN} = \frac{5 + 5 - 2}{10} = \frac{8}{10} = \frac{4}{5}.\]Then
\[\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta = \frac{9}{25}.\]Since $\theta$ is acute, $\sin \theta = \boxed{\frac{3}{5}}.$
Note that
\[\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & \frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos 300^\circ & -\sin 300^\circ \\ \sin 300^\circ & \cos 300^\circ \end{pmatrix},\]which is the matrix corresponding to rotating about the origin by an angle of $300^\circ$ counter-clockwise
Thus, we seek the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $300^\circ \cdot n$ is a multiple of $360^\circ.$  The smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{6}.$
Let the circumcenter $O$ of triangle $ABC$ be the origin, so $\|\overrightarrow{P}\| = R.$  Also, $\overrightarrow{H} = \overrightarrow{A} + \overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
PA^2 &= \|\overrightarrow{P} - \overrightarrow{A}\|^2 \\
&= (\overrightarrow{P} - \overrightarrow{A}) \cdot (\overrightarrow{P} - \overrightarrow{A}) \\
&= \overrightarrow{P} \cdot \overrightarrow{P} - 2 \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{P} + \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{A} \\
&= R^2 - 2 \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{P} + R^2 \\
&= 2R^2 - 2 \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{P}.
\end{align*}Similarly,
\begin{align*}
PB^2 &= 2R^2 - 2 \overrightarrow{B} \cdot \overrightarrow{P}, \\
PC^2 &= 2R^2 - 2 \overrightarrow{C} \cdot \overrightarrow{P},
\end{align*}and
\begin{align*}PH^2 &= \|\overrightarrow{P} - \overrightarrow{H}\|^2 \\
&= \|\overrightarrow{P} - \overrightarrow{A} - \overrightarrow{B} - \overrightarrow{C}\|^2 \\
&= \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{A} + \overrightarrow{B} \cdot \overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C} \cdot \overrightarrow{C} + \overrightarrow{P} \cdot \overrightarrow{P} \\
&\quad + 2 \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{B} + 2 \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{C} + 2 \overrightarrow{B} \cdot \overrightarrow{C} - 2 \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{P} - 2 \overrightarrow{B} \cdot \overrightarrow{P} - 2 \overrightarrow{C} \cdot \overrightarrow{P} \\
&= R^2 + R^2 + R^2 + R^2 \\
&\quad + 2 \left( R^2 - \frac{a^2}{2} \right) + 2 \left( R^2 - \frac{b^2}{2} \right) + 2 \left( R^2 - \frac{c^2}{2} \right) - 2 \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{P} - 2 \overrightarrow{B} \cdot \overrightarrow{P} - 2 \overrightarrow{C} \cdot \overrightarrow{P} \\
&= 10R^2 - a^2 - b^2 - c^2 - 2 \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{P} - 2 \overrightarrow{B} \cdot \overrightarrow{P} - 2 \overrightarrow{C} \cdot \overrightarrow{P}.
\end{align*}Thus,
\[PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 - PH^2 = \boxed{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 4R^2}.\]
Let $x = 2^t - 3.$  Then $2^t = x + 3,$ and
\begin{align*}
y &= 4^t - 5 \cdot 2^t - 1 \\
&= (2^t)^2 - 5 \cdot 2^t - 1 \\
&= (x + 3)^2 - 5(x + 3) - 1 \\
&= x^2 + x - 7.
\end{align*}Thus, all the plotted points lie on a parabola
The answer is $\boxed{\text{(C)}}.$
Given cylindrical coordinates $(r,\theta,z),$ the rectangular coordinates are given by
\[(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta, z).\]So here, the rectangular coordinates are
\[\left( 5 \cos \frac{3 \pi}{2}, 5 \sin \frac{3 \pi}{2}, 4 \right) = \boxed{(0, -5, 4)}.\]
Let $a = \cos 36^\circ$ and $b = \cos 72^\circ.$  Then
\[b = \cos 72^\circ = 2 \cos^2 36^\circ - 1 = 2a^2 - 1.\]Also,
\[a = \cos 36^\circ = 1 - 2 \sin^2 18^\circ = 1 - 2 \cos^2 72^\circ = 1 - 2b^2.\]Adding these equations, we get
\[a + b = 2a^2 - 2b^2 = 2(a + b)(a - b).\]Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $a + b \neq 0.$  We can then divide both sides by $2(a + b),$ to get
\[a - b = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.\]
A point on the line is given by
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 6 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2t \\ 6t \\ 1 - 3t \end{pmatrix}.\][asy]
unitsize (0.6 cm);
pair A, B, C, D, E, F, H;
A = (2,5);
B = (0,0);
C = (8,0);
D = (A + reflect(B,C)*(A))/2;
draw(A--D);
draw((0,0)--(8,0));
dot("$(2,3,4)$", A, N);
dot("$(4 - 2t, 6t, 1 - 3t)$", D, S);
[/asy]
The vector pointing from $(2,3,4)$ to $(4 - 2t, 6t, 1 - 3t)$ is then
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 - 2t \\ -3 + 6t \\ -3 - 3t \end{pmatrix}.\]For the point on the line that is closest to $(2,3,4),$ this vector will be orthogonal to the direction vector of the second line, which is $\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 6 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.$  Thus,
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 - 2t \\ -3 + 6t \\ -3 - 3t \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 6 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = 0.\]This gives us $(2 - 2t)(-2) + (-3 + 6t)(6) + (-3 - 3t)(-3) = 0.$  Solving, we find $t = \frac{13}{49}.$
For this value of $t,$ the point is $\boxed{\left( \frac{170}{49}, \frac{78}{49}, \frac{10}{49} \right)}.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
\frac{\cot \gamma}{\cot \alpha + \cot \beta} &= \frac{\frac{\cos \gamma}{\sin \gamma}}{\frac{\cos \alpha}{\sin \alpha} + \frac{\cos \beta}{\sin \beta}} \\
&= \frac{\sin \alpha \sin \beta \cos \gamma}{\sin \gamma (\cos \alpha \sin \beta + \sin \alpha \cos \beta)}
&= \frac{\sin \alpha \sin \beta \cos \gamma}{\sin \gamma \sin (\alpha + \beta)} \\
&= \frac{\sin \alpha \sin \beta \cos \gamma}{\sin^2 \gamma}.
\end{align*}By the Law of Sines,
\[\frac{a}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{b}{\sin \beta} = \frac{c}{\sin \gamma},\]so
\[\frac{\sin \alpha \sin \beta \cos \gamma}{\sin^2 \gamma} = \frac{ab \cos \gamma}{c^2}.\]By the Law of Cosines,
\[\frac{ab \cos \gamma}{c^2} = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2c^2} = \frac{1989c^2 - c^2}{2c^2} = \boxed{994}.\]
The line through $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{c}$ can be parameterized by
\[\begin{pmatrix} 7 - 9t \\ -4 + 3t \\ -4 + 6t \end{pmatrix}.\]Then $\mathbf{b}$ is of this form
Furthermore, the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is equal to the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{c}.$  Hence,
\[\frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}}{\|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{c}\|}.\]We can cancel the factors of $\|\mathbf{b}\|,$ to get
\[\frac{\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ -4 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 7 - 9t \\ -4 + 3t \\ -4 + 6t \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ -4 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 7 - 9t \\ -4 + 3t \\ -4 + 6t \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \right\|}.\]Then
\[\frac{(7)(7 - 9t) + (-4)(-4 + 3t) + (-4)(-4 + 6t)}{9} = \frac{(7 - 9t)(-2) + (-4 + 3t)(-1) + (-4 + 6t)(2)}{3}\]Solving, we find $t = \frac{3}{4}.$  Therefore, $\mathbf{b} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 1/4 \\ -7/4 \\ 1/2 \end{pmatrix}}.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
\csc \frac{\pi}{14} - 4 \cos \frac{2 \pi}{7} &= \frac{1}{\sin \frac{\pi}{14}} - 4 \cos \frac{2 \pi}{7} \\
&= \frac{2 \cos \frac{\pi}{14}}{2 \cos \frac{\pi}{14} \sin \frac{\pi}{14}} - 4 \cos \frac{2 \pi}{7}.
\end{align*}By double-angle formula,
\begin{align*}
\frac{2 \cos \frac{\pi}{14}}{2 \cos \frac{\pi}{14} \sin \frac{\pi}{14}} - 4 \cos \frac{2 \pi}{7} &= \frac{2 \cos \frac{\pi}{14}}{\sin \frac{\pi}{7}} - 4 \cos \frac{2 \pi}{7} \\
&= \frac{4 \cos \frac{\pi}{7} \cos \frac{\pi}{14}}{2 \cos \frac{\pi}{7} \sin \frac{\pi}{7}} - 4 \cos \frac{2 \pi}{7} \\
&= \frac{4 \cos \frac{\pi}{7} \cos \frac{\pi}{14}}{\sin \frac{2 \pi}{7}} - 4 \cos \frac{2 \pi}{7} \\
&= \frac{4 \cos \frac{\pi}{7} \cos \frac{\pi}{14} - 4 \sin \frac{2 \pi}{7} \cos \frac{2 \pi}{7}}{\sin \frac{2 \pi}{7}}.
\end{align*}Then by product-to-sum and double angle formula,
\begin{align*}
\frac{4 \cos \frac{\pi}{7} \cos \frac{\pi}{14} - 4 \sin \frac{2 \pi}{7} \cos \frac{2 \pi}{7}}{\sin \frac{2 \pi}{7}} &= \frac{2 (\cos \frac{3 \pi}{14} + \cos \frac{\pi}{14}) - 2 \sin \frac{4 \pi}{7}}{\sin \frac{2 \pi}{7}} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin \frac{2 \pi}{7} + 2 \sin \frac{3 \pi}{7} - 2 \sin \frac{4 \pi}{7}}{\sin \frac{2 \pi}{7}} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin \frac{2 \pi}{7}}{\sin \frac{2 \pi}{7}} \\
&= \boxed{2}.
\end{align*}
In general,
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ a & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ b & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ a + b & 1 \end{pmatrix},\]so
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}^{2018} = \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \dotsm \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}}_{\text{2018 matrices}} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 2018 & 1 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Converting to degrees,
\[\frac{11 \pi}{3} = \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \cdot \frac{11 \pi}{3} = 660^\circ.\]The sine function has period $360^\circ,$ $\sin 660^\circ = \sin (660^\circ - 2 \cdot 360^\circ) = \sin (-60^\circ) = -\sin 60^\circ = \boxed{-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}.$
From the projection formula, the projection of $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$ onto $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}$ is
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{proj}_{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} &= \frac{\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{2x - 3y}{13} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4x - 6y}{13} \\ \frac{-6x + 9y}{13} \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}To find the matrix for the projection, we write this vector as the product of a matrix and the vector $\begin{pmatrix} x \\y \end{pmatrix}$:
\[\begin{pmatrix} \frac{4x - 6y}{13} \\ \frac{-6x + 9y}{13} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4/13 & -6/13 \\ -6/13 & 9/13 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\y \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, the matrix for this transformation is $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 4/13 & -6/13 \\ -6/13 & 9/13 \end{pmatrix}}.$
Let $\mathbf{u} = \overrightarrow{AE},$ $\mathbf{v} = \overrightarrow{AB},$ and $\mathbf{w} = \overrightarrow{AD}.$  Also, assume that $A$ is a at the origin

\overrightarrow{F} &= \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}, \\
\overrightarrow{G} &= \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}, \\

\end{align*}Similarly,
\begin{align*}

CE^2 &= \|-\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}\|^2 = \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{w} - 2 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} - 2 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w} + 2 \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}, \\
DF^2 &= \|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{w}\|^2 = \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{w} + 2 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} - 2 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w} - 2 \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w},
\end{align*}so
\[AG^2 + BH^2 + CE^2 + DF^2 = 4 (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{w}).\]Also, $AB^2 + AD^2 + AE^2 = \|\mathbf{u}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{w}\|^2 = \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{w},$ so
\[\frac{AG^2 + BH^2 + CE^2 + DF^2}{AB^2 + AD^2 + AE^2} = \boxed{4}.\]
From the given equation,
\[\cos 2x \cos 3x - \sin 2x \sin 3x = 0.\]Then from the angle addition formula, $\cos (2x + 3x) = 0,$ or $\cos 5x = 0.$  To find the smallest positive solution, we take $5x = 90^\circ,$ so $x = \boxed{18^\circ}.$
The center of the sphere must have the same $x$- and $y$-coordinates of $(2,4,0).$  It must also have the same $y$- and $z$-coordinates as $(0,4,-7).$  Therefore, the center of the sphere is $(2,4,-7).$

Let $P$ be a point on the circle centered at $(2,4,0)$ with radius 1
Then $P,$ $(2,4,0),$ and $(2,4,-7)$ form a right triangle, which tells us that the radius of the sphere is $\sqrt{1^2 + 7^2} = 5 \sqrt{2}.$
Let $Q$ be a point on the circle centered at $(0,4,-7)$ with radius $r.$  Then $Q,$ $(0,4,-7),$ and $(2,4,-7)$ form a right triangle, which tells us that the $r = \sqrt{50 - 2^2} = \boxed{\sqrt{46}}.$
By the scalar triple product,
\[\mathbf{p} \cdot (\mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{n}) = \mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{m}) = \frac{1}{4}.\]Then
\[\|\mathbf{p}\| \|\mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{n}\| \cos \alpha = \frac{1}{4}.\]Also, $\|\mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{n}\| = \|\mathbf{m}\| \|\mathbf{n}\| \sin \alpha,$ so
\[\|\mathbf{p}\| \|\mathbf{m}\| \|\mathbf{n}\| \sin \alpha \cos \alpha = \frac{1}{4}.\]Since $\mathbf{m},$ $\mathbf{n},$ and $\mathbf{p}$ are unit vectors,
\[\sin \alpha \cos \alpha = \frac{1}{4}.\]Then $2 \sin \alpha \cos \alpha = \frac{1}{2},$ so
\[\sin 2 \alpha = \frac{1}{2}.\]The smallest possible angle that satisfies this is $\alpha = \boxed{30^\circ}.$
First, note that since $\mathbf{a}$ is orthogonal to both $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{c},$ $\mathbf{a}$ is a scalar multiple of their cross product $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}.$  Furthermore,
\[\|\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\| = \|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{c}\| \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.\]Hence,
\[\|\mathbf{a}\| = \| k (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) \| = \frac{|k|}{\sqrt{2}}.\]But $\mathbf{a}$ is a unit vector, so the possible values of $k$ are $\boxed{\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}}.$
The direction vector of the first line is $\begin{pmatrix} a \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  The direction vector of the second line is $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3/2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.$
The lines are orthogonal when the direction vectors will be orthogonal, which means their dot product will be 0
This gives us
\[(a)(1) + (-2) \left( \frac{3}{2} \right) + (1)(2) = 0.\]Solving, we find $a = \boxed{1}.$
From $\begin{vmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{vmatrix} = 5,$ $ad - bc = 5.$  Then
\[\begin{vmatrix} 2a & 2b \\ 2c & 2d \end{vmatrix} = (2a)(2d) - (2b)(2c) = 4(ad - bc) = \boxed{20}.\]
Solving for $t$ in $x = 2t + 4,$ we find
\[t = \frac{x - 4}{2}.\]Then
\[y = 4t - 5 = 4 \cdot \frac{x - 4}{2} - 5 = 2x - 13.\]Thus, the equation is $\boxed{y = 2x - 13}.$
We have that $\rho = \sqrt{(2 \sqrt{3})^2 + 6^2 + (-4)^2} = 8.$  We want $\phi$ to satisfy
\[-4 = 8 \cos \phi,\]so $\phi = \frac{2 \pi}{3}.$
We want $\theta$ to satisfy
\begin{align*}
2 \sqrt{3} &= 8 \sin \frac{2 \pi}{3} \cos \theta, \\
6 &= 8 \sin \frac{2 \pi}{3} \sin \theta.
\end{align*}Thus, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3},$ so the spherical coordinates are $\boxed{\left( 8, \frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{2 \pi}{3} \right)}.$
We can write
\[\tan \frac{\pi}{24} + \tan \frac{7 \pi}{24} = \frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{24}}{\cos \frac{\pi}{24}} + \frac{\sin \frac{7 \pi}{24}}{\cos \frac{7 \pi}{24}}
= \frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{24} \cos \frac{7 \pi}{24} + \cos \frac{\pi}{24} \sin \frac{7 \pi}{24}}{\cos \frac{\pi}{24} \cos \frac{7 \pi}{24}}.\]By the angle addition formula and the product-to-sum formula,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{24} \cos \frac{7 \pi}{24} + \cos \frac{\pi}{24} \sin \frac{7 \pi}{24}}{\cos \frac{\pi}{24} \cos \frac{7 \pi}{24}} &= \frac{\sin (\frac{\pi}{24} + \frac{7 \pi}{24})}{\frac{1}{2} (\cos \frac{\pi}{3} + \cos \frac{\pi}{4})} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin \frac{\pi}{3}}{\cos \frac{\pi}{3} + \cos \frac{\pi}{4}} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} \\
&= \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{1 + \sqrt{2}} \\
&= \frac{2 \sqrt{3} (\sqrt{2} - 1)}{(\sqrt{2} + 1)(\sqrt{2} - 1)} \\
&= \boxed{2 \sqrt{6} - 2 \sqrt{3}}.
\end{align*}
Expanding, we get
\begin{align*}
&\|\mathbf{a} - 2 \mathbf{b}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b} - 2 \mathbf{c}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a}\|^2 \\
&= (\mathbf{a} - 2 \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} - 2 \mathbf{b}) + (\mathbf{b} - 2 \mathbf{c}) \cdot (\mathbf{b} - 2 \mathbf{c}) + (\mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a}) \cdot (\mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a}) \\
&= \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - 4 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 4 \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 - 4 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + 4 \|\mathbf{c}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{c}\|^2 - 4 \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 4 \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 \\
&= 5 \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + 5 \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 + 5 \|\mathbf{c}\|^2 - 4 (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \\
&= 5 \cdot 1 + 5 \cdot 1 + 5 \cdot 4 - 4 (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \\
&= 30 - 4 (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}).
\end{align*}Now, $\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}\| \ge 0,$ so
\[\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}\|^2 \ge 0.\]We can expand this as
\[\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{c}\|^2 + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} \ge 0.\]Then $2 (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \ge -1 - 1 - 4 = -6,$ so
\[\|\mathbf{a} - 2 \mathbf{b}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b} - 2 \mathbf{c}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a}\|^2 = 30 - 4 (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \le 42.\]Equality occurs when $\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{c} = -2 \mathbf{a}$ (which makes $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$), so the largest possible value is $\boxed{42}.$
We have that
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} - 4 \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 - 4(-1) \\ -5 - 4(7) \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -33 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We have that
\begin{align*}
\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\|^2 &= (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \\
&= \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} \\
&= \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2.
\end{align*}Hence, $11^2 = 6^2 + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 8^2,$ so
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \frac{21}{2}.\]Then
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{21/2}{6 \cdot 8} = \boxed{\frac{7}{32}}.\]
Let $\alpha=\angle CBO=\angle ABC$
By the Law of Sines on triangle $BCO,$
\[\frac{BC}{\sin\theta} = \frac{OC}{\sin\alpha},\]so $OC=\frac{BC\sin\alpha}{\sin\theta}$.
In right triangle $ABC$,
\[\sin\alpha = \frac{AC}{BC} = \frac{1-OC}{BC}.\]Hence, $OC=\frac{1-OC}{\sin\theta}$
Solving this for $OC$ yields $OC= \frac{1}{1+\sin\theta} = \boxed{\frac{1}{1 + s}}.$
From the given information,
\[\overrightarrow{E} = \frac{1}{3} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{2}{3} \overrightarrow{C}\]and
\[\overrightarrow{F} = \frac{4}{5} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{1}{5} \overrightarrow{B}.\]Isolating $\overrightarrow{A}$ in each equation, we obtain
\[\overrightarrow{A} = 3 \overrightarrow{E} - 2 \overrightarrow{C} = \frac{5 \overrightarrow{F} - \overrightarrow{B}}{4}.\]Then $12 \overrightarrow{E} - 8 \overrightarrow{C} = 5 \overrightarrow{F} - \overrightarrow{B},$ so $12 \overrightarrow{E} + \overrightarrow{B} = 5 \overrightarrow{F} + 8 \overrightarrow{C},$ or
\[\frac{12}{13} \overrightarrow{E} + \frac{1}{13} \overrightarrow{B} = \frac{5}{13} \overrightarrow{F} + \frac{8}{13} \overrightarrow{C}.\]Since the coefficients on both sides of the equation add up to 1, the vector on the left side lies on line $BE,$ and the vector on the right side lies on line $CF.$  Therefore, this common vector is $\overrightarrow{P}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow{P} &= \frac{12}{13} \overrightarrow{E} + \frac{1}{13} \overrightarrow{B} \\
&= \frac{12}{13} \left( \frac{1}{3} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{2}{3} \overrightarrow{C} \right) + \frac{1}{13} \overrightarrow{B} \\
&= \frac{4}{13} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{1}{13} \overrightarrow{B} + \frac{8}{13} \overrightarrow{C}.
\end{align*}Thus, $(x,y,z) = \boxed{\left( \frac{4}{13}, \frac{1}{13}, \frac{8}{13} \right)}.$
Since the polynomial $P(x)$ has real coefficients, if $z$ is a nonreal root of $P(x),$ then so is its conjugate $\overline{z}.$  Thus, the other two roots of $P(x)$ are $\cos \theta - i \sin \theta$ and $\sin \theta - i \cos \theta.$  When we plot the four roots (all of which lie on the unit circle), we obtain a trapezoid.
unitsize(2 cm);
pair A, B, C, D;
A = dir(30);
B = dir(60);
C = dir(-60);
D = dir(-30);
filldraw(A--B--C--D--cycle,gray(0.7));
draw(Circle((0,0),1));
draw((-1.2,0)--(1.2,0));
draw((0,-1.2)--(0,1.2));
dot("$\cos \theta + i \sin \theta$", A, A);
dot("$\sin \theta + i \cos \theta$", B, B);
dot("$\sin \theta - i \cos \theta$", C, C);
dot("$\cos \theta - i \sin \theta$", D, D);
[/asy]
The area of this trapezoid is
\begin{align*}
\frac{2 \cos \theta + 2 \sin \theta}{2} \cdot (\cos \theta - \sin \theta) &= (\cos \theta + \sin \theta)(\cos \theta - \sin \theta) \\
&= \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta \\
&= \cos 2 \theta.
\end{align*}The monic quartic $P(x)$ is
\begin{align*}
&(x - (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta))(x - (\cos \theta - i \sin \theta))(x - (\sin \theta + i \cos \theta))(x - (\sin \theta - i \cos \theta)) \\
&= (x^2 - 2x \cos \theta + 1)(x^2 - 2x \sin \theta + 1).
\end{align*}Then $P(0) = 1,$ so the area of the quadrilateral is $\frac{1}{2}.$  Hence,
\[\cos 2 \theta = \frac{1}{2}.\]Since $0 < 2 \theta < \frac{\pi}{2},$ we must have $2 \theta = \frac{\pi}{3},$ or $\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}.$
The sum of the four roots is then $2 \cos \theta + 2 \sin \theta = \boxed{1 + \sqrt{3}}.$
Place the cube in coordinate space so that $P_1 = (0,0,0)$ and $P_1' = (1,1,1),$ and the edges of the cube are parallel to the axes
Since all the side lengths of the octahedron are equal, the vertices on $\overline{P_1 P_2},$ $\overline{P_1 P_3},$ and $\overline{P_1 P_4}$ must be equidistant from $P_1.$  Let this distance be $x,$ so one vertex is at $(x,0,0).$  Also, this makes the side length of the octahedron $x \sqrt{2}.$
Similarly, the other three vertices have a distance of $x$ from $P_1',$ so one of them is at $(1,1 - x,1).$

[/asy]
Hence,
\[(1 - x)^2 + (1 - x)^2 + 1 = 2x^2.\]Solving, we find $x = \frac{3}{4}.$  Therefore, the side length of the octahedron is $\boxed{\frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{4}}.$
We have that $r = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + (-\sqrt{2})^2} = 2.$  Also, if we draw the line connecting the origin and $(\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}),$ this line makes an angle of $\frac{7 \pi}{4}$ with the positive $x$-axis.

Therefore, the polar coordinates are $\boxed{\left( 2, \frac{7 \pi}{4} \right)}.$
Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}.$  Then the projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ is given by
\begin{align*}
\frac{\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} &= \frac{2x - 2y - z}{9} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4}{9} x - \frac{4}{9} y - \frac{2}{9} z \\ -\frac{4}{9} x + \frac{4}{9} y + \frac{2}{9} z \\ -\frac{2}{9} x + \frac{2}{9} y + \frac{1}{9} z \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1} \\
&= \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4}{9} & -\frac{4}{9} & -\frac{2}{9} \\ -\frac{4}{9} & \frac{4}{9} & \frac{2}{9} \\ -\frac{2}{9} & \frac{2}{9} & \frac{1}{9} \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}Thus,
\[\mathbf{P} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \frac{4}{9} & -\frac{4}{9} & -\frac{2}{9} \\ -\frac{4}{9} & \frac{4}{9} & \frac{2}{9} \\ -\frac{2}{9} & \frac{2}{9} & \frac{1}{9} \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We have that $\rho = 12,$ $\theta = \pi,$ and $\phi = \frac{\pi}{4},$ so
\begin{align*}
x &= \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\pi}{4} \cos \pi = -\sqrt{2}, \\
y &= \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\pi}{4} \sin \pi = 0, \\
z &= \rho \cos \phi = 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \sqrt{2}.
\end{align*}Therefore, the rectangular coordinates are $\boxed{(-\sqrt{2}, 0, \sqrt{2})}.$
Converting to degrees,
\[\frac{5 \pi}{4} = \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \cdot \frac{5 \pi}{4} = 225^\circ.\]Then $\cos 225^\circ = -\cos (225^\circ - 180^\circ) = -\cos 45^\circ = \boxed{-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}.$
From the angle addition formula,
\begin{align*}
\tan 75^\circ &= \tan (45^\circ + 30^\circ) \\
&= \frac{\tan 45^\circ + \tan 30^\circ}{1 - \tan 45^\circ \tan 30^\circ} \\
&= \frac{1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}{1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \\
&= \frac{(\sqrt{3} + 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} \\
&= \frac{3 + 2 \sqrt{3} + 1}{2} \\
&= \boxed{2 + \sqrt{3}}.
\end{align*}
We have that $\angle P = 180^\circ - 30^\circ - 105^\circ = 45^\circ.$  Then by the Law of Sines,
\[\frac{QR}{\sin P} = \frac{PR}{\sin Q}.\]Hence,
\[QR = PR \cdot \frac{\sin P}{\sin Q} = 4 \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sin 45^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ} = \boxed{8}.\]
Given cylindrical coordinates $(r,\theta,z),$ the rectangular coordinates are given by
\[(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta, z).\]So here, the rectangular coordinates are
\[\left( 8 \cos \frac{\pi}{4}, 8 \sin \frac{\pi}{4}, \sqrt{3} \right) = \boxed{(4 \sqrt{2}, 4 \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})}.\]
Let $B'$ be the point at $0^\circ$ latitude and $115^\circ$ W longitude
We see that $\angle ACB = 360^\circ - 110^\circ - 115^\circ = 135^\circ.$

Assume that the radius of the Earth is 1
Since $\angle BCP = 45^\circ,$ $CP = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.$
Since $\angle ACB' = 135^\circ,$ $\angle PCQ = 45^\circ,$ so
\[CQ = \frac{CP}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2}.\]Since plane $BPQ$ is perpendicular to $\overline{AD},$ $\angle BQC = 90^\circ.$  And since $CB = 2 \cdot CQ,$ triangle $BCQ$ is a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle
In particular, $\angle BCQ = 60^\circ,$ so $\angle ACB = \boxed{120^\circ}.$
Note that the $z$-coordinate of both $(1,a,b)$ and $(a,2,b)$ is $b,$ so the whole line must lie in the plane $z = b.$  Hence, $b = 3.$
Similarly, the $x$-coordinate of both $(a,2,b)$ and $(a,b,3)$ is $a,$ so the whole line must lie in the plane $x = a.$  Hence, $a = 1,$ so $a + b = \boxed{4}.$
We know that the roots of $x^{10}+x^9 + \cdots + x + 1$ are the eleventh roots of unity except $1.$ These are $e^{2 k \pi i / 11},$ $k = 1,$ $2,$ $\ldots,$ $10,$ which are just $\omega,$ $\omega^2,$ $\ldots,$ $\omega^{10}.$ Therefore, we must have
$$(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2)\cdots(x-\omega^{10}) = x^{10} + x^9 + \cdots + x + 1.$$Therefore,
(2-w)(2-w^2)\cdots(2-w^{10}) = 2^{10} + 2^9 + \cdots + 2 + 1 = \boxed{2047}.
From the addition formula for tangent,
\[\tan f(x) = \tan \left( \arctan x + \arctan \frac{1 - x}{1 + x} \right) = \frac{x + \frac{1 - x}{1 + x}}{1 - x \cdot \frac{1 - x}{1 + x}} = 1.\]If $x < -1,$ then $-\frac{\pi}{2} < \arctan x < -\frac{\pi}{4}.$  Also,
\[1 + \frac{1 - x}{1 + x} = \frac{2}{1 + x} < 0,\]so $\frac{1 - x}{1 + x} < -1,$ which means $-\frac{\pi}{2} < \arctan \frac{1 - x}{1 + x} < -\frac{\pi}{4}.$  Therefore, $-\pi < f(x) < -\frac{\pi}{2}.$  Since $\tan f(x) = 1,$ $f(x) = -\frac{3 \pi}{4}.$
If $x > -1,$ then $-\frac{\pi}{4} < \arctan x < \frac{\pi}{2}.$  Also,
\[1 + \frac{1 - x}{1 + x} = \frac{2}{1 + x} > 0,\]so $\frac{1 - x}{1 + x} > -1,$ which means $-\frac{\pi}{4} < \arctan \frac{1 - x}{1 + x} < \frac{\pi}{2}.$  Therefore, $-\frac{\pi}{2} < f(x) < \pi.$  Since $\tan f(x) = 1,$ $f(x) = \frac{\pi}{4}.$
Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ consists of the numbers $\boxed{-\frac{3 \pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{4}}.$
Let $x = \frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2}$ and $y = \frac{2t}{1 + t^2}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
x^2 + y^2 &= \left( \frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{2t}{1 + t^2} \right)^2 \\
&= \frac{1 - 2t^2 + t^4}{1 + 2t^2 + t^4} + \frac{4t^2}{1 + 2t^2 + t^4} \\
&= \frac{1 + 2t^2 + t^4}{1 + 2t^2 + t^4} \\
\end{align*}Thus, all the plotted points lie on a circle
The answer is $\boxed{\text{(B)}}.$
Let $\omega = e^{\pi i/6}.$  Then assuming the bee starts at the origin, $P_{2015}$ is at the point
\[z = 1 + 2 \omega + 3 \omega^2 + 4 \omega^3 + \dots + 2015 \omega^{2014}.\]Then
\[\omega z = \omega + 2 \omega^2 + 3 \omega^3 + 4 \omega^4 + \dots + 2015 \omega^{2015}.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\begin{align*}
(\omega - 1) z &= 2015 \omega^{2015} - \omega^{2014} - \omega^{2013} - \dots - \omega - 1 \\
&= 2015 \omega^{2015} - \frac{\omega^{2015} - 1}{\omega - 1}.
\end{align*}Since $\omega^6 = 1, \ $ $\omega^{2015} = (\omega^6)^{335} \cdot \omega^5 = \omega^5.$  Hence,
\begin{align*}
(\omega - 1) z &= 2015 \omega^5 - \frac{\omega^5 - 1}{\omega - 1} \\
&= 2015 \omega^5 - \omega^4 - \omega^3 - \omega^2 - \omega - 1.
\end{align*}And since $\omega^3 = -1,$ this reduces to
\begin{align*}
(\omega - 1) z &= -2015 \omega^2 + \omega + 1 - \omega^2 - \omega - 1 \\
&= -2015 \omega^2 - \omega^2 = -2016 \omega^2,
\end{align*}so
\[z = -\frac{2016 \omega^2}{\omega - 1}.\]Hence,
\[|z| = \left|  -\frac{2016 \omega^2}{\omega - 1} \right| = \frac{2016}{|\omega - 1|}.\]If we plot 0, 1, and $\omega$ in the complex plane, we obtain an isosceles triangle.

Thus, the distance between 1 and $\omega$ is $|\omega - 1| = 2 \sin \frac{\pi}{12} = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{2},$ so
\[|z| = \frac{2016}{\frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{2}} =\frac{4032}{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{4032 (\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}{4} = \boxed{1008 \sqrt{6} + 1008 \sqrt{2}}.\]
We can factor $\cos^6 \theta + \sin^6 \theta$ to get
\begin{align*}
\cos^6 \theta + \sin^6 \theta &= (\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta)(\cos^4 \theta - \cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \theta + \sin^4 \theta) \\
&= \cos^4 \theta - \cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \theta + \sin^4 \theta.
\end{align*}Squaring the equation $\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1,$ we get
\[\cos^4 \theta + 2 \cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \theta + \sin^4 \theta = 1.\]Hence,
\[\cos^4 \theta - \cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \theta + \sin^4 \theta = 1 - 3 \cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \theta.\]From $\sin 2 \theta = \frac{1}{3},$
\[2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \frac{1}{3},\]so $\cos \theta \sin \theta = \frac{1}{6}.$  Therefore,
\[1 - 3 \cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \theta = 1 - 3 \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^2 = \boxed{\frac{11}{12}}.\]
Since the set $\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ k \end{pmatrix} \right\}$ is linearly dependent, there exist non-zero constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that
\[c_1 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} + c_2 \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ k \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.\]Then $c_1 + 3c_2 = 0$ and $2c_1 + kc_2 = 0.$  From the first equation, $c_1 = -3c_2.$  Then
\[-6c_2 + kc_2 = 0,\]or $(k - 6) c_2 = 0.$  Since $c_2 \neq 0,$ $k - 6 = 0,$ so $k = \boxed{6}.$
Taking $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{i},$ we get that the first column of $\mathbf{M}$ is
\[\mathbf{M} \mathbf{i} = -4 \mathbf{i} = \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.\]Similarly, the second column of $\mathbf{M}$ is $-4 \mathbf{j},$ and the third column of $\mathbf{M}$ is $-4 \mathbf{k}.$  Therefore,
\[\mathbf{M} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -4 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -4 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -4 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
From the equation $z^{28} - z^8 - 1 = 0,$ $z^{28} - z^8 = 1,$ or
\[z^8 (z^{20} - 1) = 1.\]Then $|z^8| |z^{20} - 1| = 1.$  Since $|z| = 1,$ $|z^{20} - 1| = 1.$  So if $w = z^{20},$ then $w$ lies on the circle centered at 1 with radius 1
But $|w| = |z^{20}| = |z|^{20} = 1,$ so $w$ also lies on the circle centered at the origin with radius 1
These circles intersect at $\operatorname{cis} 60^\circ$ and $\operatorname{cis} 300^\circ,$ so $w = z^{20}$ must be one of these values.

If $z^{20} = \operatorname{cis} 60^\circ,$ then $z^{20} - 1 = \operatorname{cis} 120^\circ,$ so $z^8 = \operatorname{cis} 240^\circ.$  Then
\[z^4 = \frac{z^{20}}{(z^8)^2} = \operatorname{cis} 300^\circ.\]Conversely, if $z^4 = \operatorname{cis} 300^\circ,$ then
\begin{align*}
z^8 (z^{20} - 1) &= \operatorname{cis} 600^\circ (\operatorname{cis} 1500^\circ - 1) \\
&= \operatorname{cis} 240^\circ (\operatorname{cis} 60^\circ - 1) \\
&= \operatorname{cis} 240^\circ \operatorname{cis} 120^\circ \\
\end{align*}The solutions to $z^4 = \operatorname{cis} 300^\circ$ are $\operatorname{cis} 75^\circ,$ $\operatorname{cis} 165^\circ,$ $\operatorname{cis} 255^\circ,$ and $\operatorname{cis} 345^\circ.$
Similarly, the case $z^{20} = \operatorname{cis} 300^\circ$ leads to
\[z^4 = \operatorname{cis} 60^\circ.\]The solutions to this equation are $\operatorname{cis} 15^\circ,$ $\operatorname{cis} 105^\circ,$ $\operatorname{cis} 195^\circ,$ and $\operatorname{cis} 285^\circ.$
Therefore, all the solutions are
\[\operatorname{cis} 15^\circ, \ \operatorname{cis} 75^\circ, \ \operatorname{cis} 105^\circ, \ \operatorname{cis} 165^\circ, \ \operatorname{cis} 195^\circ, \ \operatorname{cis} 255^\circ, \ \operatorname{cis} 285^\circ, \ \operatorname{cis} 345^\circ.\]The final answer is $75 + 165 + 255 + 345 = \boxed{840}.$

Then $\mathbf{p}$ is the midpoint of $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{r},$ so
\[\mathbf{p} = \frac{\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{r}}{2}.\]We can solve for $\mathbf{r},$ to find $\mathbf{r} = 2 \mathbf{p} - \mathbf{v}.$  Then
\[\mathbf{r} = 2 \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{2x - y + z}{3} \\ \frac{-x + 2y + z}{3} \\ \frac{x + y + 2z}{3} \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1} - \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{x - 2y + 2z}{3} \\ \frac{-2x + y + 2z}{3} \\ \frac{2x + 2y + z}{3} \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1} = \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{3} & -\frac{2}{3} & \frac{2}{3} \\ -\frac{2}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{2}{3} \\ \frac{2}{3} & \frac{2}{3} & \frac{1}{3} \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}.\]Hence,
\[\mathbf{R} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{3} & -\frac{2}{3} & \frac{2}{3} \\ -\frac{2}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{2}{3} \\ \frac{2}{3} & \frac{2}{3} & \frac{1}{3} \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Taking $t = 0,$ we find $\begin{pmatrix} r \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ lies on the line, so for this vector,
\[3r - 11 = 1.\]Solving, we find $r = 4.$
Taking $t = 1,$ we get
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ k \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ k + 1 \end{pmatrix}.\]For $x = 8,$ $y = 3 \cdot 8 - 11 = 13,$ so $k + 1 = 13,$ which means $k = 12.$
Hence, $(r,k) = \boxed{(4,12)}.$

Let $\mathbf{a}$ denote $\overrightarrow{A},$ etc
\[\mathbf{f} = \frac{x \mathbf{b} + (12 - x) \mathbf{a}}{12},\]so
\[\mathbf{b} = \frac{12 \mathbf{f} - (12 - x) \mathbf{a}}{x}.\]Also,
\[\mathbf{e} = \frac{2x \mathbf{c} + (16 - 2x) \mathbf{a}}{16} = \frac{x \mathbf{c} + (8 - x) \mathbf{a}}{8},\]so
\[\mathbf{c} = \frac{8 \mathbf{e} - (8 - x) \mathbf{a}}{x}.\]Then
\[\mathbf{m} = \frac{\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}}{2} = \frac{8 \mathbf{e} + 12 \mathbf{f} - (20 - 2x) \mathbf{a}}{2x} = \frac{4 \mathbf{e} + 6 \mathbf{f} - (10 - x) \mathbf{a}}{x}.\]Hence, $x \mathbf{m} + (10 - x) \mathbf{a} = 4 \mathbf{e} + 6 \mathbf{f},$ so
\[\frac{x}{10} \mathbf{m} + \frac{10 - x}{10} \mathbf{a} = \frac{4}{10} \mathbf{e} + \frac{6}{10} \mathbf{f}.\]Since the coefficients on both sides of the equation add up to 1, the vector on the left side lies on line $AM,$ and the vector on the right side lies on line $EF.$  Therefore, this common vector is $\mathbf{g}.$  Furthermore, $\frac{EG}{GF} = \frac{6}{4} = \boxed{\frac{3}{2}}.$
Note that for $x\ne1$, \begin{align*}

&=x^{36}-2x^{18}+1-x^{19}+2x^{18}-x^{17}\cr
&=x^{36}-x^{19}-x^{17}+1\cr &=x^{19}(x^{17}-1)-(x^{17}-1)\cr
&=(x^{19}-1)(x^{17}-1)
\end{align*}Then
\[P(x)=\frac{(x^{19}-1)(x^{17}-1)}{(x-1)^2}.\]Thus the zeros of $P(x)$ are the 34 complex numbers other than 1 which satisfy $x^{17}=1$ or $x^{19}=1$
It follows that $\alpha_1= \frac{1}{19},$ $\alpha_2= \frac{1}{17},$ $\alpha_3= \frac{2}{19},$ $\alpha_4= \frac{2}{17},$ and $\alpha_5= \frac{3}{19},$ so
\[\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\alpha_3+\alpha_4+\alpha_5= \boxed{\frac{159}{323}}.\]
The graph of $y=\tan \frac{x}{2}$ passes through one full period as $\frac{x}{2}$ ranges from $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $\frac{\pi}{2},$ which means $x$ ranges from $-\pi$ to $\pi.$  Thus, the period is $\pi - (-\pi) = \boxed{2 \pi}.$

By symmetry, we can focus on the octant where $x,$ $y,$ $z$ are all positive
In this octant, the condition $|x| + |y| = 1$ becomes $x + y = 1,$ which is the equation of a plane
Hence, the set of points in this octant such that $|x| + |y| \le 1$ is the set of points bound by the plane $x + y = 1,$ $x = 0,$ and $y = 0.$

This solid is bound by the planes $x = 0,$ $y = 0,$ $z = 0,$ $x + y = 1,$ $x + z = 1,$ and $y + z = 1.$  The planes $x + y = 1,$ $x + z = 1,$ and $y + z = 1$ intersect at $\left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right).$  Thus, we can compute the volume of this solid by dissecting it into three congruent pyramids
One pyramid has vertices $(0,0,0),$ $(1,0,0),$ $(0,1,0),$ and $\left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right).$  The volume of this pyramid is
\[\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{12}.\][asy]

Hence, the volume of this solid is $\frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}.$  This is the portion of the solid only in one octant, so the volume of the whole solid $S$ is $\frac{8}{4} = \boxed{2}.$

From $\cos x = \tan y,$
\[\cos^2 x = \tan^2 y = \frac{\sin^2 y}{\cos^2 y} = \frac{1 - \cos^2 y}{\cos^2 y} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 y} - 1.\]Since $\cos y = \tan z,$ $\cos^2 x = \cot^2 y - 1.$  Then
\[1 + \cos^2 x = \cot^2 z = \frac{\cos^2 z}{\sin^2 z} = \frac{\cos^2 z}{1 - \cos^2 z}.\]Since $\cos z = \tan x,$
\[1 + \cos^2 x = \frac{\tan^2 x}{1 - \tan^2 x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x - \sin^2 x}.\]We can write this as
\[1 + (1 - \sin^2 x) = \frac{\sin^2 x}{(1 - \sin^2 x) - \sin^2 x},\]so $(2 - \sin^2 x)(1 - 2 \sin^2 x) = \sin^2 x.$  This simplifies to
\[\sin^4 x - 3 \sin^2 x + 1 = 0.\]We recognize this as a quadratic in $\sin^2 x$: $(\sin^2 x)^2 - 3 \sin^2 x + 1 = 0.$  Then by the quadratic formula,
\[\sin^2 x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]Since $\frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} > 1,$ we must have
\[\sin^2 x = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]We guess that $\sin x$ is of the form $a + b \sqrt{5},$ for some numbers $a$ and $b.$  Thus,
\[(a + b \sqrt{5})^2 = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{3}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{5}.\]Expanding, we get
\[a^2 + 5b^2 + 2ab \sqrt{5} = \frac{3}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{5}.\]We set $a^2 + 5b^2 = \frac{3}{2}$ and $2ab = -\frac{1}{2}.$  Then $ab = -\frac{1}{4},$ so $b = -\frac{1}{4a}.$  Substituting into $a^2 + 5b^2 = \frac{3}{2},$ we get
\[a^2 + \frac{5}{16a^2} = \frac{3}{2}.\]Then $16a^4 + 5 = 24a^2,$ so $16a^4 - 24a^2 + 5 = 0.$  This factors as $(4a^2 - 1)(4a^2 - 5) = 0.$  Thus, possible values of $a$ are $\pm \frac{1}{2}.$  Then $b = \mp \frac{1}{2},$ so
\[\sin x = \pm \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]Let
\[\theta = \arcsin a,\]where $a = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}.$  Note that $a$ satisfies $a^2 + a - 1 = 0.$  Then
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta - \tan \theta &= \cos \theta - \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \\
&= \frac{\cos^2 \theta - \sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \\
&= \frac{1 - \sin^2 \theta - \sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \\
&= \frac{1 - a^2 - a}{\cos \theta} = 0.
\end{align*}Thus, $(x,y,z) = (\theta, \theta, \theta)$ is a solution to the given system, which means the largest possible value of $\sin x$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}}.$
Since $\begin{vmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{vmatrix} = 5,$ $ad - bc = 5.$  Then
\[\begin{vmatrix} a - c & b - d \\ c & d \end{vmatrix} = (a - c)d - (b - d)c = ad - bc = \boxed{5}.\](Why does this make sense geometrically?)
Let $O$ be the origin, and let $P = (x,y,z).$  Let $X$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to the $x$-axis
Then $\angle POX = \alpha,$ $OP = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2},$ and $OX = x,$ so
\[\cos \alpha = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}.\][asy]

Similarly, $\cos \beta = \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}$ and $\cos \gamma = \frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}.$  Hence,
\[\cos^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \beta + \cos^2 \gamma = 1.\]Since $\cos \alpha = \frac{1}{3}$ and $\cos \beta = \frac{1}{5},$
\[\cos^2 \gamma = 1 - \cos^2 \alpha - \cos^2 \beta = \frac{191}{225}.\]Since $\gamma$ is acute, $\cos \gamma = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{191}}{15}}.$
Multiplying the equation $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ by $z^2 + 1$, we get $z^6 + 1 = 0$
Multiplying this equation by $z^6 - 1 = 0$, we get $z^{12} - 1 = 0$
Therefore, every root of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ is a $12^{\text{th}}$ root of unity.
We can factor $z^{12} - 1 = 0$ as
\[(z^6 - 1)(z^6 + 1) = (z^6 - 1)(z^2 + 1)(z^4 - z^2 + 1) = 0.\]The $12^{\text{th}}$ roots of unity are $e^{0}$, $e^{2 \pi i/12}$, $e^{4 \pi i/12}$, $\dots$, $e^{22 \pi i/12}$
We see that $e^{0}$, $e^{4 \pi i/12}$, $e^{8 \pi i/12}$, $e^{12 \pi i/12}$, $e^{16 \pi i/12}$, and $e^{20 \pi i/12}$ are the roots of $z^6 - 1 = 0$
Also, $e^{6 \pi i/12} = e^{\pi i/2} = i$ and $e^{18 \pi i/12} = e^{3 \pi i/2} = -i$ are the roots of $z^2 + 1 = 0$
Thus, the roots of
\[z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0\]are the remaining four $12^{\text{th}}$ roots of unity, namely $e^{2 \pi i/12}$, $e^{10 \pi i/12}$, $e^{14 \pi i/12}$, and $e^{22 \pi i/12}$
The complex number $e^{2 \pi i/12}$ is a primitive $12^{\text{th}}$ root of unity, so by definition, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $(e^{2 \pi i/12})^n = 1$ is 12
Therefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\boxed{12}$.
Since the tangent function has period $180^\circ,$
\[\tan 1000^\circ = \tan (1000^\circ - 6 \cdot 180^\circ) = \tan (-80^\circ),\]so $n = \boxed{-80}.$
First, we can write $z^4 = -16i = 16 \operatorname{cis} 270^\circ.$  Therefore, the four roots are
\begin{align*}
&2 \operatorname{cis} 67.5^\circ, \\
&2 \operatorname{cis} (67.5^\circ + 90^\circ) = 2 \operatorname{cis} 157.5^\circ, \\
&2 \operatorname{cis} (67.5^\circ + 180^\circ) = 2 \operatorname{cis} 247.5^\circ, \\
&2 \operatorname{cis} (67.5^\circ + 270^\circ) = 2 \operatorname{cis} 337.5^\circ.
\end{align*}Then $\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3 + \theta_4 = 67.5^\circ + 157.5^\circ + 247.5^\circ + 337.5^\circ = \boxed{810^\circ}.$
Since $\mathbf{M}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 7 \\ -3 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 7 \\ -3 & -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -17 & 7 \\ -3 & -20 \end{pmatrix},$ we seek $p$ and $q$ such that
\[\begin{pmatrix} -17 & 7 \\ -3 & -20 \end{pmatrix} = p \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 7 \\ -3 & -1 \end{pmatrix} + q \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, we want $p$ and $q$ to satisfy $2p + q = -17,$ $7p = 7,$ $-3p = -3,$ and $-p + q = -20.$  Solving, we find $(p,q) = \boxed{(1,-19)}.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
(2 \cos 20^\circ + 2i \sin 20^\circ) &= 2^6 (\cos 20^\circ + i \sin 20^\circ)^6 \\
&= 64 (\cos 20^\circ + i \sin 20^\circ)^6.
\end{align*}By DeMoivre's Theorem,
\[(\cos 20^\circ + i \sin 20^\circ)^6 = \cos 120^\circ + i \sin 120^\circ = -\frac{1}{2} + i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\]so the result is $64 \left( -\frac{1}{2} + i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) = \boxed{-32 + 32i \sqrt{3}}.$

Note that line $AD$ is parallel to the normal vector of the plane, which is $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  Thus, line $AD$ can be parameterized by
\[\begin{pmatrix} -3 + t \\ 9 + t \\ 11 + t \end{pmatrix}.\]Let $P$ be the intersection of line $AD$ and the plane
Then for this intersection,
\[(-3 + t) + (-9 + t) + (11 + t) = 12.\]Solving, we find $t = -\frac{5}{3},$ and $P = \left( -\frac{14}{3}, \frac{22}{3}, \frac{28}{3} \right).$  Since $P$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AD},$
\[D = \left( 2 \left( -\frac{14}{3} \right) - (-3), 2 \cdot \frac{22}{3} - 9, 2 \cdot \frac{28}{3} - 11 \right) = \left( -\frac{19}{3}, \frac{17}{3}, \frac{23}{3} \right).\]Now,
\[\overrightarrow{DC} = \left( 3 + \frac{19}{3}, 5 - \frac{17}{3}, 9 - \frac{23}{3} \right) = \left( \frac{28}{3}, -\frac{2}{3}, \frac{4}{3} \right),\]so line $CD$ can be parameterized by
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 + 28t \\ 5 - 2t \\ 9 + 4t \end{pmatrix}.\]When it intersects the plane $x + y + z = 12,$
\[(3 + 28t) + (5 - 2t) + (9 + 4t) = 12.\]Solving, we find $t = -\frac{1}{6}.$  Therefore, $B = \boxed{\left( -\frac{5}{3}, \frac{16}{3}, \frac{25}{3} \right)}.$
The area of the triangle formed by $\mathbf{0},$ $\mathbf{a},$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is half the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf{0},$ $\mathbf{a},$ $\mathbf{b},$ and $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}.$

The area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf{0},$ $\mathbf{a},$ $\mathbf{b},$ and $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}$ is
\[|(3)(2) - (-5)(1)| = 11,\]so the area of the triangle is $\boxed{\frac{11}{2}}.$
Let $O$ be the origin
Then $\overrightarrow{H} = \overrightarrow{A} + \overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C},$ so
\begin{align*}
AH^2 &= \|\overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C}\|^2 \\
&= (\overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C}) \cdot (\overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C}) \\
&= \overrightarrow{B} \cdot \overrightarrow{B} + 2 \overrightarrow{B} \cdot \overrightarrow{C} + \overrightarrow{C} \cdot \overrightarrow{C} \\
&= R^2 + 2 \left( R^2 - \frac{a^2}{2} \right) + R^2 \\
&= 4R^2 - a^2.
\end{align*}Also, $AO^2 = R^2,$ so $4R^2 - a^2 = R^2.$  Then $a^2 = 3R^2,$ so $a = R \sqrt{3}.$
By the Extended Law of Sines,
\[\frac{a}{\sin A} = 2R,\]so $a = 2R \sin A.$  Then $\sin A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},$ so the possible values of $A$ are $\boxed{60^\circ, 120^\circ}.$
This translation takes $z$ to $z + w,$ where $w$ is a fixed complex number
\[-7 - i = (-3 + 2i) + w.\]Hence, $w = -4 - 3i.$  Then the translation takes $-4 + 5i$ to $(-4 + 5i) + (-4 - 3i) = \boxed{-8 + 2i}.$
We can write the right-hand side as
\[\sin^5 x - \cos^5 x = \frac{\sin x - \cos x}{\sin x \cos x},\]so $\sin x \cos x (\sin^5 x - \cos^5 x) = \sin x - \cos x,$ or
\[\sin x \cos x (\sin^5 x - \cos^5 x) - (\sin x - \cos x) = 0.\]We can factor to get
\[\sin x \cos x (\sin x - \cos x)(\sin^4 x + \sin^3 x \cos x + \sin^2 x \cos^2 x + \sin x \cos^3 x + \cos^4 x) - (\sin x - \cos x) = 0.\]We can write
\begin{align*}
&\sin^4 x + \sin^3 x \cos x + \sin^2 x \cos^2 x + \sin x \cos^3 x + \cos^4 x \\
&= (\sin^4 x + 2 \sin^2 x \cos^2 x + \cos^4 x) - \sin^2 x \cos^2 x + \sin x \cos x (\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x) \\
&= (\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x)^2 - \sin^2 x \cos^2 x + \sin x \cos x (\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x) \\
&= 1 + \sin x \cos x - \sin^2 x \cos^2 x,
\end{align*}so
\[\sin x \cos x (\sin x - \cos x)(1 + \sin x \cos x - \sin^2 x \cos^2 x) - (\sin x - \cos x) = 0.\]Let $p = \sin x \cos x,$ so
\[p (\sin x - \cos x)(1 + p - p^2) - (\sin x - \cos x) = 0.\]Then
\[(\sin x - \cos x)(p + p^2 - p^3 - 1) = 0,\]which factors as
\[-(\sin x - \cos x)(p - 1)^2 (p + 1) = 0.\]Since
\[|p| = |\sin x \cos x| = \frac{1}{2} |2 \sin x \cos x| = \frac{1}{2} |\sin 2x| \le \frac{1}{2},\]the value $p$ can never be 1 or $-1.$  Therefore, $\sin x = \cos x,$ or $\tan x = 1.$  The only solutions in $[0^\circ, 360^\circ]$ are $45^\circ$ and $225^\circ,$ and their sum is $\boxed{270^\circ}.$
Note that $\omega,$ $\omega^2,$ and $\lambda \omega$ form an equilateral triangle if and only if 1, $\omega,$ and $\lambda$ form an equilateral triangle.
Given 1 and $\lambda > 1,$ there are two complex numbers $\omega$ such that 1, $\omega,$ and $\lambda$ form an equilateral triangle
Both complex numbers $\omega$ have the same magnitude, so assume that the imaginary part of $\omega$ is positive.

Then the side length of the equilateral triangle is $\lambda - 1,$ so
\begin{align*}
\omega &= 1 + e^{\pi i/3} (\lambda - 1) \\
&= 1 + \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i \right) (\lambda - 1) \\
&= \frac{\lambda + 1}{2} + \frac{(\lambda - 1) \sqrt{3}}{2} i.
\end{align*}Hence,
\begin{align*}
|\omega|^2 &= \left( \frac{\lambda + 1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{(\lambda - 1) \sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2 \\
&= \frac{\lambda^2 + 2 \lambda + 1}{4} + \frac{3 \lambda^2 - 6 \lambda + 3}{4} \\
&= \frac{4 \lambda^2 - 4 \lambda + 4}{4} = \lambda^2 - \lambda + 1.
\end{align*}But $|\omega|^2 = 2^2 = 4,$ so $\lambda^2 - \lambda + 1 = 4,$ or
\[\lambda^2 - \lambda - 3 = 0.\]By the quadratic formula,
\[\lambda = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2}.\]Since $\lambda > 1,$
\[\lambda = \boxed{\frac{1 + \sqrt{13}}{2}}.\]
Note that
\[\cos^2 \phi = 1 - \sin^2 \phi = \frac{9}{10}.\]Since $\phi$ is acute, $\cos \phi = \frac{3}{\sqrt{10}}.$  Then
\[\tan \phi = \frac{\sin \phi}{\cos \phi} = \frac{1}{3},\]so
\[\tan 2 \phi = \frac{2 \tan \phi}{1 - \tan^2 \phi} = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{1 - (\frac{1}{3})^2} = \frac{3}{4},\]and
\[\tan (\theta + 2 \phi) = \frac{\tan \theta + \tan 2 \phi}{1 - \tan \theta \tan 2 \phi} = \frac{\frac{1}{7} + \frac{3}{4}}{1 - \frac{1}{7} \cdot \frac{3}{4}} = 1.\]Since $\tan 2 \phi$ is positive, $2 \phi$ is also acute
Hence, $0 < \theta + 2 \phi < \pi.$   Therefore, $\theta + 2 \phi = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{4}}.$
From the sum-to-product formula,
\[\sin 120^\circ - \sin x^\circ = 2 \sin \frac{120^\circ - x^\circ}{2} \cos \frac{120^\circ + x^\circ}{2}\]and
\[\cos 120^\circ - \cos x^\circ = -2 \sin \frac{120^\circ + x^\circ}{2} \sin \frac{120^\circ - x^\circ}{2},\]so
\begin{align*}
\tan (120^\circ - x^\circ) &= \frac{\sin 120^\circ - \sin x^\circ}{\cos 120^\circ - \cos x^\circ} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin \frac{120^\circ - x^\circ}{2} \cos \frac{120^\circ + x^\circ}{2}}{-2 \sin \frac{120^\circ + x^\circ}{2} \sin \frac{120^\circ - x^\circ}{2}} \\
&= -\frac{\cos \frac{120^\circ + x^\circ}{2}}{\sin \frac{120^\circ + x^\circ}{2}} \\
&= -\cot \left( \frac{120^\circ + x^\circ}{2} \right).
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
-\cot \left( \frac{120^\circ + x^\circ}{2} \right) &= -\tan \left( 90^\circ - \frac{120^\circ + x^\circ}{2} \right) \\
&= -\tan \left( \frac{60^\circ - x^\circ}{2} \right) \\
&= \tan \left (\frac{x^\circ - 60^\circ}{2} \right).
\end{align*}Thus,
\[120^\circ - x^\circ - \frac{x^\circ - 60^\circ}{2} = 180^\circ n\]for some integer $n.$  Solving, we find
\[x = 100 - 120n.\]Since $0 < x < 180,$ $x = \boxed{100}.$
Since $\mathbf{v}_n$ is always a projection onto $\mathbf{v}_0,$
\[\mathbf{v}_n = a_n \mathbf{v}_0\]for some constant $a_n.$  Similarly,
\[\mathbf{w}_n = b_n \mathbf{w}_0\]for some constant $b_n.$

\begin{align*}
\mathbf{v}_n &= \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{v}_0} \mathbf{w}_{n - 1} \\
&= \frac{\mathbf{w}_{n - 1} \cdot \mathbf{v}_0}{\|\mathbf{v}_0\|^2} \mathbf{v}_0 \\
&= \frac{b_{n - 1} \cdot \mathbf{w}_0 \cdot \mathbf{v}_0}{\|\mathbf{v}_0\|^2} \mathbf{v}_0 \\
&= \frac{b_{n - 1} \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \right\|^2} \mathbf{v}_0 \\
&= \frac{2}{5} b_{n - 1} \mathbf{v}_0.
\end{align*}Thus, $a_n = \frac{2}{5} b_{n - 1}.$
Similarly,
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{w}_n &= \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{w}_0} \mathbf{v}_n \\
&= \frac{\mathbf{v}_n \cdot \mathbf{w}_0}{\|\mathbf{w}_0\|^2} \mathbf{w}_0 \\
&= \frac{a_n \cdot \mathbf{v}_0 \cdot \mathbf{w}_0}{\|\mathbf{v}_0\|^2} \mathbf{w}_0 \\
&= \frac{a_n \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\|^2} \mathbf{w}_0 \\
&= \frac{1}{4} a_n \mathbf{w}_0.
\end{align*}Thus, $b_n = \frac{1}{4} a_n.$
Since $b_0 = 1,$ $a_1 = \frac{2}{5}.$  Also, for $n \ge 2,$
\[a_n = \frac{2}{5} b_{n - 1} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{4} a_{n - 1} = \frac{1}{10} a_{n - 1}.\]Thus, $(a_n)$ is a geometric sequence with first term $\frac{2}{5}$ and common ratio $\frac{1}{10},$ so
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2 + \mathbf{v}_3 + \dotsb &= \frac{2}{5} \mathbf{v_0} + \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{10} \cdot \mathbf{v}_0 + \frac{2}{5} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{10} \right)^2 \cdot \mathbf{v}_0 + \dotsb \\
&= \frac{2/5}{1 - 1/10} \mathbf{v}_0 = \frac{4}{9} \mathbf{v}_0 = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 4/9 \\ 4/3 \end{pmatrix}}.
\end{align*}
Note that the vector $\mathbf{p}$ must lie on the line passing through $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}.$  This line can be parameterized by

The vector $\mathbf{p}$ itself will be orthogonal to the direction vector $\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},$ so
\[\begin{pmatrix} -5t + 4 \\ 2t + 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = 0.\]Hence, $(-5t + 4)(-5) + (2t + 1)(2) = 0.$  Solving, we find $t = \frac{18}{29}.$  Hence, $\mathbf{p} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 26/29 \\ 65/29 \end{pmatrix}}.$
Note that the projecting the vector $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$ onto itself results in itself, so
\[\begin{pmatrix} \frac{4}{29} & -\frac{10}{29} \\ -\frac{10}{29} & \frac{25}{29} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}.\]Then $\frac{4}{29} x - \frac{10}{29} y = x$ and $-\frac{10}{29} x + \frac{25}{29} y = y.$  Both equations lead to $\frac{y}{x} = \boxed{-\frac{5}{2}}.$
From the given equation,
\begin{align*}
\sin \theta &= \cos 5^\circ - \sin 25^\circ \\
&= \cos 5^\circ - \cos 65^\circ.
\end{align*}By the sum-to-product formula,
\begin{align*}
\cos 5^\circ - \cos 65^\circ &= -2 \sin 35^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) \\
&= \sin 35^\circ.
\end{align*}Thus, the smallest such $\theta$ is $\boxed{35^\circ}.$
In general, for a matrix $\mathbf{M},$ $\mathbf{M} \mathbf{i},$ $\mathbf{M} \mathbf{j},$ and $\mathbf{M} \mathbf{k}$ are equal to the first, second, and third columns of $\mathbf{M},$ respectively
Therefore,
\[\mathbf{M} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 7 \\ 3 & 5 & -1 \\ -8 & -2 & 4 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
For $r = 4 \cos \theta,$
\begin{align*}
x &= r \cos \theta = 4 \cos^2 \theta = 2 \cos 2 \theta + 2, \\
y &= r \sin \theta = 4 \sin \theta \cos \theta = 2 \sin 2 \theta.
\end{align*}Hence,
\[(x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 4 \cos^2 2 \theta + 4 \sin^2 2 \theta = 4.\]Thus, the graph of $r = 4 \cos \theta$ is the circle centered at $(2,0)$ with radius 2.
For $r = 8 \sin \theta,$
\begin{align*}
x &= r \cos \theta = 8 \sin \theta \cos \theta = 4 \sin 2 \theta, \\
y &= r \sin \theta = 8 \sin^2 \theta = 4 - 4 \cos 2 \theta.
\end{align*}Hence,
\[x^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \sin^2 2 \theta + 16 \cos^2 2 \theta = 16.\]Thus, the graph of $r = 8 \sin \theta$ is the circle centered at $(0,4)$ with radius 4.
Plotting these circles, we find that they intersect at $\boxed{2}$ points.

If $O$ is the origin, then we know
$$H = \overrightarrow{A} + \overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C}.$$Therefore
\begin{align*}
OH^2 &= |\overrightarrow{OH}|^2 \\
&= |\overrightarrow{A} + \overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C}|^2 \\
&= (\overrightarrow{A} + \overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C}) \cdot (\overrightarrow{A} + \overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C}) \\
&= \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{A} + \overrightarrow{B} \cdot \overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C} \cdot \overrightarrow{C} + 2 \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{B} + 2 \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{C} + 2 \overrightarrow{B} \cdot \overrightarrow{C}.
\end{align*}Using what we know about these dot products given that the origin is the circumcenter, we have:
\begin{align*}
OH^2 &= R^2 + R^2 + R^2 + 2 \left( R^2 - \frac{c^2}{2} \right) + 2 \left( R^2 - \frac{b^2}{2} \right) + 2 \left( R^2 - \frac{a^2}{2} \right) \\
&= 9R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \\
&= 9 \cdot 7^2 - 29 \\
&= \boxed{412}.
\end{align*}
Let $\mathbf{a}$ denote $\overrightarrow{A},$ etc
Then from the given information
\[\mathbf{d} = \frac{2}{5} \mathbf{a} + \frac{3}{5} \mathbf{b}\]and

Isolating $\mathbf{b}$ in each equation, we obtain
\[\mathbf{b} = \frac{5 \mathbf{d} - 2 \mathbf{a}}{3} = \frac{5 \mathbf{e} - 3 \mathbf{c}}{2}.\]Then $10 \mathbf{d} - 4 \mathbf{a} = 15 \mathbf{e} - 9 \mathbf{c},$ or $9 \mathbf{c} - 4 \mathbf{a} = 15 \mathbf{e} - 10 \mathbf{d},$ so
\[\frac{9}{5} \mathbf{c} - \frac{4}{5} \mathbf{a} = \frac{15}{5} \mathbf{e} - \frac{10}{5} \mathbf{d}.\]Since the coefficients on both sides of the equation add up to 1, the vector on the left side lies on line $AC,$ and the vector on the right side lies on line $DE.$  Therefore, this common vector is $\mathbf{f}.$
Hence,
\[\mathbf{f} = \frac{15}{5} \mathbf{e} - \frac{10}{5} \mathbf{d} = 3 \mathbf{e} - 2 \mathbf{d}.\]Re-arranging, we get
\[\mathbf{e} = \frac{2}{3} \mathbf{d} + \frac{1}{3} \mathbf{f}.\]Therefore, $\frac{DE}{EF} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
Let $\mathbf{r}_1,$ $\mathbf{r}_2,$ $\mathbf{r}_3$ be the row vectors of $\mathbf{M},$ and let $\mathbf{c}_1,$ $\mathbf{c}_2,$ $\mathbf{c}_3$ be the column vectors of $\mathbf{N},$ so
\[\mathbf{M} \mathbf{N} = \begin{pmatrix} -\mathbf{r}_1- \\ -\mathbf{r}_2- \\ -\mathbf{r}_3- \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} | & | & | \\ \mathbf{c}_1 & \mathbf{c}_2 & \mathbf{c}_3 \\ | & | & | \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{r}_1 \cdot \mathbf{c}_1 & \mathbf{r}_1 \cdot \mathbf{c}_2 & \mathbf{r}_1 \cdot \mathbf{c}_3 \\ \mathbf{r}_2 \cdot \mathbf{c}_1 & \mathbf{r}_2 \cdot \mathbf{c}_2 & \mathbf{r}_2 \cdot \mathbf{c}_3 \\ \mathbf{r}_3 \cdot \mathbf{c}_1 & \mathbf{r}_3 \cdot \mathbf{c}_2 & \mathbf{r}_3 \cdot \mathbf{c}_3 \end{pmatrix}.\]We want the first row of $\mathbf{MN}$ to be the second row of $\mathbf{N},$ which corresponds to the second entry of $\mathbf{c}_j$ for each $j.$  Thus, we can take $\mathbf{r}_1 = (0,1,0).$
Also, we want the second row of $\mathbf{MN}$ to be the first row of $\mathbf{N},$ which corresponds to the first entry of $\mathbf{c}_j$ for each $j.$  Thus, we can take $\mathbf{r}_2 = (1,0,0).$
Finally, we want the third row of $\mathbf{MN}$ to be double the third row of $\mathbf{N}.$   The elements in the third row of $\mathbf{N}$ correspond to the third entry of $\mathbf{c}_j$ for each $j.$  Thus, we can take $\mathbf{r}_3 = (0,0,2).$  Hence,
\[\mathbf{M} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Let the point be $(x,y,z).$  Each coordinate can only be 0, $\pm 1,$ $\pm 2,$ or $\pm 3.$  Checking we find that up to sign, the only possible combinations of $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ that work are either two 0s and one 3, or one 1 and two 2s.
If there are two 0s and one 3, then there are 3 ways to place the 3
Then the 3 can be positive or negative, which gives us $3 \cdot 2 = 6$ points.
If there is one 1 and two 2s, then there are 3 ways to place the 1
Then each coordinate can be positive or negative, which gives us $3 \cdot 2^3 = 24$ points.
Therefore, there are $6 + 24 = \boxed{30}$ such lattice points.
We know that $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1.$  Substituting $\sin x = 3 \cos x,$ we get
\[9 \cos^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1,\]so $10 \cos^2 x = 1,$ or $\cos^2 x = \frac{1}{10}.$  Then
\[\sin x \cos x = (3 \cos x)(\cos x) = 3 \cos^2 x = \boxed{\frac{3}{10}}.\]
We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c \\ b & c & a \\ c & a & b \end{vmatrix} &= a \begin{vmatrix} c & a \\ a & b \end{vmatrix} - b \begin{vmatrix} b & a \\ c & b \end{vmatrix} + c \begin{vmatrix} b & c \\ c & a \end{vmatrix} \\
&= a(bc - a^2) - b(b^2 - ac) + c(ab - c^2) \\
&= 3abc - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3).
\end{align*}We can factor $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc$ as
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc).\]By Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c = 0,$ so the determinant is equal to $\boxed{0}.$
Let $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix},$ and $\mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} t \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  Then the area of triangle $ABC$ is given by
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} \|(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (\mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a})\| &= \frac{1}{2} \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} t + 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \left\| \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 + t \\ -1 - t \end{pmatrix} \right\| \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(-1)^2 + (3 + t)^2 + (-1 - t)^2} \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2t^2 + 8t + 11}.
\end{align*}Completing the square on $2t^2 + 8t + 11,$ we get
\[2(t + 2)^2 + 3.\]Thus, the smallest possible area of the triangle is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}.$
Let $\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 5 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},$ and $\mathbf{w} = \begin{pmatrix} 15 \\ 11 \\ 9 \end{pmatrix}.$
\[\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\]and
\[\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 9 \\ 6 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = 3 (\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{u}).\]Since $\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{u}$ is a scalar multiple of $\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{u},$ all three vectors are collinear, so the area of the "triangle" is $\boxed{0}.$

We can construct a right triangle with legs $a^2 - b^2$ and $2ab.$  Then by Pythagoras, the hypotenuse is

By DeMoivre's Theorem,
\begin{align*}
\cos 5 \theta + i \sin 5 \theta &= (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)^5 \\
&= \cos^5 \theta + 5i \cos^4 \theta \sin \theta - 10 \cos^3 \theta \sin^2 \theta - 10i \cos^2 \theta \sin^3 \theta + 5 \cos \theta \sin^4 \theta + i \sin^5 \theta.
\end{align*}Equating real parts, we get
\[\cos 5 \theta = \cos^5 \theta - 10 \cos^3 \theta \sin^2 \theta + 5 \cos \theta \sin^4 \theta.\]Since $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{3},$ $\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta = \frac{8}{9}.$  Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\cos 5 \theta &= \cos^5 \theta - 10 \cos^3 \theta \sin^2 \theta + 5 \cos \theta \sin^4 \theta \\
&= \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^5 - 10 \left (\frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \frac{8}{9} + 5 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \left( \frac{8}{9} \right)^2 \\
&= \boxed{\frac{241}{243}}.

Let $\theta = \angle AOC = \angle BOD.$  Then by the Law of Cosines on triangle $BOD,$
\[\cos \theta = \frac{4^2 + 5^2 - 8^2}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 5} = -\frac{23}{40}.\]Then by the Law of Cosines on triangle $AOC,$
\begin{align*}
x^2 &= 4^2 + 10^2 - 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 10 \cos \theta \\
&= 4^2 + 10^2 - 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 10 \cdot \left( -\frac{23}{40} \right) \\
&= 162,
\end{align*}so $x = \sqrt{162} = \boxed{9 \sqrt{2}}.$
Expanding the determinant, we get
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} \tan 1 & 1  & 1 \\ 1 & \tan B & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & \tan C \end{vmatrix} &= \tan A \begin{vmatrix} \tan B & 1 \\ 1 & \tan C \end{vmatrix} - \begin{vmatrix} 1  & 1 \\ 1 & \tan C \end{vmatrix} + \begin{vmatrix} 1 & \tan B \\ 1 & 1 \end{vmatrix} \\

&= \tan A \tan B \tan C - \tan A - \tan B - \tan C + 2.
\end{align*}From the tangent addition formula,
\[\tan (A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}.\]But
\[\tan (A + B) = \tan (180^\circ - C) = -\tan C,\]so
\[-\tan C = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}.\]Then $-\tan C + \tan A \tan B \tan C = \tan A + \tan B.$  Therefore,
\[\tan A \tan B \tan C - \tan A - \tan B - \tan C + 2 = \boxed{2}.\]

Hence, $EF = \frac{BC}{2},$ so

\[\frac{AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2}{l^2 + m^2 + n^2} = \frac{(4l^2 + 4m^2) + (4l^2 + 4n^2) + (4m^2 + 4n^2)}{l^2 + m^2 + n^2} = \frac{8l^2 + 8m^2 + 8n^2}{l^2 + m^2 + n^2} = \boxed{8}.\]

Since this point lies on the hyperbola, we have $(x_{n+1} - x_n)^2 - x_{n+1}^2 = 1$
Rearranging this equation gives \[
x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 - 1}{2x_n}.
\]Choose a $\theta_0 \in (0, \pi)$ with $\cot\theta_0 = x_0$, and define $\theta_n = 2^n \theta_0$
Using the double-angle formula, we have \[
\cot \theta_{n+1} = \cot( 2 \theta_n ) = \frac{\cot^2 \theta_n - 1}{2 \cot \theta_n}.
\]It follows by induction that $x_n = \cot \theta_n$
Then, $P_0 = P_{2008}$ corresponds to $\cot \theta_0 = \cot ( 2^{2008} \theta_0 )$ (assuming that $P_0$ is never at the origin, or equivalently, $2^{n} \theta$ is never an integer multiple of $\pi$).
So, we need to find the number of $\theta_0 \in (0, \pi)$ with the property that $2^{2008} \theta_0 - \theta_0 = k \pi$ for some integer $k$
We have $\theta_0 = \frac{k \pi}{2^{2008} - 1}$, so $k$ can be any integer between $1$ and $2^{2008}-2$ inclusive (and note that since the denominator is odd, the sequence never terminates)
It follows that the number of starting positions is $\boxed{2^{2008} -2}$.
Let $P$ and $Q$ be the points on $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$, respectively, where the paper is folded.
Let $x = BP.$  Then $PA = PA' = 12 - x,$ so by the Law of Cosines on triangle $PBA',$
\[x^2 - 9x + 81 = (12 - x)^2.\]Solving, we find $x = \frac{21}{5},$ so $PA = \frac{39}{5}.$
Let $y = CQ.$  Then $QA = QA' = 12 - y,$ so by the Law of Cosines on triangle $QCA',$
\[y^2 - 3y + 9 = (12 - y)^2.\]Solving, we find $y = \frac{45}{7},$ so $QA = \frac{39}{7}.$
Therefore, by the Law of Cosines on triangle $PAQ,$
\[PQ^2 = PA^2 - PA \cdot QA + QA^2 = \boxed{\frac{59319}{1225}}.\][asy]

We have that
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 7 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & -5 \\ 0 & 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (2)(1) + (3)(0) & (2)(-5) + (3)(4) \\ (7)(1) + (-1)(0) & (7)(-5) + (-1)(4) \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\ 7 & -39 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Since the cosine function has period $360^\circ,$
\[\cos 758^\circ = \cos (758^\circ - 2 \cdot 360^\circ) = \cos 38^\circ,\]so $n = \boxed{38}.$
We see that $\mathcal{T}$ is the triangle whose vertices are $(1,0,0),$ $(0,1,0),$ and $(0,0,1).$  We are looking for the points $(x,y,z) \in \mathcal{T}$ such that exactly two of the following inequalities hold: $x \ge \frac{1}{2},$ $y \ge \frac{1}{3},$ and $z \ge \frac{1}{6}.$
The plane $x = \frac{1}{2}$ cuts triangle $\mathcal{T}$ in a line that is parallel to one of its sides
The same holds for the planes $y = \frac{1}{3}$ and $z = \frac{1}{6}.$
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the set of points in $\mathcal{T}$ such that $x \ge \frac{1}{2}$ and $y \ge \frac{1}{3}.$  Then the inequality $z \le \frac{1}{6}$ is automatically satisfied, and $z = \frac{1}{6}$ only for the point $\left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{6} \right).$  Thus, $\mathcal{A}$ is a triangle which is similar to $\mathcal{T},$ and the ratio of their areas is $\frac{1}{6^2} = \frac{1}{36}.$

Likewise, let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of points in $\mathcal{T}$ such that $x \ge \frac{1}{2}$ and $z \ge \frac{1}{6},$ and let $\mathcal{C}$ be the set of points in $\mathcal{T}$ such that $y \ge \frac{1}{3}$ and $z \ge \frac{1}{6}.$  Then $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ are triangles that are also similar to $\mathcal{T},$ and the ratio of their areas to the area of $\mathcal{T}$ are $\frac{1}{3^2} = \frac{1}{9}$ and $\frac{1}{2^2} = \frac{1}{4},$ respectively.
Therefore, the area of $\mathcal{S}$ divided by the area of $\mathcal{T}$ is $\frac{1}{36} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{\frac{7}{18}}.$

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{DE}$
Then triangle $ACM$ is a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle with $MC = 3$, $AC = 6,$ and $AM = 3\sqrt{3}.$ Since triangle $AME$ is right, we use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $AE = 2 \sqrt{7}$.
The area of triangle $DAE$ is
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot DE \cdot AM = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \sqrt{3} = 3 \sqrt{3}.\]The area of triangle $DAE$ is also
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot AE \cdot \sin \angle DAE = 14 \sin \angle DAE.\]Therefore, $\sin \angle DAE = \boxed{\frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{14}}.$
The direction vectors of the lines are $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}.$  The cosine of the angle between these direction vectors is
\[\frac{\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} = \frac{15}{\sqrt{25} \sqrt{10}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{10}}.\]Hence, $\cos \theta = \boxed{\frac{3}{\sqrt{10}}}.$
Let $a = e^{ix}$, $b = e^{iy}$, and $c = e^{iz}$
\begin{align*}
a + b + c &= e^{ix} + e^{iy} + e^{iz} \\
&= (\cos x + \cos y + \cos z) + i (\sin x + \sin y + \sin z) \\
\end{align*}Also,
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} &= \frac{1}{e^{ix}} + \frac{1}{e^{iy}} + \frac{1}{e^{iz}} \\
&= e^{-ix} + e^{-iy} + e^{-iz} \\
&= [\cos (-x) + \cos (-y) + \cos (-z)] + i [\sin (-x) + \sin (-y) + \sin (-z)] \\
&= (\cos x + \cos y + \cos z) - i (\sin x + \sin y + \sin z) \\
\end{align*}Hence,
\[abc \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \right) = ab + ac + bc = 0.\]Now,
\begin{align*}
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 &= e^{2ix} + e^{2iy} + e^{2iz} \\
&= (\cos 2x + \cos 2y + \cos 2z) + i (\sin 2x + \sin 2y + \sin 2z).
\end{align*}Squaring $a + b + c = 0,$ we get
\[(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc) = 0.\]Therefore, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 0,$ which means the only possible value of $\cos 2x + \cos 2y + \cos 2z$ is $\boxed{0}.$
Let $O$ be the origin

Let $z_2 = \omega z_1,$ where $\omega = e^{\pi i/3}.$  Then by Vieta's formulas,

b &= z_1 z_2 = \omega z_1^2.
\end{align*}Hence,

\frac{a^2}{b} &= \frac{(1 + \omega)^2 z_1^2}{\omega z_1^2} \\

Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}.$  Then

\[\mathbf{M} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 &  8 & 2 \\ -8 & 0 & -5 \\ -2 & 5 & 0 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
The graph of $y = \sin 5x$ passes through one full period as $5x$ ranges from $0$ to $2\pi$, which means $x$ ranges from $0$ to $\boxed{\frac{2\pi}{5}}.$

Expanding $(\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I})(\mathbf{A} - 4 \mathbf{I}) = \mathbf{0},$ we get
\[\mathbf{A}^2 - 6 \mathbf{A} + 8 \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{0}.\]Multiplying both sides by $\mathbf{A}^{-1},$ we get
\[\mathbf{A} - 6 \mathbf{I} + 8 \mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{0}.\]Then
\[\mathbf{A} + 8 \mathbf{A}^{-1} = 6 \mathbf{I} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 6 & 0 \\ 0 & 6 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Since $\mathbf{v}$ is a unit vector lying in the $xz$-plane, it is of the form $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ 0 \\ z \end{pmatrix},$ where $x^2 + z^2 = 1.$
Since it makes an angle of $45^\circ$ with $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix},$
\[\frac{\begin{pmatrix} x \\ 0 \\ z \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 0 \\ z \end{pmatrix} \right\| \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} = \cos 45^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.\]Then
\[\frac{2x - z}{3} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\]so $2x - z = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}.$
Since $\mathbf{v}$ makes an angle of $60^\circ$ with $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix},$
\[\frac{\begin{pmatrix} x \\ 0 \\ z \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 0 \\ z \end{pmatrix} \right\| \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} = \cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}.\]Then
\[\frac{-z}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2},\]so $z = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.$  Then we can solve for $x,$ to get $x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.$  Thus, $\mathbf{v} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{2}/2 \\ 0 \\ -\sqrt{2}/2 \end{pmatrix}}.$
From the formula,
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ -1 & 7 \end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \frac{1}{(2)(7) - (3)(-1)} \begin{pmatrix} 7 & -3 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 7/17 & -3/17 \\ 1/17 & 2/17 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
A $45^\circ$ rotation in the counter-clockwise direction corresponds to multiplication by $\operatorname{cis} 45^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}},$ and the dilation corresponds to multiplication by $\sqrt{2}.$  Therefore, both transformations correspond to multiplication by $\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{2} = 1 + i.$

This means the image of $-3 - 8i$ is $(-3 - 8i)(1 + i) = \boxed{5 - 11i}.$
Let $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.$  The line can be parameterized by
\[\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 + t \\ 2 - 3t \\ 1 + 2t \end{pmatrix}.\]If $\bold{v}$ is the vector that is closest to $\bold{a}$, then the vector joining $\bold{v}$ and $\bold{a}$ is orthogonal to the direction vector of the line
This vector is
\[\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 + t \\ 2 - 3t \\ 1 + 2t \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 + t \\ 3 - 3t \\ -1 + 2t \end{pmatrix}.\][asy]

dot("$\mathbf{a}$", A, N);

[/asy]
Hence,
\[\begin{pmatrix} -3 + t \\ 3 - 3t \\ -1 + 2t \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = 0,\]so $(-3 + t)(1) + (3 - 3t)(-3) + (-1 + 2t)(2) = 0.$  Solving for $t$, we find $t = 1.$
Then the distance between the point and the line is
\[\| \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{a} \| = \left\| \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \boxed{\sqrt{5}}.\]
Expanding, we get
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \left( \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 8 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} x + 2 \\ y - 8 \end{pmatrix} = (x + 2) + 3(y - 8) = 0.\]Solving for $y,$ we find
\[y = -\frac{1}{3} x + \frac{22}{3}.\]Thus, $(m,b) = \boxed{\left( -\frac{1}{3}, \frac{22}{3} \right)}.$
The plane $-2x + y - 3z = 7$ has normal vector $\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix},$ so the plane we seek will also have this normal vector
In other words, the plane will have an equation of the form
\[-2x + y - 3z + D = 0.\]Since we want the coefficient of $x$ to be positive, we can multiply by $-1$ to get
\[2x - y + 3z - D = 0.\]Setting $x = 1,$ $y = 4,$ and $z = -2,$ we get $-8 - D = 0,$ so $D = -8.$  Thus, the equation we seek is
\[\boxed{2x - y + 3z + 8 = 0}.\]
Let $\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}.$  Note that
\[\mathbf{M} (\mathbf{M}^3 - 4 \mathbf{M}^2 + 5 \mathbf{M}) = \mathbf{M}^4 - 4 \mathbf{M}^3 + 5 \mathbf{M}^2 = (\mathbf{M}^3 - 4 \mathbf{M}^2 + 5 \mathbf{M}) \mathbf{M},\]so
\[\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 10 & 20 \\ 5 & 10 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 10 & 20 \\ 5 & 10 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}.\]This becomes
\[\begin{pmatrix} 10a + 5b & 20a + 10b \\ 10c + 5d & 20c + 10d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 10a + 20c & 10b + 20d \\ 5a + 10c & 5b + 10d \end{pmatrix}.\]Comparing entries, we get
\begin{align*}
10a + 5b &= 10a + 20c, \\
20a + 10b &= 10b + 20d, \\
10c + 5d &= 5a + 10c, \\
20c + 10d &= 5b + 10d.
\end{align*}Then from the first and second equations, $5b = 20c$ and $20a = 20d,$ so $b = 4c$ and $a = d.$  (The other equations give us the same information.)  Thus,
\[\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} a & 4c \\ c & a \end{pmatrix}.\]Then
\[\mathbf{M}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & 4c \\ c & a \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & 4c \\ c & a \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + 4c^2 & 8ac \\ 2ac & a^2 + 4c^2 \end{pmatrix},\]and
\[\mathbf{M}^3 = \begin{pmatrix} a & 4c \\ c & a \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + 4c^2 & 8ac \\ 2ac & a^2 + 4c^2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a^3 + 12ac^2 & 12a^2 c + 16c^3 \\ 3a^2 c + 4c^3 & a^3 + 12ac^2 \end{pmatrix}.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{M}^3 - 4 \mathbf{M}^2 + 5 \mathbf{M} &= \begin{pmatrix} a^3 + 12ac^2 & 12a^2 c + 16c^3 \\ 3a^2 c + 4c^3 & a^3 + 12ac^2 \end{pmatrix} - 4 \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + 4c^2 & 8ac \\ 2ac & a^2 + 4c^2 \end{pmatrix} + 5 \begin{pmatrix} a & 4c \\ c & a \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} a^3 + 12ac^2 - 4a^2 - 16c^2 + 5a & 12a^2 c + 16c^3 - 32ac + 20c \\ 3a^2 c + 4c^3 - 8ac + 5c & a^3 + 12ac^2 - 4a^2 - 16c^2 + 5a \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}Again comparing entries, we get
\begin{align*}
a^3 + 12ac^2 - 4a^2 - 16c^2 + 5a &= 10, \\
3a^2 c + 4c^3 - 8ac + 5c &= 5.
\end{align*}Then
\[(a^3 + 12ac^2 - 4a^2 - 16c^2 + 5a) - 2 (3a^2 c + 4c^3 - 8ac + 5c) = 0.\]Expanding, we get
\[a^3 - 6a^2 c + 12ac^2 - 8c^3 - 4a^2 + 16ac - 16c^2 + 5a - 10c = 0,\]which we can write as
\[(a - 2c)^3 - 4(a - 2c)^2 + 5(a - 2c) = 0.\]Let $x = a - 2c,$ so
\[x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x = 0,\]which factors as $x(x^2 - 4x + 5) = 0.$  The quadratic factor has no real roots, so $x = 0,$ which means $a = 2c.$
Substituting into the equation $3a^2 c + 4c^3 - 8ac + 5c = 5,$ we get
\[3(2c)^2 c + 4c^3 - 8(2c) c + 5c = 5,\]which simplifies to $16c^3 - 16c^2 + 5c - 5 = 0.$  This factors as $(c - 1)(16c^2 + 5) = 0,$ so $c = 1.$  It follows that $a = 2,$ $b = 4,$ and $d = 2,$ so
\[\mathbf{M} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 4 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We can write
\[\cos \alpha + i \sin \alpha + \cos \beta + i \sin \beta = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{7} i,\]so $\cos \alpha + \cos \beta = \frac{1}{4}$ and $\sin \alpha + \sin \beta = \frac{3}{7}.$  Therefore,
\begin{align*}
e^{-i \alpha} + e^{-i \beta} &= \cos (-\alpha) + i \sin (-\alpha) + \cos (-\beta) + i \sin (-\beta) \\
&= \cos \alpha - i \sin \alpha + \cos \beta - i \sin \beta \\
&= \boxed{\frac{1}{4} - \frac{3}{7} i}.
\end{align*}

Since the dilation is centered at $-1 + 4i,$ with scale factor $-2,$
\[z - (-1 + 4i) = (-2)(2i - (-1 + 4i)).\]Solving, we find $z = \boxed{-3 + 8i}.$

Let $\bold{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}$, $\bold{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}$, and $\bold{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix}$
Let $\bold{v} = \bold{a} - \bold{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$.
Letting $\bold{p}$ be the projection of $\bold{v}$ onto $\bold{d}$, we have
\begin{align*}
\bold{p} &= \text{proj}_{\bold{d}} \bold{v} \\
&= \frac{\bold{v} \cdot \bold{d}}{\bold{d} \cdot \bold{d}} \bold{d} \\
&= \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= -\frac{13}{50} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{13}{50} \\ \frac{91}{50} \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}Thus, if $\bold{c} = \bold{b} + \bold{p}$, then the vector joining $\bold{a}$ and $\bold{c}$ is orthogonal to $\bold{d}$
We have that
\[\bold{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{13}{50} \\ \frac{91}{50} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{37}{50} \\ -\frac{159}{50} \end{pmatrix},\]so the distance between the two parallel lines is
\[\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} \frac{37}{50} \\ -\frac{159}{50} \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \left\| \begin{pmatrix} \frac{63}{50} \\ \frac{9}{50} \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \boxed{\frac{9 \sqrt{2}}{10}}.\]
From the equation, $\frac{x + 1}{-3} = \frac{y - 3}{2},$
\[2x + 3y - 7 = 0.\]From the equation $\frac{y - 3}{2} = \frac{z + 2}{1},$
\[y - 2z - 7 = 0.\]So, any point on the line given in the problem will satisfy $2x + 3y - 7 = 0$ and $y - 2z - 7 = 0,$ which means it will also satisfy any equation of the form
\[a(2x + 3y - 7) + b(y - 2z - 7) = 0,\]where $a$ and $b$ are constants.
We also want the plane to contain $(0,7,-7).$  Plugging in these values, we get
\[14a + 14b = 0.\]Thus, we can take $a = 1$ and $b = -1.$  This gives us
\[(2x + 3y - 7) - (y - 2z - 7) = 0,\]which simplifies to $2x + 2y + 2z = 0.$  Thus, the equation of the plane is $\boxed{x + y + z = 0}.$
In the octant where $x \ge 0,$ $y \ge 0,$ and $z \ge 0,$ the inequality $|x| + |y| + |z| \le 1$ becomes
\[x + y + z \le 1.\]Thus, the region in this octant is the tetrahedron with vertices $(0,0,0),$ $(1,0,0),$ $(0,1,0),$ and $(1,0,0).$  By symmetry, the region defined by $|x| + |y| + |z| \le 1$ is the octahedron with vertices $(\pm 1,0,0),$ $(0,\pm 1,0),$ and $(0,0,\pm 1).$  Let the base of the upper-half of the octahedron be $ABCD,$ and let $E = (0,0,1).$
Similarly, the region defined by $|x| + |y| + |z - 1| \le 1$ is also an octahedron, centered at $(0,0,1).$  Let the base of the lower-half of the octahedron be $A'B'C'D',$ and let $E' = (0,0,0).$

Faces $ABE$ and $A'B'E'$ intersect in line segment $\overline{MN},$ where $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AE},$ and $N$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BE}.$  Thus, the intersection of the two octahedra is another octahedra, consisting of the upper-half of pyramid $ABCDE,$ and the lower-half of pyramid $A'B'C'D'E'.$
The volume of pyramid $ABCDE$ is
\[\frac{1}{3} \cdot (\sqrt{2})^2 \cdot 1 = \frac{2}{3},\]so the volume of its upper half is $\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{12}.$  Then the volume of the smaller octahedron is $\frac{2}{12} = \boxed{\frac{1}{6}}.$
Let $\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & a \\ 0 & 1 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  Then we can write $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I} + \mathbf{B},$ where
\[\mathbf{B} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 & a \\ 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.\]Note that
\[\mathbf{B}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 & a \\ 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 & a \\ 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 8 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\]and
\[\mathbf{B}^3 = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{B}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 & a \\ 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 8 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{0}.\]Then by the Binomial Theorem,
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^n &= (\mathbf{I} + \mathbf{B})^n \\
&= \mathbf{I}^n + \binom{n}{1} \mathbf{I}^{n - 1} \mathbf{B} + \binom{n}{2} \mathbf{I}^{n - 2} \mathbf{B}^2 + \binom{n}{3} \mathbf{I}^{n - 3} \mathbf{B}^3 + \dots + \mathbf{B}^n \\
&= \mathbf{I} + n \mathbf{B} + \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} \mathbf{B}^2 \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} + n \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 & a \\ 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 8 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2n & an + 4n(n - 1) \\ 0 & 1 & 4n \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}Hence, $2n = 18,$ $an + 4n(n - 1) = 2007,$ and $4n = 36.$  Solving, we find $a = 191$ and $n = 9,$ so $a + n = \boxed{200}.$
Note: We can expand $(\mathbf{I} + \mathbf{B})^{2016}$ using the Binomial Theorem because the matrices $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{I}$ commute, i.e
$\mathbf{B} \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{I} \mathbf{B}.$  In general, expanding a power of $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$ is difficult
For example,
\[(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B})^2 = \mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{A} \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{B} \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}^2,\]and without knowing more about $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B},$ this cannot be simplified.
From the equation $\cos x - 4 \sin x = 1,$
\[\cos x - 1 = 4 \sin x.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[\cos^2 x - 2 \cos x + 1 = 16 \sin^2 x = 16 - 16 \cos^2 x.\]This simplifies to $17 \cos^2 x - 2 \cos x - 15 = 0,$ which factors as
\[(\cos x - 1)(17 \cos x + 15) = 0.\]Hence, $\cos x = 1$ or $\cos x = -\frac{15}{17}.$
If $\cos x = 1,$ then $\sin x = \frac{\cos x - 1}{4} = 0,$ so
\[\sin x + 4 \cos x = 0 + 4(1) = \boxed{4}.\]If $\cos x = -\frac{15}{17},$ then $\sin x = \frac{\cos x - 1}{4} = -\frac{8}{17},$ so
\[\sin x + 4 \cos x = -\frac{8}{17} + 4 \left( -\frac{15}{17} \right) = \boxed{-4}.\]

The direction vectors of the planes are $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},$ so
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} = \boxed{\frac{11}{21}}.\]
Expanding the determinant, we obtain
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 4 & 9 \\ 3 & x & y \\ 3 & y & x \end{vmatrix} &= \begin{vmatrix} x & y \\ y & x \end{vmatrix} - 4 \begin{vmatrix} 3 & y \\ 3 & x \end{vmatrix} + 9 \begin{vmatrix} 3 & x \\ 3 & y \end{vmatrix} \\
&= (x^2 - y^2) - 4(3x - 3y) + 9(3y - 3x) \\
&= x^2 - y^2 - 39x + 39y \\
&= (x - y)(x + y) - 39(x - y) \\
&= (x - y)(x + y - 39).
\end{align*}Since this is 0, either $x - y = 0$ or $x + y - 39 = 0.$  But $x$ and $y$ are distinct, so $x + y = \boxed{39}.$
From the given equation,
\[\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = -\sqrt{3} \mathbf{c}.\]Then $(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) = 3 \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{c} = 3.$  Expanding, we get
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 3.\]Then $2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 1,$ so $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \frac{1}{2}.$
If $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b},$ then
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{1/2}{1 \cdot 1} = \frac{1}{2},\]so $\theta = \boxed{60^\circ}.$
The product of the matrices is
\[\begin{pmatrix} a & 2 \\ 1 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{2}{7} & \frac{1}{7} \\ b & \frac{3}{14} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2b - \frac{2a}{7} & \frac{a + 3}{7} \\ 4b - \frac{2}{7} & 1 \end{pmatrix}.\]We want this to be the identity matrix, so $2b - \frac{2a}{7} = 1,$ $\frac{a + 3}{7} = 0,$ and $4b - \frac{2}{7} = 0.$  Solving, we find $(a,b) = \boxed{\left( -3, \frac{1}{14} \right)}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
\frac{\tan \frac{\pi}{5} + i}{\tan \frac{\pi}{5} - i} &= \frac{\frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{5}}{\cos \frac{\pi}{5}} + i}{\frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{5}}{\cos \frac{\pi}{5}} - i} \\
&= \frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{5} + i \cos \frac{\pi}{5}}{\sin \frac{\pi}{5} - i \cos \frac{\pi}{5}} \\
&= \frac{i \sin \frac{\pi}{5} - \cos \frac{\pi}{5}}{i \sin \frac{\pi}{5} + \cos \frac{\pi}{5}} \\
&= \frac{\cos \frac{4 \pi}{5} + i \sin \frac{4 \pi}{5}}{\cos \frac{\pi}{5} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{5}} \\
&= \cos \frac{3 \pi}{5} + i \sin \frac{3 \pi}{5} \\
&= \cos \frac{6 \pi}{10} + i \sin \frac{6 \pi}{10}.
\end{align*}Thus, $n = \boxed{3}.$
Let $x = 2 \cos \alpha + 5 \sin \beta$ and $y = 2 \sin \alpha + 5 \cos \beta.$  Then
\begin{align*}
x^2 + y^2 &= (2 \cos \alpha + 5 \sin \beta)^2 + (2 \sin \alpha + 5 \cos \beta)^2 \\
&= 4 \cos^2 \alpha + 20 \cos \alpha \sin \beta + 25 \sin^2 \beta +  4 \sin^2 \alpha + 20 \sin \alpha \cos \beta + 25 \cos^2 \beta \\
&= 29 + 20 \cos \alpha \sin \beta + 20 \sin \alpha \cos \beta.
\end{align*}From the angle addition formula, this is equal to $29 + 20 \sin (\alpha + \beta),$ which is at most $29 + 20 = 49.$
In the coordinate plane, let $O = (0,0),$ $P = (8,15),$ and $Q = (x,y).$   Then by the Triangle Inequality,
\[OQ + PQ \ge OP,\]so $PQ \ge OP - OQ = 17 - \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \ge 10.$  Therefore,
\[(2 \cos \alpha + 5 \sin \beta - 8)^2 + (2 \sin \alpha + 5 \cos \beta - 15)^2 \ge 100.\]Equality occurs when $\alpha$ is the angle such that $\cos \alpha = \frac{8}{17}$ and $\sin \alpha = \frac{15}{17},$ and $\beta = 90^\circ - \alpha.$  Thus, the minimum value of the expression is $\boxed{100}.$
We compute the first few powers of $\mathbf{A}$:
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^2 &= \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1} = \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 & -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}, \\
\mathbf{A}^3 &= \mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^2 = \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 & -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}Then
\[\mathbf{A}^6 = \mathbf{A}^3 \mathbf{A}^3 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}\]and
\[\mathbf{A}^{12} = \mathbf{A}^6 \mathbf{A}^6 = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{I}.\]Therefore,
\[\mathbf{A}^{2018} = (\mathbf{A}^{12})^{168} \mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A}^2 = \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 & -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}.\]
Let $\mathbf{P}$ denote the given matrix, so $\mathbf{P} \mathbf{v}$ is the projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\ell.$  In particular, $\mathbf{P} \mathbf{v}$ lies on $\ell$ for any vector $\mathbf{v}.$  So, we can take $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{i}.$  Then
\[\mathbf{P} \mathbf{i} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{2}{15} \\ -\frac{1}{15} \\ -\frac{1}{3} \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{15} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, the direction vector we seek is $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}}.$
We have that $r = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-2 \sqrt{3})^2} = 4.$  We want $\theta$ to satisfy
\begin{align*}
-2 &= 4 \cos \theta, \\
-2 \sqrt{3} &= 4 \sin \theta.
\end{align*}Thus, $\theta = \frac{4 \pi}{3},$ so the cylindrical coordinates are $\boxed{\left( 4, \frac{4 \pi}{3}, -1 \right)}.$
Place the pyramid on a coordinate system with $A$ at $(0,0,0)$, $B$ at $(4,0,0)$, $C$ at $(4,4,0)$, $D$ at $(0,4,0)$ and with $E$ at $(2,2,2\sqrt{2})$
Let $R$, $S$, and $T$ be the midpoints of $\overline{AE}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CD}$ respectively

Note that $S = (4,2,0)$ and $T = (4,2,0)$ satisfy any equation of the form
\[x + y + kz = 6.\]Substituting $x = y = 1$ and $z = \sqrt{2},$ we get $2 + k \sqrt{2} = 6,$ so $k = 2 \sqrt{2}.$  Thus, the equation of plane $RST$ is
\[x + y + 2z \sqrt{2} = 6.\]Let $U$ and $V$ be the points of intersection of the plane with $\overline{BE}$ and $\overline{DE}$ respectively
Points on $\overline{BE}$ have coordinates of the form $(4-t, t, t\sqrt{2}).$  Substituting into the equation of the plane, we get
\[4 - t + t + 4t = 6.\]Then $t = \frac{1}{2},$ so $U = \left(\dfrac{7}{2},\dfrac{1}{2},\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right).$
Similarly, points on $\overline{DE}$ have coordinates of the form $(t,4-t,t\sqrt{2}).$  Substituting into the equation of the plane, we get
\[t + 4 - t + 4t = 6.\]Then $t = \frac{1}{2},$ so $V = \left(\dfrac{1}{2},\dfrac{7}{2},\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right).$
Then $RU=RV=\sqrt{7}$, $US=VT=\sqrt{3}$ and $ST = 2\sqrt{2}$
Note also that $UV = 3\sqrt{2}$
Thus the pentagon formed by the intersection of the plane and the pyramid can be partitioned into isosceles triangle $RUV$ and isosceles trapezoid $USTV.$

Dropping the altitude from $R$ to $\overline{UV}$ and applying Pythagoras, we find that the altitude of triangle $RUV$ is $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}.$  Therefore, the area of triangle $RUV$ is

Dropping the altitude from $V$ to $\overline{ST},$ we find that the altitude of trapezoid $USTV$ is $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}.$  Thus, the area of trapezoid $USTV$ is

We have that
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^2 &= \frac{1}{25} \begin{pmatrix} -3 & a \\ b & c \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -3 & a \\ b & c \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{1}{25} \begin{pmatrix} 9 + ab & -3a + ac \\ -3b + bc & ab + c^2 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}Thus, $9 + ab = ab + c^2 = 25$ and $-3a + ac = -3b + bc = 0.$
From $9 + ab = ab + c^2 = 25,$ $ab = 16$ and $c^2 = 9,$ so $c = \pm 3.$
If $c = -3,$ then $-6a = -6b = 0,$ so $a = b = 0.$  But then $ab = 0,$ contradiction, so $c = 3.$  Thus, any values of $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ such that $ab = 16$ and $c = 3$ work.
We want to maximize $a + b + c = a + \frac{16}{a} + 3.$  Since $a$ is an integer, $a$ must divide 16
We can then check that $a + \frac{16}{a} + 3$ is maximized when $a = 1$ or $a = 16,$ which gives a maximum value of $\boxed{20}.$
More generally, suppose we have a line $l$ that is reflect across line $l_1$ to obtain line $l'.$

label("$l'$", dir(10), E);
[/asy]
Also, suppose line $l$ makes angle $\theta$ with the $x$-axis, and line $l_1$ makes angle $\alpha$ with the $x$-axis
Then line $l'$ makes angle $2 \alpha - \theta$ with the $x$-axis
(This should make sense, because line $l_1$ is "half-way" between lines $l$ and $l',$ so the angle of line $l_1$ is the average of the angles of line $l$ and $l'$.)
So, if $l$ makes an angle of $\theta$ with the $x$-axis, then its reflection $l'$ across line $l_1$ makes an angle of
\[2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{70} - \theta = \frac{\pi}{35} - \theta\]with the $x$-axis.
Then the reflection of $l'$ across line $l_2$ makes an angle of
\[2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{54} - \left( \frac{\pi}{35} - \theta \right) = \theta + \frac{8 \pi}{945}\]with the $x$-axis.
Therefore, the line $R^{(n)}(l)$ makes an angle of
\[\theta + \frac{8 \pi}{945} \cdot n\]with the $x$-axis
For this line to coincide with the original line $l,$
\[\frac{8 \pi}{945} \cdot n\]must be an integer multiple of $2 \pi.$  The smallest such positive integer for which this happens is $n = \boxed{945}.$
The direction vectors of the lines are $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ -k \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} k \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  Suppose these vectors are proportional
Then comparing $y$-coordinates, we can get the second vector by multiplying the first vector by 2
But then $2 = k$ and $-2k = 1,$ which is not possible.
So the vectors cannot be proportional, which means that the lines cannot be parallel
Therefore, the only way that the lines can be coplanar is if they intersect.
Equating the representations for both lines, and comparing entries, we get
\begin{align*}
2 + t &= 1 + ku, \\
3 + t &= 4 + 2u, \\
4 - kt &= 5 + u.
\end{align*}Then $t = 2u + 1.$  Substituting into the first equation, we get $2u + 3 = 1 + ku,$ so $ku = 2u + 2.$
Substituting into the second equation, we get $4 - k(2u + 1) = 5 + u,$ so $2ku = -k - u - 1.$  Hence, $4u + 4 = -k - u - 1,$ so $k = -5u - 5.$  Then
\[(-5u - 5)u = 2u + 2,\]which simplifies to $5u^2 + 7u + 2 = 0.$  This factors as $(u + 1)(5u + 2) = 0,$ so $u = -1$ or $u = -\frac{2}{5}.$  This leads to the possible values $\boxed{0,-3}$ for $k.$
By sum-to-product,
\[\sin (a + b) - \sin (a - b) = \boxed{2 \sin b \cos a}.\]
The line can be parameterized by
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} + t \left( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ -3 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \begin{pmatrix} 2 - 3t \\ 3 - 6t \\ 4 - 7t \end{pmatrix}.\]Then the particle intersects the sphere when
\[(2 - 3t)^2 + (3 - 6t)^2 + (4 - 7t)^2 = 1.\]This simplifies to $94t^2 - 104t + 28 = 0.$  Let $t_1$ and $t_2$ be the roots, so by Vieta's formulas, $t_1 + t_2 = \frac{104}{94} = \frac{52}{47}$ and $t_1 t_2 = \frac{28}{94} = \frac{14}{47}.$  Then
\[(t_1 - t_2)^2 = (t_1 + t_2)^2 - 4t_1 t_2 = \frac{72}{2209},\]so $|t_1 - t_2| = \sqrt{\frac{72}{2209}} = \frac{6 \sqrt{2}}{47}.$
The two points of intersection are then $(2 - 3t_1, 3 - 6t_1, 4 - 7t_1)$ and $(2 - 3t_2, 3 - 6t_2, 4 - 7t_2),$ so the distance between them is
\[\sqrt{3^2 (t_1 - t_2)^2 + 6^2 (t_1 - t_2)^2 + 7^2 (t_1 - t_2)^2} = \sqrt{94} \cdot \frac{6 \sqrt{2}}{47} = \frac{12}{\sqrt{47}}.\]Thus, $a + b = 12 + 47 = \boxed{59}.$
Let $A = (-1,4),$ $B = (7,0),$ and $C = (11,5).$  Let $\mathbf{v} = \overrightarrow{CA} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 - 11 \\ 4 - 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{w} = \overrightarrow{CB} = \begin{pmatrix} 7 - 11 \\ 0 - 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}.$  The area of triangle $ABC$ is half the area of the parallelogram determined by $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}.$

The area of the parallelogram determined by $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ is
\[|(-12)(-5) - (-4)(-1)| = 56,\]so the area of triangle $ABC$ is $56/2 = \boxed{28}.$
The cross product of $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -1 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$ is
\[\begin{pmatrix} (0)(7) - (-1)(3) \\ (3)(5) - (7)(2) \\ (2)(-1) - (5)(0) \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We have that $\det (\mathbf{A}^3) = (\det \mathbf{A})^3 = \boxed{125}.$
The determinant $D$ is given by $\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}).$
Then the determinant of the matrix whose column vectors are $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b},$ $\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c},$ and $\mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}$ is given by
\[(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot ((\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) \times (\mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})).\]We can first expand the cross product:
\begin{align*}
(\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) \times (\mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) &= \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a} \\
&= \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}.
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot ((\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) \times (\mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})) &= (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) \\
&= \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) + \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) + \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) \\
&\quad + \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) + \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) + \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}).
\end{align*}Since $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}$ are orthogonal, their dot product is 0
Similarly, most of these dot products vanish, and we are left with
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}).\]By the scalar triple product, $\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) = D,$ so the determinant of the matrix whose column vectors are $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b},$ $\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c},$ and $\mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}$ is $\boxed{2D}.$
Since $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^n = \begin{pmatrix} F_{n + 1} & F_n \\ F_n & F_{n - 1} \end{pmatrix},$
\[\det \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^n = \det \begin{pmatrix} F_{n + 1} & F_n \\ F_n & F_{n - 1} \end{pmatrix}.\]Now,
\[\det \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^n = \left( \det \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \right)^n = (-1)^n,\]and
\[\det \begin{pmatrix} F_{n + 1} & F_n \\ F_n & F_{n - 1} \end{pmatrix} = F_{n + 1} F_{n - 1} - F_n^2,\]so
\[F_{n + 1} F_{n - 1} - F_n^2 = (-1)^n.\]In particular, taking $n = 785,$ we get $F_{784} F_{786} - F_{785}^2 = \boxed{-1}.$
Since $\cos \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},$ $\arccos \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{6}}.$
From $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0},$ we have $(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) \cdot (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = 0.$  Expanding, we get
\[\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{w} + 2 (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}) = 0.\]Note that $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = \|\mathbf{u}\|^2 = 9,$ $\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 = 16,$ and $\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{w} = \|\mathbf{w}\|^2 = 25,$ so
\[2 (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}) + 50 = 0.\]Therefore, $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w} = \boxed{-25}.$
Since $\angle APB = \angle BPC = \angle CPA,$ they are all equal to $120^\circ.$
Let $z = PC.$  By the Law of Cosines on triangles $BPC,$ $APB,$ and $APC,$
\begin{align*}
BC^2 &= z^2 + 6z + 36, \\
AB^2 &= 196, \\
AC^2 &= z^2 + 10z + 100.
\end{align*}By the Pythagorean Theorem, $AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2,$ so
\[196 + z^2 + 6z + 36 = z^2 + 10z + 100.\]Solving, we find $z = \boxed{33}.$
Suppose the curve intersects itself when $t = a$ and $t = b,$ so $a^2 - 2 = b^2 - 2$ and $a^3 - 9a + 5 = b^3 - 9b + 5.$  Then $a^2 = b^2,$ so $a = \pm b.$  We assume that $a \neq b,$ so $a = -b,$ or $b = -a.$  Then
\[a^3 - 9a + 5 = (-a)^3 - 9(-a) + 5 = -a^3 + 9a + 5,\]or $2a^3 - 18a = 0.$  This factors as $2a (a - 3)(a + 3) = 0.$
If $a = 0,$ then $b = 0,$ so we reject this solution
Otherwise, $a = \pm 3.$  For either value, $(x,y) = \boxed{(7,5)}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow{G}_A &= \frac{\overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C} + \overrightarrow{D}}{3}, \\
\overrightarrow{G}_B &= \frac{\overrightarrow{A} + \overrightarrow{C} + \overrightarrow{D}}{3}, \\
\overrightarrow{G}_C &= \frac{\overrightarrow{A} + \overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{D}}{3}, \\
\overrightarrow{G}_D &= \frac{\overrightarrow{A} + \overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C}}{3}.
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow{G_B G_A} &= \overrightarrow{G_A} - \overrightarrow{G_B} \\
&= \frac{\overrightarrow{B} + \overrightarrow{C} + \overrightarrow{D}}{3} - \frac{\overrightarrow{A} + \overrightarrow{C} + \overrightarrow{D}}{3} \\
&= \frac{1}{3} (\overrightarrow{B} - \overrightarrow{A}) \\
&= \frac{1}{3} \overrightarrow{AB}.
\end{align*}It follows that $\overline{G_B G_A}$ is parallel to $\overline{AB},$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ in length.
Similarly,
\[\overrightarrow{G_B G_C} = \frac{1}{3} \overrightarrow{CB}.\]It follows that $\overline{G_B G_C}$ is parallel to $\overline{BC},$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ in length
Therefore, triangles $ABC$ and $G_A G_B G_C$ are similar, and
\[[G_A G_B G_C] = \frac{1}{9} [ABC].\]In the same way, we can show that
\[[G_C G_D G_A] = \frac{1}{9} [CDA].\]Therefore, $[G_A G_B G_C G_C] = \frac{1}{9} [ABCD],$ so $\frac{[G_A G_B G_C G_D]}{[ABCD]} = \boxed{\frac{1}{9}}.$
Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}.$  Then from the given equation,
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 10x - 40y + 8z.\]Completing the square in $x,$ $y,$ and $z,$ we get
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 20)^2 + (z - 4)^2 = 441.\]This represents the equation of a sphere with radius 21, and its volume is
\[\frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 21^3 = \boxed{12348 \pi}.\]
By the Law of Cosines on triangle $ACD,$
\[\cos \angle ADC = \frac{3^2 + 8^2 - 7^2}{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 8} = \frac{1}{2},\]so $\angle ADC = 60^\circ.$

Then $\angle BDC = 120^\circ.$  Let $x = BD.$  Then by the Law of Cosines on triangle $BCD,$
\begin{align*}
49 &= 9 + x^2 - 6x \cos 120^\circ \\
&= x^2 + 3x + 9,
\end{align*}so $x^2 + 3x - 40 = 0.$  This factors as $(x - 5)(x + 8) = 0,$ so $x = \boxed{5}.$
Since $\begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3}{5} \\ -\frac{6}{5} \end{pmatrix}$ is the projection of $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}$ onto $\mathbf{a},$
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3}{5} \\ -\frac{6}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{18}{5} \\ -\frac{9}{5} \end{pmatrix}\]is orthogonal to $\mathbf{a}.$  But since $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are orthogonal, $\begin{pmatrix} \frac{18}{5} \\ -\frac{9}{5} \end{pmatrix}$ is a scalar multiple of $\mathbf{b}.$

Furthermore,
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} \frac{18}{5} \\ -\frac{9}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3}{5} \\ -\frac{6}{5} \end{pmatrix}\]is a scalar multiple of $\mathbf{a},$ and therefore orthogonal to $\mathbf{b}.$  Hence, $\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \frac{18}{5} \\ -\frac{9}{5} \end{pmatrix}}.$
The vector pointing from $(-1,1,1)$ to $(1,-1,1)$ is $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.$  Since the plane we are interested in is perpendicular to the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5,$ its normal vector must be orthogonal to $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}.$  But the normal vector of the plane is also orthogonal to $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.$  So, to find the normal vector of the plane we are interested in, we take the cross product of these vectors:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ -6 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.\]Scaling, we take $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector
Therefore, the equation of the plane is of the form
\[x + y - z + D = 0.\]Substituting the coordinates of $(-1,1,1),$ we find that the equation of the plane is $\boxed{x + y - z + 1 = 0}.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin x + \sin 2x}{1 + \cos x + \cos 2x} &= \frac{\sin x + 2 \sin x \cos x}{1 + \cos x + 2 \cos^2 x - 1} \\
&= \frac{\sin x + 2 \sin x \cos x}{\cos x + 2 \cos^2 x} \\
&= \frac{\sin x (1 + 2 \cos x)}{\cos x (1 + 2 \cos x)} \\
&= \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \boxed{\tan x}.
\end{align*}
Let $x = \sin^2 \theta$ and $y = \cos^2 \theta,$ so $x + y = 1.$  Also,
\[\frac{x^2}{a} + \frac{y^2}{b} = \frac{1}{a + b}.\]Substituting $y = 1 - x,$ we get
\[\frac{x^2}{a} + \frac{(1 - x)^2}{b} = \frac{1}{a + b}.\]This simplifies to
\[(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) x^2 - (2a^2 + 2ab) x + a^2 = 0,\]which nicely factors as $((a + b) x - a)^2 = 0.$  Hence, $(a + b)x - a = 0,$ so $x = \frac{a}{a + b}.$
Then $y = \frac{b}{a + b},$ so
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin^8 \theta}{a^3} + \frac{\cos^8 \theta}{b^3} &= \frac{x^4}{a^3} + \frac{y^4}{b^3} \\
&= \frac{a^4/(a + b)^4}{a^3} + \frac{b^4/(a + b)^4}{b^3} \\
&= \frac{a}{(a + b)^4} + \frac{b}{(a + b)^4} \\
&= \frac{a + b}{(a + b)^4} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{1}{(a + b)^3}}.
\end{align*}
Note $z^7 - 1 = \cos 4 \pi + i \sin 4 \pi - 1 = 0,$ so
\[(z - 1)(z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.\]Since $z \neq 1,$ $z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.$
\begin{align*}
\frac{z}{1 + z^2} + \frac{z^2}{1 + z^4} + \frac{z^3}{1 + z^6} &= \frac{z}{1 + z^2} + \frac{z^2}{1 + z^4} + \frac{z^3}{(1 + z^2)(1 - z^2 + z^4)} \\
&= \frac{z (1 + z^4)(1 - z^2 + z^4)}{(1 + z^4)(1 + z^6)} + \frac{z^2 (1 + z^6)}{(1 + z^4)(1 + z^6)} + \frac{(1 + z^4) z^3}{(1 + z^4)(1 + z^6)} \\
&= \frac{z^9 + z^8 + 2z^5 + z^2 + z}{(1 + z^4)(1 + z^6)} \\
&= \frac{z^2 + z + 2z^5 + z^2 + z}{1 + z^4 + z^6 + z^{10}} \\
&= \frac{2z^5 + 2z^2 + 2z}{z^6 + z^4 + z^3 + 1} \\
&= \frac{2(z^5 + z^2 + z)}{z^6 + z^4 + z^3 + 1}.
\end{align*}Since $z^7 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0,$ $z^5 + z^2 + z = -(z^6 + z^4 + z^3 + 1).$  Therefore, the given expression is equal to $\boxed{-2}.$
Let $S = \cos^6 0^\circ + \cos^6 1^\circ + \cos^6 2^\circ + \dots + \cos^6 90^\circ.$  Then

&= \sin^6 0^\circ + \sin^6 1^\circ + \sin^6 2^\circ + \dots + \sin^6 90^\circ.
\end{align*}Thus,
\[2S = \sum_{n = 0}^{90} (\cos^6 k^\circ + \sin^6 k^\circ).\]We have that
\begin{align*}
\cos^6 x + \sin^6 x &= (\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x)(\cos^4 x - \cos^2 x \sin^2 x + \sin^4 x) \\
&= \cos^4 x - \cos^2 x \sin^2 x + \sin^4 x \\
&= (\cos^4 x + 2 \cos^2 x \sin^2 x + \sin^4 x) - 3 \cos^2 x \sin^2 x \\
&= (\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x)^2 - 3 \cos^2 x \sin^2 x \\
&= 1 - \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 2x \\
&= 1 - \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1 - \cos 4x}{2} \\
&= \frac{5}{8} + \frac{3}{8} \cos 4x.
\end{align*}Hence,
\begin{align*}
2S &= \sum_{n = 0}^{90} \left( \frac{5}{8} + \frac{3}{8} \cos 4x \right) \\
&= \frac{455}{8} + \frac{3}{8} (\cos 0^\circ + \cos 4^\circ + \cos 8^\circ + \dots + \cos 356^\circ + \cos 360^\circ).
\end{align*}In $\cos 0^\circ + \cos 4^\circ + \cos 8^\circ + \dots + \cos 356^\circ + \cos 360^\circ,$ we can pair $\cos k^\circ$ with $\cos (k^\circ + 180^\circ),$ for $k = 0,$ $4,$ $8,$ $\dots,$ $176,$ and we are left with $\cos 360^\circ = 1.$  Therefore,
\[2S = \frac{455}{8} + \frac{3}{8} = \frac{229}{4},\]so $S = \boxed{\frac{229}{8}}.$
We have that
\[\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\ ac + cd & bc + d^2 \end{pmatrix},\]so $a^2 + bc = bc + d^2 = 7$ and $ab + bd = ac + cd = 0.$  Then $b(a + d) = c(a + d) = 0.$  Since $b$ and $c$ are nonzero, $a + d = 0.$
If $|a| = |d| = 1,$ then
\[bc = 7 - a^2 = 6.\]To minimize $|a| + |b| + |c| + |d| = |b| + |c| + 2,$ we take $b = 2$ and $c = 3,$ so $|a| + |b| + |c| + |d| = 7.$
If $|a| = |d| = 2,$ then
\[bc = 7 - a^2 = 3.\]Then $|b|$ and $|c|$ must be equal to 1 and 3 in some order, so $|a| + |b| + |c| + |d| = 8.$
If $|a| = |d| \ge 3,$ then $|a| + |b| + |c| + |d| \ge 8.$
Therefore, the minimum value of $|a| + |b| + |c| + |d|$ is $\boxed{7}.$
Let the line be
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{a} + t \mathbf{d}.\]Then from the given information,
\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 8 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{d}, \\
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -2 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{d}.
\end{align*}We can treat this system as a linear set of equations in $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{d}.$  Accordingly, we can solve to get $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 2/3 \\ 4/3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} -1/3 \\ -5/3 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.$  Hence,
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2/3 \\ 4/3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} -1/3 \\ -5/3 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.\]Taking $t = 3,$ we get
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2/3 \\ 4/3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} + 3 \begin{pmatrix} -1/3 \\ -5/3 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -1/3 \\ -11/3 \\ -8 \end{pmatrix}}.\]

By the Angle Bisector Theorem, $\frac{BD}{AB} = \frac{CD}{AC},$ so $\frac{BD}{3} = \frac{CD}{6}.$  Also, $BD + CD = \frac{9}{\sqrt{2}},$ so $BD = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $CD = \frac{6}{\sqrt{2}}.$
By the Law of Cosines on triangle $ABC,$
\[\cos B = \frac{9 + \frac{81}{2} - 36}{2 \cdot 3\cdot \frac{9}{\sqrt{2}}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}.\]Then by the Law of Cosines on triangle $ABD,$

By Pythagoras on right triangle $ABD,$

\begin{align*}
AD^2 &= AC^2 - CD^2, \\

\begin{align*}

We see that
\[\begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{3} & -1 \\ 1 & \sqrt{3} \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{3}/2 & -1/2 \\ 1/2 & \sqrt{3}/2 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} \cos \frac{\pi}{6} & -\sin \frac{\pi}{6} \\ \sin \frac{\pi}{6} & \cos \frac{\pi}{6} \end{pmatrix}.\]Note that $\begin{pmatrix} \cos \frac{\pi}{6} & -\sin \frac{\pi}{6} \\ \sin \frac{\pi}{6} & \cos \frac{\pi}{6} \end{pmatrix}$ corresponds to a rotation of $\frac{\pi}{6}$ around the origin.
In general, for a rotation matrix,
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta\\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta
\end{pmatrix}^k = \begin{pmatrix} \cos k\theta & -\sin k\theta \\
\sin k\theta & \cos k\theta
\end{pmatrix}.
$$Hence,
\begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{3} & -1 \\ 1 & \sqrt{3} \end{pmatrix}^6 = 2^6 \begin{pmatrix} \cos \frac{\pi}{6} & -\sin \frac{\pi}{6} \\ \sin \frac{\pi}{6} & \cos \frac{\pi}{6} \end{pmatrix}^6 = 2^6 \begin{pmatrix} \cos {\pi} & -\sin {\pi} \\ \sin {\pi} & \cos {\pi}\end{pmatrix} = \boxed{ \begin{pmatrix} -64 & 0 \\ 0 & -64 \end{pmatrix} }.
First, we have that $\cos \frac{7 \pi}{8} = -\cos \frac{\pi}{8}$ and $\cos \frac{5 \pi}{8} = -\cos \frac{3 \pi}{8},$ so
\begin{align*}
\left( 1 + \cos \frac {\pi}{8} \right) \left( 1 + \cos \frac {3 \pi}{8} \right) \left( 1 + \cos \frac {5 \pi}{8} \right) \left( 1 + \cos \frac {7 \pi}{8} \right) &= \left( 1 + \cos \frac {\pi}{8} \right) \left( 1 + \cos \frac {3 \pi}{8} \right) \left( 1 - \cos \frac {3 \pi}{8} \right) \left( 1 - \cos \frac {\pi}{8} \right) \\
&= \left( 1 - \cos^2 \frac{\pi}{8} \right) \left( 1 - \cos^2 \frac{3 \pi}{8} \right) \\
&= \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{8} \sin^2 \frac{3 \pi}{8} \\
&= \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{8} \cos^2 \frac{\pi}{8}.
\end{align*}By the double angle formula,
\[2 \sin \frac{\pi}{8} \cos \frac{\pi}{8} = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\]so $\sin^2 \frac{\pi}{8} \cos^2 \frac{\pi}{8} = \left( \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \boxed{\frac{1}{8}}.$
We can translate the solutions, to obtain the equation $z^8 = 81 = 3^4.$  Thus, the solutions are of the form
\[z = \sqrt{3} \operatorname{cis} \frac{2 \pi k}{8},\]where $0 \le k \le 7.$  The solutions are equally spaced on the circle with radius $\sqrt{3},$ forming an octagon.
unitsize(1 cm);
int i;
draw(Circle((0,0),sqrt(3)));
draw((-2,0)--(2,0));
draw((0,-2)--(0,2));
for (i = 0; i <= 7; ++i) {
dot(sqrt(3)*dir(45*i));
draw(sqrt(3)*dir(45*i)--sqrt(3)*dir(45*(i + 1)));
label("$\sqrt{3}$", (sqrt(3)/2,0), S);
[/asy]
We obtain the triangle with minimal area when the vertices are as close as possible to each other, so we take consecutive vertices of the octagon
Thus, we can take $\left( \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} \right),$ $(\sqrt{3},0),$ and $\left( \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} \right).$
unitsize(1 cm);
int i;
pair A, B, C;
A = (sqrt(6)/2,sqrt(6)/2);
B = (sqrt(3),0);
C = (sqrt(6)/2,-sqrt(6)/2);
fill(A--B--C--cycle,gray(0.7));
draw(Circle((0,0),sqrt(3)));
draw((-2,0)--(2,0));
draw((0,-2)--(0,2));

label("$(\sqrt{3},0)$", B, NE);
label("$(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2})$", C, C);
[/asy]
The triangle has base $\sqrt{6}$ and height $\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2},$ so its area is
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{6} \cdot \left( \sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} \right) = \boxed{\frac{3 \sqrt{2} - 3}{2}}.\]
Let $A = (\alpha,0,0),$ $B = (0,\beta,0),$ and $C = (0,0,\gamma).$  Since $(p,q,r)$ is equidistant from $O,$ $A,$ $B,$ and $C,$
\begin{align*}
p^2 + q^2 + r^2 &= (p - \alpha)^2 + q^2 + r^2, \\
p^2 + q^2 + r^2 &= p^2 + (q - \beta)^2 + r^2, \\
p^2 + q^2 + r^2 &= p^2 + q^2 + (r - \gamma)^2.
\end{align*}The first equation simplifies to $2 \alpha p = \alpha^2.$  Since $\alpha \neq 0,$
\[\alpha = 2p.\]Similarly, $\beta = 2q$ and $\gamma = 2r.$
Since $A = (\alpha,0,0),$ $B = (0,\beta,0),$ and $C = (0,0,\gamma),$ the equation of plane $ABC$ is given by
\[\frac{x}{\alpha} + \frac{y}{\beta} + \frac{z}{\gamma} = 1.\]We can also write the equation of the plane as
\[\frac{x}{2p} + \frac{y}{2q} + \frac{z}{2r} = 1.\]Since $(a,b,c)$ lies on this plane,
\[\frac{a}{2p} + \frac{b}{2q} + \frac{c}{2r} = 1,\]so
\[\frac{a}{p} + \frac{b}{q} + \frac{c}{r} = \boxed{2}.\]
We have $\sin\theta = \cos(90^\circ - \theta),$ so
$$\cos \theta - \sin\theta = \cos\theta -\cos(90^\circ-\theta).$$Applying the difference of cosines formula gives
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta - \cos(90^\circ - \theta) &= 2\sin\frac{\theta + (90^\circ - \theta)}{2}\sin\frac{(90^\circ-\theta) - \theta}{2} \\
&= 2\sin45^\circ\sin\frac{90^\circ - 2\theta}{2} \\
&= \sqrt{2}\sin\frac{90^\circ - 2\theta}{2}.
\end{align*}We have $\sqrt{2}\sin10^\circ = \sqrt{2}\sin\frac{90^\circ - 2\theta}{2}$ when $10^\circ = \frac{90^\circ - 2\theta}{2}.$ Therefore, $90^\circ - 2\theta = 20^\circ$, and $\theta = \boxed{35^\circ}.$
Although $\sin 10^\circ = \sin 170^\circ = \sin (-190^\circ)$ etc., because $\theta$ is acute, $-45^\circ < \frac{90^\circ - 2\theta}{2} < 45^\circ$ and so none of these other possibilities result in an acute $\theta$.
The dilation centered at the origin with scale factor $-3$ takes $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ to $\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ to $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix},$ so the matrix is
\[\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -3 & 0 \\ 0 & -3 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We see that the graph reaches a maximum at $x = 0.$  The graph of $y = \sin x$ first reaches a maximum at $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$ for positive values of $x,$ so $c = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{2}}.$
Let $x = 2^{\cos \theta}.$  Then the given equation becomes
\[2^{-\frac{3}{2}} x^2 + 1 = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} x.\]We can re-write this as
\[2^{-\frac{3}{2}} x^2 - 2^{\frac{1}{4}} x + 1 = 0.\]Since $2^{-\frac{3}{2}} = (2^{-\frac{3}{4}})^2$ and $2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2 \cdot 2^{-\frac{3}{4}},$ this quadratic factors as
\[(2^{-\frac{3}{4}} x - 1)^2 = 0.\]Then $2^{-\frac{3}{4}} x = 1,$ so $x = 2^{\frac{3}{4}}.$  Hence,
\[\cos \theta = \frac{3}{4},\]so $\cos 2 \theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1 = 2 \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^2 - 1 = \boxed{\frac{1}{8}}.$
From $\mathbf{A}^T = \mathbf{A}^{-1},$ $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}.$  Hence,
\[\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & c \\ b & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.\]Then $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ and $c^2 + d^2 = 1,$ so $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = \boxed{2}.$
For the vectors $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}$ to be orthogonal, their dot product should be 0:
\[(2)(x) + (5)(-3) = 0.\]Solving, we find $x = \boxed{\frac{15}{2}}.$
By the vector triple product, for any vectors $\mathbf{p},$ $\mathbf{q},$ and $\mathbf{r},$
\[\mathbf{p} \times (\mathbf{q} \times \mathbf{r}) = (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{r}) \mathbf{q} - (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q}) \mathbf{r}.\]Thus, $(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{c} = -\mathbf{c} \times (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) =  - (\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{a} + (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{b}.$  Hence,
\[(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{a} = \frac{1}{3} \|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{c}\| \mathbf{a}.\]Then
\[(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{b} = \left( \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \frac{1}{3} \|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{c}\| \right) \mathbf{a}.\]Since the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are not parallel, the only way that the equation above can hold is if both sides are equal to the zero vector
Hence,
\[\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \frac{1}{3} \|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{c}\| = 0.\]Since $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} = \|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{c}\| \cos \theta,$
\[\|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{c}\| \cos \theta + \frac{1}{3} \|\mathbf{b}\| \|\mathbf{c}\| = 0.\]Since $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{c}$ are nonzero, it follows that $\cos \theta = -\frac{1}{3}.$  Then
\[\sin \theta = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \boxed{\frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{3}}.\]
Since $\begin{vmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{vmatrix} = 4,$ $ad - bc = 4.$  Then
\[\begin{vmatrix} a & 7a + 3b \\ c & 7c  +3d \end{vmatrix} = a(7c + 3d) - (7a + 3b)c = 3ad - 3bc = 3(ad - bc) = \boxed{12}.\]
Consider a right triangle where the opposite side is 2 and the hypotenuse is 3.

label("$2$", (sqrt(5),1), E);
label("$\theta$", (0.7,0.3));
[/asy]
Then $\sin \theta = \frac{2}{3},$ so $\theta = \arcsin \frac{2}{3}.$  By Pythagoras, the adjacent side is $\sqrt{5},$ so $\cos \theta = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}}.$
Let $\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i \end{pmatrix}.$  Then
\[\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -3 & 4 & 0 \\ 5 & -7 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5b - 3a & 4a - 7b & c \\ 5e - 3d & 4d - 7e & f \\ 5h - 3g & 4g - 7h & i \end{pmatrix}.\]We want this to equal $\mathbf{I},$ so $c = f = 0$ and $i = 1.$  Also, $5h - 3g = 4g - 7h = 0,$ which forces $g = 0$ and $h = 0.$
Note that the remaining part of the matrix can be expressed as the product of two $2 \times 2$ matrices:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 5b - 3a & 4a - 7b \\ 5e - 3d & 4d - 7e \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ d & e \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -3 & 4 \\ 5 & -7 \end{pmatrix}.\]We want this to equal $\mathbf{I},$ so $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ d & e \end{pmatrix}$ is the inverse of $\begin{pmatrix} -3 & 4 \\ 5 & -7 \end{pmatrix},$ which is $\begin{pmatrix} -7 & -4 \\ -5 & -3 \end{pmatrix}.$  Therefore,
\[\mathbf{M} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -7 & -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -3 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Let $S = \cos^2 0^\circ + \cos^2 1^\circ + \cos^2 2^\circ + \dots + \cos^2 90^\circ.$  Then
\begin{align*}
S &= \cos^2 0^\circ + \cos^2 1^\circ + \cos^2 2^\circ + \dots + \cos^2 90^\circ \\
&= \cos^2 90^\circ + \cos^2 89^\circ + \cos^2 88^\circ + \dots + \cos^2 0^\circ \\
&= \sin^2 0^\circ + \sin^2 1^\circ + \sin^2 2^\circ + \dots + \sin^2 90^\circ,
\end{align*}so
\begin{align*}
2S &= (\cos^2 0^\circ + \sin^2 0^\circ) + (\cos^2 1^\circ + \sin^2 1^\circ) + (\cos^2 2^\circ + \sin^2 2^\circ) + \dots + (\cos^2 90^\circ + \sin^2 90^\circ) \\
&= 91,
\end{align*}which means $S = \boxed{\frac{91}{2}}.$
A point on the line is given by
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 7 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3t + 6 \\ 2t + 7 \\ -2t + 7 \end{pmatrix}.\][asy]

The vector pointing from $(1,2,3)$ to $(3t + 6, 2t + 7, -2t + 7)$ is then
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3t + 5 \\ 2t + 5 \\ -2t + 4 \end{pmatrix}.\]For the point on the line that is closest to $(1,2,3),$ this vector will be orthogonal to the direction vector of the second line, which is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.$  Thus,
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3t + 5 \\ 2t + 5 \\ -2t + 4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = 0.\]This gives us $(3t + 5)(3) + (2t + 5)(2) + (-2t + 4)(-2) = 0.$  Solving, we find $t = -1.$
The distance from the point to the line is then
\[\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \boxed{7}.\]
We can write
\begin{align*}
\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|^2 &= (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \\
&= \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} - 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} \\
&= \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 \\
&= 2 - 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}.
\end{align*}Similarly, $\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{c}\|^2 = 2 - 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}$ and $\|\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{c}\|^2 = 2 - 2 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c},$ so
\[\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{c}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{c}\|^2 = 6 - 2 (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}).\]Now,
\[\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}\|^2 \ge 0.\]We can expand this as
\[\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{c}\|^2 + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} \ge 0.\]Then $2 (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \ge -3,$ so
\[\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{c}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{c}\|^2 = 6 - 2 (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \le 9.\]Equality occurs when $\mathbf{a},$ $\mathbf{b},$ and $\mathbf{c}$ are equally spaced on a circle with radius 1 (where $\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{c}\| = \|\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{c}\| = \sqrt{3}$), so the largest possible value is $\boxed{9}.$

The graph of $y=\cos \frac{x}{2}$ passes through one full period as $\frac{x}{2}$ ranges from $0$ to $2\pi,$ which means $x$ ranges from $0$ to $\boxed{4 \pi}.$
The graph of $y=\cos \frac{x}{2}$ is shown below:

From (ii), (iii), and (iv),
\[T \left( \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 6 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \\ 8 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 8 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.\]This reduces to
\[T \begin{pmatrix} 27 \\ -54 \\ 54 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -63 \\ 36 \\ 36 \end{pmatrix}.\]In particular, from (i), $T (a \mathbf{v}) = a T(\mathbf{v}).$  Thus, we can divide both vectors by 9, to get
\[T \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -6 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 4 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.\]Now, we can try to express $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 9 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix}$ as the following linear combination:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 9 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix} = a \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 6 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} + b \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + c \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -6 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6a - 6b + 3c \\ 6a + 3b - 6c \\ 3a + 6b + 6c \end{pmatrix}.\]Solving $6a - 6b + 3c = 3,$ $6a + 3b - 6c = 9,$ and $3a + 6b + 6c = 12,$ we obtain $a = \frac{4}{3},$ $b = 1,$ and $c = \frac{1}{3}.$  Thus,
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 9 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{4}{3} \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 6 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + \frac{1}{3} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -6 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.\]Then by (i),
\[T \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 9 \\ 12 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{4}{3} \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \\ 8 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 8 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + \frac{1}{3} \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 4 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 8 \\ 11 \end{pmatrix}}.\]With more work, it can be shown that
\[T \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{7}{27} & \frac{26}{27} & -\frac{2}{27} \\ -\frac{14}{27} & -\frac{2}{27} & \frac{23}{27} \\ \frac{22}{27} & \frac{7}{27} & \frac{14}{27} \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}.\]With even more work, it can be shown that $T$ is a rotation in space.
The direction vector of the line is given by
\[\begin{pmatrix} 5 - 2 \\ 1 - 2 \\ -2 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix},\]so the line is parameterized by
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ - 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 3t \\  2 - t \\ 1 - 3t \end{pmatrix}.\]We want the $x$-coordinate to be 4, so $2 + 3t = 4.$  Solving, we find $t = \frac{2}{3}.$  Then the $z$-coordinate is $1 - 3t = \boxed{-1}.$
Let's locate these numbers in the complex plane before adding them
Since $e^{i \theta}$ is the terminal point for angle $\theta$ on the unit circle, here are the numbers:
size(200);
import TrigMacros;
rr_cartesian_axes(-2,2,-1,3,complexplane=true, usegrid = false);
pair O = (0,0);
pair[] Z;
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
Z[i] = dir(30i)*dir(12);
draw(O--Z[i]);
dot(Z[i]);
label("$e^{7\pi i/60}$", Z[0], dir(Z[0]));
label("$e^{17\pi i/60}$", Z[1], dir(Z[1]));
label("$e^{27\pi i/60}$", Z[2], dir(Z[2]));
label("$e^{37\pi i/60}$", Z[3], NNW);
label("$e^{47\pi i/60}$", Z[4], NW);
[/asy] We need to add all $5$ numbers
However, we don't actually need to find the exponential form of the answer: we just need to know argument of our sum, that is, the angle that our sum makes with the positive $x$-axis.
The symmetry of the above picture suggest that we consider what happens if we add up pairs of numbers
For example, let's try adding $e^{7\pi i/60}$ and $e^{47\pi i /60}$ head to tail:
size(200);
import TrigMacros;
rr_cartesian_axes(-2,2,-1,3,complexplane=true, usegrid = false);
pair O = (0,0);
pair[] Z;
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
Z[i] = dir(30i)*dir(12);
draw(O--Z[0], blue);
draw(O--Z[4]);
draw(Z[4]--Z[0]+Z[4], blue);
draw(O--Z[0]+Z[4]);
dot("$e^{7\pi i/60}$", Z[0], dir(Z[0]));
dot("$e^{47\pi i/60}$", Z[4], NW);
dot("$e^{7\pi i/60} + e^{47\pi i/60}$", Z[4]+Z[0], N);
[/asy]
Since $|e^{7\pi i/60}| = |e^{47\pi i/60}| = 1$, the parallelogram with vertices at $0, e^{7\pi i/60}, e^{47 \pi i/60}$ and $e^{7\pi i/ 60} + e^{47 \pi i/60}$ is a rhombus
That means that the line segment from $0$ to $e^{7\pi i/ 60} + e^{47 \pi i/60}$  splits the angle at $0$ in half, which means that the argument of $e^{7\pi i/60} + e^{47 \pi i/60}$ is the average of the arguments of the numbers being added, or in other words is
\[\dfrac{1}{2} \left( \dfrac{7\pi}{60} + \dfrac{47\pi}{60}\right) = \dfrac{27 \pi}{60} = \dfrac{9\pi}{20}.\]That means that
\[ e^{7\pi i/ 60} + e^{47 \pi i/60} = r_1 e^{9 \pi i/20},\]for some nonnegative $r_1$.
Similarly, we can consider the sum $e^{17\pi i/60} + e^{37\pi i/60}$
Here it is in the picture:
size(200);
import TrigMacros;
rr_cartesian_axes(-2,2,-1,3,complexplane=true, usegrid = false);
pair O = (0,0);
pair[] Z;
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
Z[i] = dir(30i)*dir(12);
draw(O--Z[1], blue);
draw(O--Z[3]);
draw(Z[3]--Z[1]+Z[3], blue);
draw(O--Z[1]+Z[3]);
dot("$e^{17\pi i/60}$", Z[1], dir(Z[1]));
dot("$e^{37\pi i/60}$", Z[3], NW);
dot("$e^{17\pi i/60} + e^{37\pi i/60}$", Z[3]+Z[1], N);
[/asy]We again have a rhombus, which again means that the sum of the pair has an argument equal to the average of the arguments
That means that the argument of $e^{17\pi i/60} + e^{37 \pi i/60}$ is the average of the arguments of the numbers being added, or in other words is
\[\dfrac{1}{2} \left( \dfrac{17\pi}{60} + \dfrac{37\pi}{60}\right) = \dfrac{27 \pi}{60} = \dfrac{9\pi}{20}.\]Therefore,
\[ e^{17\pi i/ 60} + e^{37 \pi i/60} = r_2 e^{9 \pi i/20},\]for some nonnegative $r_2$.
Finally, our middle number is $e^{27\pi i/60} = e^{9\pi i/20}$, simplifying the fraction
Now we're adding up three numbers with argument $e^{9\pi i/20}$, which gives another number with the same argument
To be more precise, we have that
\begin{align*}
e^{7\pi i/60} + e^{17\pi i/60} + e^{27 \pi i/60} + e^{37\pi i /60} + e^{47 \pi i /60} &= (e^{7\pi i/60} + e^{47\pi i/60}) + e^{27 \pi i/60} + (e^{37\pi i /60} + e^{47 \pi i /60})  \\
&= r_1 e^{9\pi i/20} + e^{9\pi i/20} + r_2 e^{9\pi i/20} \\
&= (r_1 +r_2 + 1) e^{9\pi i/20},
\end{align*}which gives that the argument of our sum is $\boxed{\dfrac{9\pi}{20}}$.
We have that
\begin{align*}
x &= \rho \sin \frac{2 \pi}{9} \cos \frac{8 \pi}{7}, \\
y &= \rho \sin \frac{2 \pi}{9} \sin \frac{8 \pi}{7}, \\
z &= \rho \cos \frac{2 \pi}{9}.
\end{align*}We want to negate the $z$-coordinate
We can accomplish this by replacing $\frac{2 \pi}{9}$ with $\pi - \frac{2 \pi}{9} = \frac{7 \pi}{9}$:
\begin{align*}
\rho \sin \frac{7 \pi}{9} \cos \frac{8 \pi}{7} &= \rho \sin \frac{2 \pi}{9} \cos \frac{8 \pi}{7} = x, \\
\rho \sin \frac{7 \pi}{9} \sin \frac{8 \pi}{7} &= \rho \sin \frac{2 \pi}{9} \sin \frac{8 \pi}{7} = y, \\
\rho \cos \frac{7 \pi}{9} &= -\rho \cos \frac{2 \pi}{9} = -z.
\end{align*}Thus, the spherical coordinates of $(x,y,z)$ are $\boxed{\left( 2, \frac{8 \pi}{7}, \frac{7 \pi}{9} \right)}.$
Note that $(\mathbf{A}^{-1})^2 \mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I},$ so the inverse of $\mathbf{A}^2$ is
\[(\mathbf{A}^{-1})^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 5 \\ -1 & -3 \end{pmatrix}^2 = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -5 \\ 1 & 4 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We have that $r = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-2)^2} = 2 \sqrt{2}.$  Also, if we draw the line connecting the origin and $(-2,2),$ this line makes an angle of $\frac{5 \pi}{4}$ with the positive $x$-axis.
unitsize(0.8 cm);
draw((-3.5,0)--(3.5,0));
draw((0,-3.5)--(0,3.5));
draw(arc((0,0),2*sqrt(2),0,225),red,Arrow(6));
draw((0,0)--(-2,-2));
dot((-2,-2), red);
label("$(-2,-2)$", (-2,-2), SE, UnFill);
dot((2*sqrt(2),0), red);
[/asy]
Therefore, the polar coordinates are $\boxed{\left( 2 \sqrt{2}, \frac{5 \pi}{4} \right)}.$
Note that the perpendicular bisectors meet at $O,$ the circumcenter of triangle $ABC.$

O = (0,0);

As usual, let $a = BC,$ $b = AC,$ and $c = AB.$  In triangle $OAB',$ taking $\overline{OB'}$ as the base, the height is $\frac{b}{2},$ so
\[[OAB'] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot R \cdot \frac{b}{2} = \frac{bR}{4}.\]Similarly, $[OCB'] = \frac{bR}{4},$ so $[OAB'C] = \frac{bR}{2}.$
Similarly, $[OCA'B] = \frac{aR}{2}$ and $[OBC'A] = \frac{cR}{2},$ so
\[[AB'CA'BC'] = [OCA'B] + [OAB'C] + [OBC'A] = \frac{aR}{2} + \frac{bR}{2} + \frac{cR}{2} = \frac{(a + b + c)R}{2} = \frac{35 \cdot 8}{2} = \boxed{140}.\]
From the given equation,
\[\arccos 2x = \arccos x + \frac{\pi}{3}.\]Then
\[\cos (\arccos 2x) = \cos \left( \arccos x + \frac{\pi}{3} \right).\]Hence, from the angle addition formula,
\begin{align*}
2x &= \cos (\arccos x) \cos \frac{\pi}{3} - \sin (\arccos x) \sin \frac{\pi}{3} \\
&= \frac{x}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sqrt{1 - x^2},
\end{align*}so
\[-3x = \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2}.\]Squaring both sides, we get $9x^2 = 3 - 3x^2.$  Then $12x^2 = 3,$ so $x^2 = \frac{1}{4},$ and $x = \pm \frac{1}{2}.$  Checking, we find only $x = \boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}$ works.
We have that
\begin{align*}
\frac{\tan^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ}{\tan^2 20^\circ \sin^2 20^\circ} &= \frac{\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} - \sin^2 20^\circ}{\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} \cdot \sin^2 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ - \cos^2 20^\circ \sin^2 20^\circ}{\sin^4 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{1 - \cos^2 20^\circ}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
We have that
\[\tan 2x = \frac{b}{a + b} = \frac{1}{\frac{a}{b} + 1} = \frac{1}{\tan x + 1},\]so $(\tan x + 1) \tan 2x = 1.$  Then from the double angle formula,
\[(\tan x + 1) \cdot \frac{2 \tan x}{1 - \tan^2 x} = 1,\]so $2 \tan x (\tan x + 1) = 1 - \tan^2 x,$ or
\[2 \tan x (\tan x + 1) + \tan^2 x - 1 = 0.\]We can factor as
\[2 \tan x (\tan x + 1) + (\tan x + 1)(\tan x - 1) = (\tan x + 1)(3 \tan x - 1) = 0.\]Thus, $\tan x = -1$ or $\tan x = \frac{1}{3}.$  The smallest positive solution is then $\tan^{-1} \frac{1}{3},$ so $k = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}.$
The curve describes a semicircle with radius 2
Therefore, the length of the curve is
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \pi \cdot 2 = \boxed{2 \pi}.\][asy]

By the vector triple product, for any vectors $\mathbf{u},$ $\mathbf{v},$ and $\mathbf{w},$
\[\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}) = (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w}) \mathbf{v} - (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{w}.\]Thus,
\[(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{a} - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a}) \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} = 0.\]Since $\|\mathbf{a}\| = 1,$
\[(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} = 0,\]so $(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{c} = -\mathbf{b}.$  Then
\[\|(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{c}\| = \|-\mathbf{b}\| = 1.\]We can then say $\|(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{c}\|^2 = 1,$ which expands as
\[(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c})^2 \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - 2 (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c})^2 + \|\mathbf{c}\|^2 = 1.\]We can simplify this to
\[-(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c})^2 + 4 = 1,\]so $(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c})^2 = 3.$  Hence, $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} = \pm \sqrt{3}.$
If $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{c},$ then
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{c}\|} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.\]The smallest possible angle $\theta$ satisfying this equation is $30^\circ.$  We can achieve $\boxed{30^\circ}$ by taking $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},$ and $\mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{3} \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},$ so this is the smallest possible angle.
Let $z = r (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta).$  Then
\[\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{r (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)} = \frac{1}{r} (\cos (-\theta) + i \sin (-\theta)) = \frac{1}{r} (\cos \theta - i \sin \theta).\]By the shoelace formula, the area of the triangle formed by 0, $z = r \cos \theta + ir \sin \theta$ and $\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{r} \cos \theta - \frac{i}{r} \sin \theta$ is
\[\frac{1}{2} \left| (r \cos \theta) \left( -\frac{1}{r} \sin \theta \right) - (r \sin \theta) \left( \frac{1}{r} \cos \theta \right) \right| = |\sin \theta \cos \theta|,\]so the area of the parallelogram is
\[2 |\sin \theta \cos \theta| = |\sin 2 \theta|.\]Thus, $|\sin 2 \theta| = \frac{35}{37}.$
We want to find the smallest possible value of
\begin{align*}
\left| z + \frac{1}{z} \right| &= \left| r \cos \theta + ir \sin \theta + \frac{1}{r} \cos \theta - \frac{i}{r} \sin \theta \right| \\
&= \left| r \cos \theta + \frac{1}{r} \cos \theta + i \left( r \sin \theta - \frac{1}{r} \sin \theta \right) \right|.
\end{align*}The square of this magnitude is
\begin{align*}
\left( r \cos \theta + \frac{1}{r} \cos \theta \right)^2 + \left( r \sin \theta - \frac{1}{r} \sin \theta \right)^2 &= r^2 \cos^2 \theta + 2 \cos^2 \theta + \frac{1}{r} \cos^2 \theta + r^2 \sin^2 \theta - 2 \sin^2 \theta + \frac{1}{r^2} \sin^2 \theta \\
&= r^2 + \frac{1}{r^2} + 2 (\cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta) \\
&= r^2 + \frac{1}{r^2} + 2 \cos 2 \theta.
\end{align*}By AM-GM, $r^2 + \frac{1}{r^2} \ge 2.$  Also,
\[\cos^2 2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 2 \theta = 1 - \left( \frac{35}{37} \right)^2 = \frac{144}{1369},\]so $\cos 2 \theta = \pm \frac{12}{37}.$
To minimize the expression above, we take $\cos 2 \theta = -\frac{12}{37},$ so
\[d^2 = 2 - 2 \cdot \frac{12}{37} = \boxed{\frac{50}{37}}.\]
Let $\mathbf{a}$ denote $\overrightarrow{A},$ etc
\[\mathbf{g} = \frac{\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}}{3},\]so
\begin{align*}
GA^2 &= \|\mathbf{g} - \mathbf{a}\|^2 \\
&= \left\| \frac{\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}}{3} - \mathbf{a} \right\|^2 \\
&= \frac{1}{9} \|\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a}\|^2 \\
&= \frac{1}{9} (\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a}) \cdot (\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a}) \\
&= \frac{1}{9} (4 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{c} - 4 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} - 4 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}).
\end{align*}Hence,
\[GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = \frac{1}{9} (6 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 6 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 6 \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{c} - 6 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} - 6 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} - 6 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) = 58,\]so
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} = 87.\]Then
\begin{align*}
AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2 &= \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{c}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{c}\|^2 \\
&= (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} - 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b}) \\
&\quad + (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} - 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c}) \\
&\quad + (\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} - 2 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c}) \\
&= 2 (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \\
&= \boxed{174}.
\end{align*}
We have that
\[x^2 = (e^t + e^{-t})^2 = e^{2t} + 2 + e^{-2t},\]and
\begin{align*}
\frac{y^2}{9} &= (e^t - e^{-t})^2 \\

\end{align*}Then
\[x^2 - \frac{y^2}{9} = 4,\]so
\[\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{36} = 1.\]Thus, all plotted points lie on a hyperbola
The answer is $\boxed{\text{(E)}}.$

From the formula for the distance between a point and a plane, the distance from the origin to plane $BCD$ is
$$\frac{|\frac{0}{a} + \frac{0}{b} + \frac{0}{c} - 1|}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{b^2}+\frac{1}{c^2}+\frac{1}{d^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2} + \frac{1}{d^2}}} = \frac{bcd}{\sqrt{b^2c^2+c^2d^2+d^2b^2}}.$$Since $x$ is the area of triangle $ABC,$ $x = \frac{1}{2} bc,$ so $bc = 2x.$  Similarly, $cd = 2y,$ and $bd = 2z,$ so the distance can be expressed as
\[\frac{bcd}{\sqrt{4x^2 + 4y^2 + 4z^2}} = \frac{bcd}{2 \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}.\]Let $K$ be the area of triangle $BCD.$  Using triangle $ABC$ as a base, the volume of the tetrahedron is $\frac{bcd}{6}.$  Using triangle $BCD$ as a base, the volume of the tetrahedron is $\frac{bcdK}{6\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}},$ so
$$\frac{bcd}{6}=\frac{bcdK}{6\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}},$$implying $K=\boxed{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}$.
Alternatively, the area of $BCD$ is also half the length of the cross product of the vectors $\overrightarrow{BC}= \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -c \\ d \end{pmatrix}$ and $\overrightarrow{BD} = \begin{pmatrix} -b \\ 0 \\ d \end{pmatrix}.$ This cross product is $\begin{pmatrix} -cd \\ -bd \\ -bc \end{pmatrix} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} y \\ z \\ x \end{pmatrix}$, which has length $2\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$
Thus the area of $BCD$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}$.
Taking the dot product of the given equation with $\mathbf{a},$ we get
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} = p (\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})) + q (\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})) + r (\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a})).\]Since $\mathbf{a}$ is orthogonal to both $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}$ and $\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a},$ we are left with
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} = q (\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})) = q.\]Then $q = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 1.$
Similarly, if we take the dot product of the given equation with $\mathbf{b},$ we get
\[\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} = p (\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})) + q (\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})) + r (\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a})).\]Since $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are orthogonal, we are left with
\[0 = r (\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a})).\]By the scalar triple product, $\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a})) = \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 1,$ so $r = 0.$  Similarly, by taking the dot product of both sides with $\mathbf{c},$ we are left with $p = 0.$
Therefore, $p + q + r = \boxed{1}.$
If $P = \left( 1, \theta, \frac{\pi}{6} \right),$ and $P$ has rectangular coordinates $(x,y,z),$ then
\[\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{\rho^2 \sin^2 \phi \cos^2 \theta + \rho^2 \sin^2 \phi \sin^2 \theta} = |\rho \sin \phi| = \frac{1}{2}.\]Hence, the radius of the circle is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$

Solution 1: We can rewrite the given equation as $x^2 - \sqrt{3} x + 1 = 0$, so by the quadratic formula,
\[x = \frac{\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{3 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \pm i}{2},\]which means $x = e^{\pi i/6}$ or $x = e^{11 \pi i/6}$.
If $x = e^{\pi i/6}$, then
\[x^{18} = e^{3 \pi i} = -1,\]and if $x = e^{11 \pi i/6}$, then
\[x^{18} = e^{33 \pi i} = -1.\]In either case, $x^{18} = \boxed{-1}$.
Solution 2: Squaring the given equation, we get
\[x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 3,\]which simplifies to $x^4 - x^2 + 1 = 0$
Then $(x^2 + 1)(x^4 - x^2 + 1) = 0$, which expands as $x^6 + 1 = 0$
Therefore, $x^6 = -1$, so $x^{18} = (x^6)^3 = (-1)^3 = \boxed{-1}$.
First, we can write $\mathbf{A}^{20} - 2 \mathbf{A}^{19} = \mathbf{A}^{19} (\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I}).$  We can compute that
\[\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I} =
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
.\]Then
\[\mathbf{A} (\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I}) =
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
= \mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I}.\]Then for any positive integer $n \ge 2,$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^n (\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I}) &= \mathbf{A}^{n - 1} \cdot \mathbf{A} (\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I}) \\
&= \mathbf{A}^{n - 1} (\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I}) \\
\end{align*}Hence,
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^{20} (\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I}) &= \mathbf{A}^{19} (\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I}) \\
&= \mathbf{A}^{18} (\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I}) \\
&= \dotsb \\
&= \mathbf{A}^2 (\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I}) \\
&= \mathbf{A} (\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I}) \\
&= \mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I} \\
&= \boxed{
\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
We have that $r = \sqrt{6^2 + (2 \sqrt{3})^2} = 4 \sqrt{3}.$  Also, if we draw the line connecting the origin and $(6,2 \sqrt{3}),$ this line makes an angle of $\frac{\pi}{6}$ with the positive $x$-axis.
unitsize(0.6 cm);
draw((-1,0)--(8,0));
draw((0,-1)--(0,4));

dot((6,2*sqrt(3)), red);
label("$(6,2 \sqrt{3})$", (6, 2*sqrt(3)), N);
dot((4*sqrt(3),0), red);
[/asy]
Therefore, the polar coordinates are $\boxed{\left( 4 \sqrt{3}, \frac{\pi}{6} \right)}.$

By the Law of Cosines on triangle $ABC,$
\begin{align*}
BC^2 &= AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AC \cdot AB \cos \angle BAC \\
&= AC^2 + AB^2 - AB \cdot AC \sqrt{3}.
\end{align*}From Pythagoras,
\[b^2 + c^2 = c^2 + \sqrt{75} + b^2 + \sqrt{75} - AB \cdot AC \sqrt{3},\]which gives us $AB \cdot AC = 10.$
Then the area of triangle $ABC$ is
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \sin \angle BAC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{5}{2}}.\]
Since $\cos (7 - 2 \pi) = \cos 7$ and $0 \le 7 - 2 \pi \le \pi,$ $\arccos (\cos 7) = \boxed{7 - 2 \pi}.$
Dividing both sides of $\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 21 \end{pmatrix}$ by 3, we get
\[\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}.\]This tells us that the first column of $\mathbf{M}$ is $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}.$
Since $\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix},$
\[\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -17 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -10 \end{pmatrix}.\]Dividing both sides by 5, we get
\[\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.\]This tells us that the second column of $\mathbf{M}$ is $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.$
Therefore,
\[\mathbf{M} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 7 & -2 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
The volume of the parallelepiped generated by $\mathbf{a},$ $\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a},$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is given by
\[|\mathbf{a} \cdot ((\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{b})|.\]In general, $\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{v} \cdot (\mathbf{w} \times \mathbf{u}),$ so
\[|\mathbf{a} \cdot ((\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{b})| = |(\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a})|.\]The dot product $(\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a})$ expands as
\[\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) + (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}).\]Since $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}$ are orthogonal, their dot product is 0
\[(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = \|\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}\|^2.\]Since
\[\|\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\]the volume of the parallelepiped is $\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.$
For the first line,
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 - t \\ 3 + 5t \end{pmatrix}.\]For the second line,
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -u
\\ 7 + 4u \end{pmatrix}.\]Hence, $2 - t = -u$ and $3 + 5t = 7 + 4u.$  Solving, we find $t = -4$ and $u = -6,$ so
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -17 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
From the half-angle formula,
\[\tan 7.5^\circ = \tan \frac{15^\circ}{2} = \frac{1 - \cos 15^\circ}{\sin 15^\circ}.\]Since $\cos 15^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6}}{4}$ and $\sin 15^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4},$
\begin{align*}
\tan 7.5^\circ &= \frac{1 - \frac{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6}}{4}}{\frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}} \\
&= \frac{4 - \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}} \\
&= \frac{(4 - \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6})(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}{(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})} \\
&= \frac{4 \sqrt{6} + 4 \sqrt{2} - 2 \sqrt{3} - 2 - 6 - 2 \sqrt{3}}{4} \\
&= \frac{4 \sqrt{6} - 4 \sqrt{3} + 4 \sqrt{2} - 8}{4} \\
&= \sqrt{6} - \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2} - 2.
\end{align*}Thus, $a + b + c + d = 6 + 3 + 2 + 2 = \boxed{13}.$
We know that $\arccos x$ is a decreasing function, and $\arcsin x$ is an increasing function
Furthermore, they are equal at $x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ when $\arccos \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \arcsin \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\pi}{4}.$
Therefore, the solution to $\arccos x > \arcsin x$ is $x \in \boxed{\left[ -1, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)}.$
Without loss of generality, set $CB = 1$
Then, by the Angle Bisector Theorem on triangle $DCB$, we have $CD = \frac{8}{15}$.

We apply the Law of Cosines to triangle $DCB$ to get
\[BD^2 = 1 + \frac{64}{225} - \frac{8}{15},\]which we can simplify to get $BD = \frac{13}{15}$.
Now, we have
\[\cos B = \frac{1 + \frac{169}{225} - \frac{64}{225}}{\frac{26}{15}} = \frac{11}{13},\]by another application of the Law of Cosines to triangle $DCB$.
In addition, since $B$ is acute, $\sin B = \sqrt{1 - \frac{121}{169}} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{13}$, so
\[\tan B = \frac{\sin B}{\cos B} = \boxed{\frac{4 \sqrt{3}}{11}}.\]
We have that
\[\tan (90^\circ - x) = \frac{\sin (90^\circ - x)}{\cos (90^\circ - x)} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\tan x}.\]Then
\[\log_{10} \tan x + \log_{10} \tan (90^\circ - x) = \log_{10} (\tan x \tan (90^\circ - x)) = \log_{10} 1 = 0.\]Summing over $x = 1^\circ,$ $2^\circ,$ $\dots,$ $44^\circ,$ the sum reduces to $\log_{10} \tan 45^\circ = \boxed{0}.$
We have that $\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 = \boxed{16}.$
Let $a = \cos x$ and $b = \sin x,$ so
\[\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = 2 \sqrt{2}.\]Then
\[a + b = 2ab \sqrt{2}.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 8a^2 b^2.\]Since $a^2 + b^2 = \cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1,$ $2ab + 1 = 8a^2 b^2,$ or
\[8a^2 b^2 - 2ab - 1 = 0.\]This factors as $(2ab - 1)(4ab + 1) = 0,$ so $ab = \frac{1}{2}$ or $ab = -\frac{1}{4}.$
If $ab = \frac{1}{2},$ then $a + b = \sqrt{2}.$  Then $a$ and $b$ are the roots of
\[t^2 - t \sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 0.\]We can factor this as $\left( t - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = 0,$ so $t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.$  Therefore, $a = b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ or
\[\cos x = \sin x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.\]The only solution is $x = \frac{\pi}{4}.$
If $ab = -\frac{1}{4},$ then $a + b = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.$  Then $a$ and $b$ are the roots of
\[t^2 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} t - \frac{1}{4} = 0.\]By the quadratic formula,
\[t = \frac{-\sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{6}}{4}.\]If $\cos x = \frac{-\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6}}{4}$ and $\sin x = \frac{-\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}}{4},$ then $x = \frac{19 \pi}{12}.$  (To compute this angle, we can use the fact that $\cos \frac{\pi}{12} = \frac{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6}}{4}$ and $\cos \frac{5 \pi}{12} = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}.$)
If $\cos x = \frac{-\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}}{4}$ and $\sin x = \frac{-\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6}}{4},$ then $x = \frac{11 \pi}{12}.$
Hence, the sum of all solutions is $\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{19 \pi}{12} + \frac{11 \pi}{12} = \boxed{\frac{11 \pi}{4}}.$
The given equation factors as
\[\sin x (2 \sin x - 1)(\sin x - 2) = 0,\]so $\sin x = 0,$ $\sin x = \frac{1}{2},$ or $\sin x = 2.$
The solutions to $\sin x = 0$ are $x = 0,$ $x = \pi,$ and $x = 2 \pi.$
The solutions to $\sin x = \frac{1}{2}$ are $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$ and $x = \frac{5 \pi}{6}.$
The equation $\sin x = 2$ has no solutions.
Thus, the solutions are $0,$ $\pi,$ $2 \pi,$ $\frac{\pi}{6},$ and $\frac{5 \pi}{6},$ for a total of $\boxed{5}$ solutions.
From the addition formula for tangent,
\begin{align*}
\tan \left( \arctan \left( \frac{a}{b + c} \right) + \arctan \left( \frac{b}{a + c} \right) \right) &= \frac{\frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{a + c}}{1 - \frac{a}{b + c} \cdot \frac{b}{a + c}} \\
&= \frac{a(a + c) + b(b + c)}{(a + c)(b + c) - ab} \\
&= \frac{a^2 + ac + b^2 + bc}{ab + ac + bc + c^2 - ab} \\
&= \frac{a^2 + b^2 + ac + bc}{ac + bc + c^2}.
\end{align*}Since $a^2 + b^2 = c^2,$ this tangent is 1
Furthermore,
\[0 < \arctan \left( \frac{a}{b + c} \right) + \arctan \left( \frac{b}{a + c} \right) < \pi,\]so
\[\arctan \left( \frac{a}{b + c} \right) + \arctan \left( \frac{b}{a + c} \right) = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{4}}.\]
Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix},$ so
\[\left\| \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \right\| = 4.\]Then $x^2 + y^2 = 16.$  Hence,
\[\|-3 \mathbf{v} \| = \left\| -3 \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \left\| \begin{pmatrix} -3x \\ -3y \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{(-3x)^2 + (-3y)^2} = 3 \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \boxed{12}.\]In general, $\|k \mathbf{v}\| = |k| \|\mathbf{v}\|.$
From the formula for an infinite geometric series,
\[\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \cos^{2n} \theta = 1 + \cos^2 \theta + \cos^4 \theta + \dotsb = \frac{1}{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = 5.\]Hence, $\cos^2 \theta = \frac{4}{5}.$  Then
\[\cos 2 \theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1 = \boxed{\frac{3}{5}}.\]

Note that $\angle COB = \angle OAB + \angle OBA = 3 \theta,$ so by the Law of Sines on triangle $BCO,$
\[\frac{OC}{BC} = \frac{\sin 2 \theta}{\sin 3 \theta}.\]Also, by the Law of Sines on triangle $ABC,$
\[\frac{AC}{BC} = \frac{\sin 3 \theta}{\sin 2 \theta}.\]Since $AC = 2OC,$
\[\frac{\sin 3 \theta}{\sin 2 \theta} = \frac{2 \sin 2 \theta}{\sin 3 \theta},\]so $\sin^2 3 \theta = 2 \sin^2 2 \theta.$  Then
\[(3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta)^2 = 2 (2 \sin \theta \cos \theta)^2.\]Since $\theta$ is acute, $\sin \theta \neq 0.$  Thus, we can divide both sides by $\sin^2 \theta,$ to get
\[(3 - 4 \sin^2 \theta)^2 = 8 \cos^2 \theta.\]We can write this as
\[(4 \cos^2 \theta - 1)^2 = 8 \cos^2 \theta.\]Using the identity $\cos 2 \theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1,$ we can also write this as
\[(2 \cos 2 \theta + 1)^2 = 4 + 4 \cos 2 \theta.\]This simplifies to
\[\cos^2 2 \theta = \frac{3}{4},\]so $\cos 2 \theta = \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.$  If $\cos 2 \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},$ then $2 \theta = 150^\circ,$ and $\theta = 75^\circ,$ which is clearly too large
So $\cos 2 \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},$ which means $2 \theta = 30^\circ,$ and $\theta = 15^\circ.$
Then $\angle ACB = 180^\circ - 2 \theta - 3 \theta = 105^\circ$ and $\angle AOB = 180^\circ - 3 \theta = 135^\circ,$ so $r = \frac{105}{135} = \boxed{\frac{7}{9}}.$
From the given equation,
\[3 \overrightarrow{OA} - 2 \overrightarrow{OB} = -5 \overrightarrow{OC} - k \overrightarrow{OD}.\]Let $P$ be the point such that
\[\overrightarrow{OP} = 3 \overrightarrow{OA} - 2 \overrightarrow{OB} = -5 \overrightarrow{OC} - k \overrightarrow{OD}.\]Since $3 + (-2) = 1,$ $P$ lies on line $AB.$  If $-5 - k = 1,$ then $P$ would also lie on line $CD,$ which forces $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ and $D$ to be coplanar
Solving $-5 - k = 1,$ we find $k = \boxed{-6}.$
We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} 1 & \cos (a - b) & \cos a \\ \cos(a - b) & 1 & \cos b \\ \cos a & \cos b & 1 \end{vmatrix} &= \begin{vmatrix} 1 & \cos b \\ \cos b & 1 \end{vmatrix} - \cos (a - b) \begin{vmatrix} \cos (a - b) & \cos b \\ \cos a  & 1 \end{vmatrix} + \cos a \begin{vmatrix} \cos (a - b) & 1 \\ \cos a  & \cos b \end{vmatrix} \\
&= (1 - \cos^2 b) - \cos (a - b)(\cos (a - b) - \cos a \cos b) + \cos a (\cos (a - b) \cos b - \cos a) \\
&= 1 - \cos^2 b - \cos^2 (a - b) + \cos a \cos b \cos(a - b) + \cos a \cos b \cos (a - b) - \cos^2 a \\
&= 1 - \cos^2 a - \cos^2 b - \cos^2 (a - b) + 2 \cos a \cos b \cos(a - b).
\end{align*}We can write
\begin{align*}
2 \cos a \cos b \cos (a - b) - \cos^2 (a - b) &= \cos (a - b) (2 \cos a \cos b - \cos (a - b)) \\
&= \cos (a - b) (\cos a \cos b - \sin a \sin b) \\
&= \cos (a - b) \cos (a + b) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} (\cos 2a + \cos 2b) \\
&= \cos^2 a - \frac{1}{2} + \cos^2 b - \frac{1}{2} \\
&= \cos^2 a + \cos^2 b - 1.
\end{align*}Therefore, the determinant is equal to $\boxed{0}.$
By the Law of Cosines, the cosine of one of the angles is
\[\frac{2^2 + 2^2 - (\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})^2}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{4 \sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\]so this angle is $\boxed{30^\circ}.$  The other two angles must be equal, so they are $\boxed{75^\circ, 75^\circ}.$
Note that for $0^\circ \le \theta \le 360^\circ,$ the real part of $\operatorname{cis} \theta$ lies between $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ if and only if $30^\circ \le \theta \le 45^\circ$ or $315^\circ \le \theta \le 330^\circ.$
The 15th roots of unity are of the form $\operatorname{cis} (24^\circ k),$ where $0 \le k \le 14.$  We can check that none of these values lie in $S,$ so $m$ must be at least 16.
unitsize (2 cm);
int k;
draw((-1.2,0)--(1.2,0));
draw((0,-1.2)--(0,1.2));
draw(Circle((0,0),1));

dot(dir(360/15*k));
draw((sqrt(2)/2,-1)--(sqrt(2)/2,1),red);
draw((sqrt(3)/2,-1)--(sqrt(3)/2,1),red);
[/asy]
We claim that for each $n \ge 16,$ there exists a complex number $z \in S$ such that $z^n = 1.$
For a positive integer, the $n$th roots of unity are of the form
\[\operatorname{cis} \frac{360^\circ k}{n}\]for $0 \le k \le n - 1.$  For $16 \le n \le 24,$
\[30^\circ \le \frac{360^\circ \cdot 2}{n} \le 45^\circ,\]so for $16 \le n \le 24,$ we can find an $n$th root of unity in $S.$
Furthermore, for $n \ge 24,$ the difference in the arguments between consecutive $n$th roots of unity is $\frac{360^\circ}{n} \le 15^\circ,$ so there must be an $n$th root of unity whose argument $\theta$ lies in the interval $15^\circ \le \theta \le 30^\circ.$  We conclude that the smallest such $m$ is $\boxed{16}.$
We have that
\[\mathbf{M} \mathbf{M}^T = \mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 & -2 \\ a & 2 & b \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & a \\ 2 & 1 & 2 \\ 2 & -2 & b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 9 & 0 & a + 2b + 4 \\ 0 & 9 & 2a - 2b + 2 \\ a + 2b + 4 & 2a - 2b + 2 & a^2 + b^2 + 4 \end{pmatrix}.\]We want this to equal $9 \mathbf{I},$ so $a + 2b + 4 = 0,$ $2a - 2b + 2 = 0,$ and $a^2 + b^2 + 4 = 9.$  Solving, we find $(a,b) = \boxed{(-2,-1)}.$
The function $f(x) = \arcsin (\log_m (nx))$ is defined when
\[-1 \le \log_m (nx) \le 1.\]This is equivalent to
\[\frac{1}{m} \le nx \le m,\]or
\[\frac{1}{mn} \le x \le \frac{m}{n}.\]Thus, the length of the interval is $\frac{m}{n} - \frac{1}{mn} = \frac{m^2 - 1}{mn},$ giving us the equation
\[\frac{m^2 - 1}{mn} = \frac{1}{2013}.\]Hence
\[n = \frac{2013 (m^2 - 1)}{m} = \frac{2013m^2 - 2013}{m}.\]We want to minimize $n + m = \frac{2014m^2 - 2013}{m}.$  It is not hard to prove that this is an increasing function for $m \ge 1;$ thus, we want to find the smallest possible value of $m.$
Because $m$ and $m^2 - 1$ are relatively prime, $m$ must divide 2013
The prime factorization of 2013 is $3 \cdot 11 \cdot 61.$  The smallest possible value for $m$ is then 3
For $m = 3,$
\[n = \frac{2013 (3^2 - 1)}{3} = 5368,\]and the smallest possible value of $m + n$ is $\boxed{5371}.$
The line passes through $\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},$ so its direction vector is proportional to
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}.\]To get a $y$-coordinate of $-1,$ we can multiply this vector by the scalar $\frac{1}{5}.$  This gives us
\[\frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.\]Therefore, $a = \boxed{\frac{3}{5}}.$
Since $\begin{pmatrix} a & 3 \\ -8 & d \end{pmatrix}$ is its own inverse,
\[\begin{pmatrix} a & 3 \\ -8 & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & 3 \\ -8 & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & 3 \\ -8 & d \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{I}.\]This gives us
\[\begin{pmatrix} a^2 - 24 & 3a + 3d \\ -8a - 8d & d^2 - 24 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{I}.\]Then $a^2 - 24 = 1,$ $3a + 3d = 0,$ $-8a - 8d = 0,$ and $d^2 - 24 = 1.$  Hence, $a + d = 0,$ $a^2 = 25,$ and $d^2 = 25.$  The possible pairs $(a,d)$ are then $(5,-5)$ and $(-5,5),$ giving us $\boxed{2}$ solutions.
Since $wz = 12-8i$, we have  \[|wz| = |12-8i| = |4(3-2i)| = 4|3-2i| = 4\sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2} = 4\sqrt{13}.\]Since $|wz| = |w|\cdot |z|$, we have $|w|\cdot |z| = 4\sqrt{13}$
Finally, since we are given that $|w| = \sqrt{13}$, we have $|z| = \boxed{4}$.
Note that
\[\mathbf{A} \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -15 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^2 \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} &= \mathbf{A} \mathbf{A} \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \mathbf{A} \left( -3 \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right) \\
&= -3 \mathbf{A} \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= -3  \left( -3 \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right) \\
&= (-3)^2 \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}In the same way, we can compute that
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^3 \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} &= (-3)^3 \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}, \\
\mathbf{A}^4 \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} &= (-3)^4 \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}, \\
\mathbf{A}^5 \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} &= (-3)^5 \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -1215 \\ 486 \end{pmatrix}}.
\end{align*}
We have that
\[\cos^2 A = 1 - \sin^2 A = \frac{16}{25},\]so $\cos A = \pm \frac{4}{5}.$
\[\sin^2 B = 1 - \cos^2 B = \frac{144}{169}.\]Since $\sin B$ is positive, $\sin B = \frac{12}{13}.$
\begin{align*}
\sin C &= \sin (180^\circ - A - B) \\
&= \sin (A + B) \\
&= \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B \\
&= \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{13} \pm \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{12}{13}.
\end{align*}Since $\sin C$ must be positive, $\cos A = \frac{4}{5}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
\cos C &= \cos (180^\circ - A - B) \\
&= -\cos (A + B) \\
&= -(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B) \\
&= -\left( \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{13} - \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{12}{13} \right) \\
&= \boxed{\frac{16}{65}}.
\end{align*}
Let $\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^3 &= \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\ ac + cd & bc + d^2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} a^3 + 2abc + bcd & a^2 b + abd + bd^2 + bcd \\ a^2 c + acd + c^2 + bcd & abc + 2bcd + d^3 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}Thus, comparing entries, we get
\begin{align*}
a^3 + 2abc + bcd &= 0, \\
b(a^2 + ad + d^2 + bc) &= 0, \\
c(a^2 + ad + d^2 + bc) &= 0, \\
abc + 2bcd + d^3 &= 0.
\end{align*}Also, we know $(\det \mathbf{A})^3 = \det (\mathbf{A}^3) = 0,$ so $ad - bc = \det \mathbf{A} = 0,$ or $bc = ad.$  Replacing $bc$ with $ad$ in the equations above, we get
\begin{align*}
a(a^2 + 2ad + d^2) &= 0, \\
b(a^2 + 2ad + d^2) &= 0, \\
c(a^2 + 2ad + d^2) &= 0, \\
d(a^2 + 2ad + d^2) &= 0.
\end{align*}If $a^2 + 2ad + d^2 \neq 0,$ then we must have $a = b = c = d = 0.$  But then $a^2 + 2ad + d^2 = 0,$ contradiction, so we must have
\[a^2 + 2ad + d^2 = 0\]Then $(a + d)^2 = 0,$ so $a + d = 0,$ or $d = -a.$  Then
\[\mathbf{A}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & -a \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & -a \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & 0 \\ 0 & a^2 + bc \end{pmatrix}.\]Since $ad - bc = 0$ and $d = -a,$ $-a^2 - bc = 0,$ so $a^2 + bc = 0,$ which means $\mathbf{A}^2$ must be the zero matrix
Thus, there is only $\boxed{1}$ possibility for $\mathbf{A}^2.$
Since the area of the parallelogram generated by the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is 8,
\[\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = 8.\]Then the area of the parallelogram generated by the vectors $2 \mathbf{a} + 3 \mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - 5 \mathbf{b}$ is
\[\|(2 \mathbf{a} + 3 \mathbf{b}) \times (\mathbf{a} - 5 \mathbf{b})\|.\]Expanding the cross product, we get
\begin{align*}
(2 \mathbf{a} + 3 \mathbf{b}) \times (\mathbf{a} - 5 \mathbf{b}) &= 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} - 10 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} + 3 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 15 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{b} \\
&= \mathbf{0} - 10 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{0} \\
&= -13 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\end{align*}Thus, $\|(2 \mathbf{a} + 3 \mathbf{b}) \times (\mathbf{a} - 5 \mathbf{b})\| = 13 \|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \boxed{104}.$
Expanding the dot product, we get
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{b} \cdot (7 \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a}) &= 7 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} \\
&= 7 \cdot 6 - 2 \cdot (-3) = \boxed{48}.
\end{align*}
Since $|z| = 1,$ $z = e^{i \theta}$ for some angle $\theta.$  Then
\begin{align*}
\left| \frac{z}{\overline{z}} + \frac{\overline{z}}{z} \right| &= \left| \frac{e^{i \theta}}{e^{-i \theta}} + \frac{e^{-i \theta}}{e^{i \theta}} \right| \\
&= |e^{2i \theta} + e^{-2i \theta}| \\
&= |\cos 2 \theta + i \sin 2 \theta + \cos 2 \theta - i \sin 2 \theta| \\
&= 2 |\cos 2 \theta|.
\end{align*}Thus, $\cos 2 \theta = \pm \frac{1}{2}.$
For $\cos 2 \theta = \frac{1}{2},$ there are four solutions between 0 and $2 \pi,$ namely $\frac{\pi}{6},$ $\frac{5 \pi}{6},$ $\frac{7 \pi}{6},$ and $\frac{11 \pi}{6}.$
For $\cos 2 \theta = -\frac{1}{2},$ there are four solutions between 0 and $2 \pi,$ namely $\frac{\pi}{3},$ $\frac{2 \pi}{3},$ $\frac{4 \pi}{3},$ and $\frac{5 \pi}{3}.$
Therefore, there are $\boxed{8}$ solutions in $z.$
The function $f(x) = \sin \frac{x}{3} + \sin \frac{x}{11}$ achieves its maximum value when $\sin \frac{x}{3} = \sin \frac{x}{11} = 1,$ which means $\frac{x}{3} = 360^\circ a + 90^\circ$ and $\frac{x}{11} = 360^\circ b + 90^\circ$ for some integers $a$ and $b.$  Then
\[x = 1080^\circ a + 270^\circ = 3960^\circ b + 990^\circ.\]This simplifies to
\[3a = 11b + 2.\]The smallest nonnegative integer $b$ that makes $11b + 2$ a multiple of 3 is $b = 2,$ which makes $x = \boxed{8910^\circ}.$
Since $AP:PB = 10:3,$ we can write
\[\frac{\overrightarrow{P} - \overrightarrow{A}}{10} = \frac{\overrightarrow{P} - \overrightarrow{B}}{7}.\]Isolating $\overrightarrow{P},$ we find
\[\overrightarrow{P} = -\frac{3}{7} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{10}{7} \overrightarrow{B}.\]Thus, $(t,u) = \boxed{\left( -\frac{3}{7}, \frac{10}{7} \right)}.$
Since $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0},$ $\mathbf{c} = -\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}.$  Substituting, we get
\[k (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) + \mathbf{b} \times (-\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) + (-\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}.\]Expanding, we get
\[k (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}.\]Since $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{0},$ this reduces to
\[(k - 2) (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{0}.\]We must have $k = \boxed{2}.$
The midpoint of $(-1,7)$ and $(5,-5)$ is
\[\left( \frac{-1 + 5}{2}, \frac{7 - 2}{2} \right) = (2,1).\]This tells us that the vector being reflected over is a scalar multiple of $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  We can then assume that the vector being reflected over is $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$

The projection of $\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ onto $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is
\[\operatorname{proj}_{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{-5}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.\]Hence, the reflection of $\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ is $2 \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}}.$
From the given information,
\[\frac{\overrightarrow{D} - \overrightarrow{B}}{3} = \overrightarrow{D} - \overrightarrow{C}.\]Isolating $\overrightarrow{D},$ we get
\[\overrightarrow{D} = \frac{3}{2} \overrightarrow{C} - \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{B}.\]Also,
\[\overrightarrow{E} = \frac{3}{8} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{5}{8} \overrightarrow{C}.\]Isolating $\overrightarrow{C}$ in each equation, we obtain
\[\overrightarrow{C} = \frac{2 \overrightarrow{D} + \overrightarrow{B}}{3} = \frac{8 \overrightarrow{E} - 3 \overrightarrow{A}}{5}.\]Then $10 \overrightarrow{D} + 5 \overrightarrow{B} = 24 \overrightarrow{E} - 9 \overrightarrow{A},$ so $10 \overrightarrow{D} + 9 \overrightarrow{A} = 24 \overrightarrow{E} - 5 \overrightarrow{B},$ or
\[\frac{10}{19} \overrightarrow{D} + \frac{9}{19} \overrightarrow{A} = \frac{24}{19} \overrightarrow{E} - \frac{5}{19} \overrightarrow{B}.\]Since the coefficients on both sides of the equation add up to 1, the vector on the left side lies on line $AD,$ and the vector on the right side lies on line $BE.$  Therefore, this common vector is $\overrightarrow{P}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow{P} &= \frac{10}{19} \overrightarrow{D} + \frac{9}{19} \overrightarrow{A} \\
&= \frac{10}{19} \left( \frac{3}{2} \overrightarrow{C} - \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{B} \right) + \frac{9}{19} \overrightarrow{A} \\
&= \frac{9}{19} \overrightarrow{A} - \frac{5}{19} \overrightarrow{B} + \frac{15}{19} \overrightarrow{C}.
\end{align*}Thus, $(x,y,z) = \boxed{\left( \frac{9}{19}, -\frac{5}{19}, \frac{15}{19} \right)}.$
Consider a right triangle where the opposite side is 5 and the hypotenuse is 13.

label("$\theta$", (5,1));
[/asy]
Then $\sin \theta = \frac{5}{13},$ so $\theta = \arcsin \frac{5}{13}.$  By Pythagoras, the adjacent side is 12, so $\cos \theta = \boxed{\frac{12}{13}}.$
Since $x = 2 \cos t - \sin t$ and $y = 4 \sin t,$
\begin{align*}
ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 &= a (2 \cos t - \sin t)^2 + b (2 \cos t - \sin t)(4 \sin t) + c (4 \sin t)^2 \\
&= a (4 \cos^2 t - 4 \cos t \sin t + \sin^2 t) + b (8 \cos t \sin t - 4 \sin^2 t) + c (16 \sin^2 t) \\
&= 4a \cos^2 t + (-4a + 8b) \cos t \sin t + (a - 4b + 16c) \sin^2 t.
\end{align*}To make this simplify to 1, we set
\begin{align*}
4a &= 1, \\
-4a + 8b &= 0, \\
a - 4b + 16c &= 1.
\end{align*}Solving this system, we find $(a,b,c) = \boxed{\left( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{5}{64} \right)}.$
From the double angle formula,
\[\cos 2 \theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1 = 2 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 - 1 = \boxed{-\frac{1}{9}}.\]
Note that given complex numbers $a$ and $b$ in the plane, there are two complex numbers $c$ such that $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ form an equilateral triangle
They are shown as $c_1$ and $c_2$ below.

label("$a$", A, SE);

label("$c_1$", C[1], NE);
label("$c_2$", C[2], SW);
[/asy]
Then for either position of $c,$
\[\frac{c - a}{b - a}\]is equal to $e^{\pm \pi i/6}.$  Note that both $z = e^{\pm \pi i/6}$ satisfy $z^2 - z + 1 = 0.$  Thus,
\[\left( \frac{c - a}{b - a} \right)^2 - \frac{c - a}{b - a} + 1 = 0.\]This simplifies to
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = ab + ac + bc.\]Then
\[(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 3(ab + ac + bc).\]Hence,
\[|ab + ac + bc| = \frac{|a + b + c|^2}{3} = \frac{36^2}{3} = \boxed{432}.\]
Consider a right triangle where the adjacent side is 4 and the opposite side is 7.

Then $\cot \theta = \frac{4}{7},$ so $\theta = \operatorname{arccot} \frac{4}{7}.$  Hence, $\tan \theta = \frac{1}{\cot \theta} = \boxed{\frac{7}{4}}.$
We can write
\begin{align*}
2 &= \overrightarrow{AB} \cdot \overrightarrow{AE} + \overrightarrow{AC} \cdot \overrightarrow{AF} \\

&= \overrightarrow{AB} \cdot \overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{AB} \cdot \overrightarrow{BE} + \overrightarrow{AC} \cdot \overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{AC} \cdot \overrightarrow{BF}.
\end{align*}Since $AB = 1,$
\[\overrightarrow{AB} \cdot \overrightarrow{AB} = \|\overrightarrow{AB}\|^2 = 1.\]By the Law of Cosines,
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow{AC} \cdot \overrightarrow{AB} &= AC \cdot AB \cdot \cos \angle BAC \\
&= \sqrt{33} \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1^2 + (\sqrt{33})^2 - 6^2}{2 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{33}} \\
&= -1.
\end{align*}Let $\theta$ be the angle between vectors $\overrightarrow{EF}$ and $\overrightarrow{BC}.$  Since $B$ is the midpoint of $\overline{EF},$ $\overrightarrow{BE} = -\overrightarrow{BF},$ so
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow{AB} \cdot \overrightarrow{BE} + \overrightarrow{AC} \cdot \overrightarrow{BF} &= -\overrightarrow{AB} \cdot \overrightarrow{BF} + \overrightarrow{AC} \cdot \overrightarrow{BF} \\
&= (\overrightarrow{AC} - \overrightarrow{AB}) \cdot \overrightarrow{BF} \\
&= \overrightarrow{BC} \cdot \overrightarrow{BF} \\
&= BC \cdot BF \cdot \cos \theta \\
&= 3 \cos \theta.
\end{align*}Putting everything together, we get
\[1 - 1 + 3 \cos \theta = 2,\]so $\cos \theta = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.$
In general, from the angle addition formula,
\begin{align*}
\tan x + \tan y &= \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} + \frac{\sin y}{\cos y} \\
&= \frac{\sin x \cos y + \sin y \cos x}{\cos x \cos y} \\
&= \frac{\sin (x + y)}{\cos x \cos y}.
\end{align*}Thus,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\tan 30^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 50^\circ + \tan 60^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} &= \frac{\frac{\sin 70^\circ}{\cos 30^\circ \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{\sin 110^\circ}{\cos 50^\circ \cos 60^\circ}}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{1}{\cos 30^\circ \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos 50^\circ \cos 60^\circ} \\
&= \frac{2}{\sqrt{3} \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{2}{\cos 50^\circ} \\
&= 2 \cdot \frac{\cos 50^\circ + \sqrt{3} \cos 40^\circ}{\sqrt{3} \cos 40^\circ \cos 50^\circ} \\
&= 4 \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{2} \cos 50^\circ + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos 40^\circ}{\sqrt{3} \cos 40^\circ \cos 50^\circ} \\
&= 4 \cdot \frac{\cos 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ + \sin 60^\circ \cos 40^\circ}{\sqrt{3} \cos 40^\circ \cos 50^\circ}.
\end{align*}From the angle addition formula and product-to-sum formula,
\begin{align*}
4 \cdot \frac{\cos 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ + \sin 60^\circ \cos 40^\circ}{\sqrt{3} \cos 40^\circ \cos 50^\circ} &= 4 \cdot \frac{\sin (60^\circ + 40^\circ)}{\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} (\cos 90^\circ + \cos 10^\circ)} \\
&= \frac{8 \sin 100^\circ}{\sqrt{3} \cos 10^\circ} \\
&= \frac{8 \cos 10^\circ}{\sqrt{3} \cos 10^\circ} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{8 \sqrt{3}}{3}}.
\end{align*}
From $\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{w}$ and $\mathbf{w} \times \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{v},$
\[(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}) \times \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{v}.\]Expanding, we get
\[(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{v}.\]We know that $\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{0}.$  By the vector triple product, for any vectors $\mathbf{p},$ $\mathbf{q},$ and $\mathbf{r},$
\[\mathbf{p} \times (\mathbf{q} \times \mathbf{r}) = (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{r}) \mathbf{q} - (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q}) \mathbf{r}.\]Hence,
\[(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}) \mathbf{v} - (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{v}.\]Since $\|\mathbf{u}\| = 1,$ $\mathbf{v} - (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{v}.$  Then
\[(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{0}.\]Again, since $\|\mathbf{u}\| = 1,$ we must have $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0.$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}) &= \mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u})) \\
&= \mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u}) \\
&= \mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v})) + \mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u}).
\end{align*}By the vector triple product,
\[\mathbf{v} \times (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}) = (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{u} - (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}) \mathbf{u}.\]Since $\|\mathbf{v}\| = 1$ and $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0,$ this simplifies to $\mathbf{u}.$  Also, $\mathbf{u}$ is orthogonal to $\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u},$ so
\[\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = \boxed{1}.\]
Taking $x = 0,$ we get $\sin \theta > 0.$  Taking $x = 1,$ we get $\cos \theta > 0.$  Hence, $0 < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}.$
Then we can write
\begin{align*}
&x^2 \cos \theta - x(1 - x) + (1 - x)^2 \sin \theta \\
&= x^2 \cos \theta - 2x (1 - x) \sqrt{\cos \theta \sin \theta} + (1 - x)^2 \sin \theta + 2x (1 - x) \sqrt{\cos \theta \sin \theta} - x(1 - x) \\
&= (x \sqrt{\cos \theta} - (1 - x) \sqrt{\sin \theta})^2 + x(1 - x) (2 \sqrt{\cos \theta \sin \theta} - 1).
\end{align*}Solving $x \sqrt{\cos \theta} = (1 - x) \sqrt{\sin \theta},$ we find
\[x = \frac{\sqrt{\sin \theta}}{\sqrt{\cos \theta} + \sqrt{\sin \theta}},\]which does lie in the interval $[0,1].$  For this value of $x,$ the expression becomes
\[x(1 - x) (2 \sqrt{\cos \theta \sin \theta} - 1),\]which forces $2 \sqrt{\cos \theta \sin \theta} - 1 > 0,$ or $4 \cos \theta \sin \theta > 1.$  Equivalently, $\sin 2 \theta > \frac{1}{2}.$  Since $0 < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2},$ $0 < 2 \theta < \pi,$ and the solution is $\frac{\pi}{6} < 2 \theta < \frac{5 \pi}{6},$ or
\[\frac{\pi}{12} < \theta < \frac{5 \pi}{12}.\]Conversely, if $\frac{\pi}{12} < \theta < \frac{5 \pi}{12},$ then $\cos \theta > 0,$ $\sin \theta > 0,$ and $\sin 2 \theta > \frac{1}{2},$ so
\begin{align*}
&x^2 \cos \theta - x(1 - x) + (1 - x)^2 \sin \theta \\
&= x^2 \cos \theta - 2x (1 - x) \sqrt{\cos \theta \sin \theta} + (1 - x)^2 \sin \theta + 2x (1 - x) \sqrt{\cos \theta \sin \theta} - x(1 - x) \\
&= (x \sqrt{\cos \theta} - (1 - x) \sqrt{\sin \theta})^2 + x(1 - x) (2 \sqrt{\cos \theta \sin \theta} - 1) > 0.
\end{align*}Thus, the solutions $\theta$ are $\theta \in \boxed{\left( \frac{\pi}{12}, \frac{5 \pi}{12} \right)}.$
The graphs of both $\tan x$ and $\cot x$ have period $\pi.$  This means that the graph of $y = \tan x + \cot x$ repeats after an interval of $\pi,$ but this does not necessarily show that the period is $\pi.$
We can write
\[y = \tan x + \cot x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} + \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x}{\sin x \cos x} = \frac{1}{\sin x \cos x}.\]If $0 < x < \frac{\pi}{2},$ then $\sin x > 0$ and $\cos x > 0,$ so $\frac{1}{\sin x \cos x} > 0.$
If $\frac{\pi}{2} < x < \pi,$ then $\sin x > 0$ and $\cos x < 0,$ so $\frac{1}{\sin x \cos x} < 0.$
If $\pi < x < \frac{3 \pi}{2},$ then $\sin x < 0$ and $\cos x < 0,$ so $\frac{1}{\sin x \cos x} > 0.$
Therefore, the graph of $y = \tan x + \cot x$ also has period $\boxed{\pi}.$
The graph of $y = \tan x + \cot x$ is shown below:

From the distance formula, we compute that $AB = 3 \sqrt{2},$ $AC = \sqrt{14},$ and $BC = \sqrt{2}.$  Then from the Law of Cosines,
\[\cos \angle ABC = \frac{(3 \sqrt{2})^2 + (\sqrt{2})^2 - (\sqrt{14})^2}{2 \cdot 3 \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2}.\]Therefore, $\angle ABC = \boxed{60^\circ}.$
Note that
\begin{align*}
\cot \theta - 2 \cot 2 \theta &= \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} - \frac{2 \cos 2 \theta}{\sin 2 \theta} \\
&= \frac{2 \cos^2 \theta}{2 \sin \theta \cos \theta} - \frac{2 (\cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta)}{2 \sin \theta \cos \theta} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin^2 \theta}{2 \sin \theta \cos \theta} \\
&= \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \\
&= \tan \theta.
\end{align*}Taking $\theta = x,$ $2x,$ and $4x,$ we get
\begin{align*}
\cot x - 2 \cot 2x &= \tan x, \\
\cot 2x - 2 \cot 4x &= \tan 2x, \\
\cot 4x - 2 \cot 8x &= \tan 4x.
\end{align*}Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\tan x + 2 \tan 2x + 4 \tan 4x + 8 \cot 8x &= \cot x - 2 \cot 2x + 2 (\cot 2x - 2 \cot 4x) + 4 (\cot 4x - 2 \cot 8x) + 8 \cot 8x \\
&= \boxed{\cot x}.
\end{align*}
Note that
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^2 &= \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ -9 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ -9 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} 7 & 2 \\ -18 & -5 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= 2 \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ -9 & -2 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= 2 \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}.
\end{align*}Then $\mathbf{A}^2 - 2 \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I} = 0,$ so
\[(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I})^2 = \mathbf{A}^2 - 2 \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{0}.\]Thus, let
\[\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ -9 & -2 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ -9 & -3 \end{pmatrix}.\]Then $\mathbf{B}^2 = \mathbf{0},$ and $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{I},$ so by the Binomial Theorem,
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^{100} &= (\mathbf{B} + \mathbf{I})^{100} \\
&= \mathbf{B}^{100} + \binom{100}{1} \mathbf{B}^{99} + \binom{100}{2} \mathbf{B}^{98} + \dots + \binom{100}{98} \mathbf{B}^2 + \binom{100}{99} \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{I} \\
&= 100 \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{I} \\
&= 100 \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ -9 & -3 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 301 & 100 \\ -900 & -299 \end{pmatrix}}.
\end{align*}Note: We can expand $(\mathbf{B} + \mathbf{I})^{100}$ using the Binomial Theorem because the matrices $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{I}$ commute, i.e
$\mathbf{B} \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{I} \mathbf{B}.$  In general, expanding a power of $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$ is difficult
For example,
\[(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B})^2 = \mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{A} \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{B} \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}^2,\]and without knowing more about $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B},$ this cannot be simplified.
We can write
\begin{align*}
(1 + \cot A - \csc A)(1 + \tan A + \sec A) &= \left( 1 + \frac{\cos A}{\sin A} - \frac{1}{\sin A} \right) \left( 1 + \frac{\sin A}{\cos A} + \frac{1}{\cos A} \right) \\
&= \frac{(\sin A + \cos A - 1)(\cos A + \sin A + 1)}{\sin A \cos A} \\
&= \frac{(\sin A + \cos A)^2 - 1}{\sin A \cos A} \\
&= \frac{\sin^2 A + 2 \sin A \cos A + \cos^2 A - 1}{\sin A \cos A} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin A \cos A}{\sin A \cos A} = \boxed{2}.
\end{align*}
From the identity $\tan (90^\circ - x) = \frac{1}{\tan x},$ we have that
\[\tan 65^\circ - 2 \tan 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 25^\circ} - \frac{2}{\tan 50^\circ}.\]By the double-angle formula,
\[\frac{1}{\tan 25^\circ} - \frac{2}{\tan 50^\circ} = \frac{1}{\tan 25^\circ} - \frac{1 - \tan^2 25^\circ}{\tan 25^\circ} = \tan 25^\circ,\]so $\arctan (\tan 65^\circ - 2 \tan 40^\circ) = \boxed{25^\circ}.$
We can express all the terms in terms of $\cos 2x$:
\begin{align*}
\cos 4x &= 2 \cos^2 2x - 1, \\
\cos^2 3x &= \frac{\cos 6x + 1}{2} = \frac{4 \cos^3 2x - 3 \cos 2x + 1}{2}, \\
\cos^3 2x &= \cos^3 2x, \\
\cos^4 x &= (\cos^2 x)^2 = \left( \frac{\cos 2x + 1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{\cos^2 2x + 2 \cos 2x + 1}{4}.
\end{align*}Thus,
\[2 \cos^2 2x - 1 + \frac{4 \cos^3 2x - 3 \cos 2x + 1}{2} + \cos^3 2x + \frac{\cos^2 2x + 2 \cos 2x + 1}{4} = 0.\]This simplifies to
\[12 \cos^3 2x + 9 \cos^2 2x - 4 \cos 2x - 1 = 0.\]We can factor this as
\[(\cos 2x + 1)(12 \cos^2 2x - 3 \cos 2x - 1) = 0.\]If $\cos 2x + 1 = 0,$ then $\cos 2x = -1.$  There are 2 solutions, namely $\pm \frac{\pi}{2}.$  Otherwise,
\[12 \cos^2 2x - 3 \cos 2x - 1 = 0.\]By the quadratic formula,
\[\cos 2x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{57}}{12}.\]Both values lie between $-1$ and $1,$ so for each value, there are 4 solutions
This gives us a total of $2 + 4 + 4 = \boxed{10}$ solutions.
We can take $\begin{pmatrix} 12 \\ -4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector of the plane
Then the equation of the plane is of the form
\[12x - 4y + 3z + D = 0.\]Substituting in the coordinates of $(12,-4,3),$ we find that the equation of the plane is $\boxed{12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0}.$
We have that
\[\begin{vmatrix} -5 & 3 \\ 4 & -4 \end{vmatrix} = (-5)(-4) - (3)(4) = \boxed{8}.\]
Squaring the given equation, we get
\[e^{2 i \theta} = \left( \frac{2 + i \sqrt{5}}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{-1 + 4i \sqrt{5}}{9}.\]Squaring again, we get
\[e^{4 i \theta} = \left( \frac{-1 + 4i \sqrt{5}}{9} \right)^2 = \frac{-79 - 8i \sqrt{5}}{81}.\]Therefore, $\sin 4 \theta = \boxed{-\frac{8 \sqrt{5}}{81}}.$
In general, By DeMoivre's Theorem,
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{cis} n \theta &= (\operatorname{cis} \theta)^n \\
&= (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)^n \\
&= \cos^n \theta + \binom{n}{1} i \cos^{n - 1} \theta \sin \theta - \binom{n}{2} \cos^{n - 2} \theta \sin^2 \theta - \binom{n}{3} i \cos^{n - 3} \theta \sin^3 \theta + \dotsb.
\end{align*}Matching real and imaginary parts, we get
\begin{align*}
\cos n \theta &= \cos^n \theta - \binom{n}{2} \cos^{n - 2} \theta \sin^2 \theta + \binom{n}{4} \cos^{n - 4} \theta \sin^4 \theta - \dotsb, \\
\sin n \theta &= \binom{n}{1} \cos^{n - 1} \theta \sin \theta - \binom{n}{3} \cos^{n - 3} \theta \sin^3 \theta + \binom{n}{5} \cos^{n - 5} \theta \sin^5 \theta - \dotsb.
\end{align*}For $n = 7,$
\begin{align*}
\sin 7 \theta &= 7 \cos^6 \theta \sin \theta - 35 \cos^4 \theta \sin^3 \theta + 21 \cos^2 \theta \sin^5 \theta - \sin^7 \theta \\
&= 7 (1 - \sin^2 \theta)^3 \sin \theta - 35 (1 - \sin^2 \theta)^2 \sin^3 \theta + 21 (1 - \sin^2 \theta) \sin^5 \theta - \sin^7 \theta \\
&= -64 \sin^7 \theta + 112 \sin^5 \theta - 56 \sin^3 \theta + 7 \sin \theta \\
&= -\sin \theta (64 \sin^6 \theta - 112 \sin^4 \theta + 56 \sin^2 \theta - 7).
\end{align*}For $\theta = \frac{k \pi}{7},$ $k = 1,$ 2, and 3, $\sin 7 \theta = 0,$ so $\sin^2 \frac{\pi}{7},$ $\sin^2 \frac{2 \pi}{7},$ and $\sin^2 \frac{3 \pi}{7}$ are the roots of
\[64x^3 - 112x^2 + 56x - 7 = 0.\]Thus,
\[64 \left( x - \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{7} \right) \left( x - \sin^2 \frac{2 \pi}{7} \right) \left( x - \sin^2 \frac{3 \pi}{7} \right) = 64x^3 - 112x^2 + 56x - 7\]for all $x.$  Taking $x = 2,$ we get
\[64 \left( 2 - \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{7} \right) \left( 2 - \sin^2 \frac{2 \pi}{7} \right) \left( 2 - \sin^2 \frac{3 \pi}{7} \right) = 169,\]so
\[\sqrt{\left( 2 - \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{7} \right) \left( 2 - \sin^2 \frac{2 \pi}{7} \right) \left( 2 - \sin^2 \frac{3 \pi}{7} \right)} = \boxed{\frac{13}{8}}.\]
Note that $(1,3)$ and $(3,4)$ are two points on the line, so the line has a direction vector of
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.\][asy]

The vector going from $(1,3)$ to $(6,1)$ is $\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.$  Projecting this vector onto the direction vector, we get
\[\operatorname{proj}_{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right\|^2} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{8}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{16}{5} \\ \frac{8}{5} \end{pmatrix}.\][asy]

Note that $\arctan \frac{1}{3},$ $\arctan \frac{1}{4},$ and $\arctan \frac{1}{5}$ are all less than $\arctan \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\pi}{6},$ so their sum is acute.
By the tangent addition formula,
\[\tan (\arctan a + \arctan b) = \frac{a + b}{1 - ab}.\]Then
\[\tan \left( \arctan \frac{1}{3} + \arctan \frac{1}{4} \right) = \frac{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}{1 - \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{7}{11},\]so
\[\arctan \frac{1}{3} + \arctan \frac{1}{4} = \arctan \frac{7}{11}.\]Then
\[\tan \left( \arctan \frac{1}{3} + \arctan \frac{1}{4} + \arctan \frac{1}{5} \right) = \tan \left( \arctan \frac{7}{11} + \arctan \frac{1}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{7}{11} + \frac{1}{5}}{1 - \frac{7}{11} \cdot \frac{1}{5}} = \frac{23}{24},\]so
\[\arctan \frac{1}{3} + \arctan \frac{1}{4} + \arctan \frac{1}{5} = \arctan \frac{23}{24}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n} &= \tan \left( \frac{\pi}{4} - \arctan \frac{1}{3} - \arctan \frac{1}{4} - \arctan \frac{1}{5} \right) \\

\end{align*}so $n = \boxed{47}.$
We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 & -1 \\ 7 & 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix} &= 2 \begin{vmatrix} 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix} + (-1) \begin{vmatrix} 7 & 4 \\ 2 & 2 \end{vmatrix} \\

The graph covers three periods in an interval of $2 \pi$ (say from $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $\frac{5 \pi}{2}$), so the period of the graph is $\frac{2 \pi}{3}.$  The period of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ is $\frac{2 \pi}{b},$ so $b = \boxed{3}.$
One way to compute $\det (\mathbf{A}^2 - 2 \mathbf{A})$ is to compute the matrix $\mathbf{A}^2 - 2 \mathbf{A},$ and then take its determinant
Another way is to write $\mathbf{A^2} - 2 \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A} (\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I}).$  Then
\begin{align*}
\det (\mathbf{A^2} - 2 \mathbf{A}) &= \det (\mathbf{A} (\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I})) \\
&= \det (\mathbf{A}) \det (\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I}) \\
&= \det \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 2 & 1 \\ \end{pmatrix} \det \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 3 \\ 2 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= (1 - 6)(1 - 6) = \boxed{25}.
\end{align*}
We can write
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin 18^\circ \cos 12^\circ + \cos 162^\circ \cos 102^\circ}{\sin 22^\circ \cos 8^\circ + \cos 158^\circ \cos 98^\circ} &= \frac{\sin 18^\circ \cos 12^\circ + \cos 18^\circ \cos 78^\circ}{\sin 22^\circ \cos 8^\circ + \cos 22^\circ \cos 82^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\sin 18^\circ \cos 12^\circ + \cos 18^\circ \sin 12^\circ}{\sin 22^\circ \cos 8^\circ + \cos 22^\circ \sin 8^\circ}.
\end{align*}Then from the angle addition formula,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin 18^\circ \cos 12^\circ + \cos 18^\circ \sin 12^\circ}{\sin 22^\circ \cos 8^\circ + \cos 22^\circ \sin 8^\circ} &= \frac{\sin (18^\circ + 12^\circ)}{\sin (22^\circ + 8^\circ)} \\
&= \frac{\sin 30^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ} = \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
Since $AP:PB = 2:7,$ we can write
\[\frac{\overrightarrow{P} - \overrightarrow{A}}{2} = \frac{\overrightarrow{B} - \overrightarrow{P}}{7}.\]Isolating $\overrightarrow{P},$ we find
\[\overrightarrow{P} = \frac{7}{9} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{2}{9} \overrightarrow{B}.\]Thus, $(t,u) = \boxed{\left( \frac{7}{9}, \frac{2}{9} \right)}.$
The direction vector of the line is $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.$  The projection of $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ onto the line is then
\[\frac{\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{8}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 8/3 \\ 4/3 \\ -4/3 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Consider $A$ and $B$ as fixed points in the plane

Then $\angle A$ is maximized when $\overline{AC}$ is tangent to the circle
In this case, $\angle C = 90^\circ,$ so by Pythagoras,
\[AC = \sqrt{20^2 - 15^2} = 5 \sqrt{7}.\]Then $\tan A = \frac{15}{5 \sqrt{7}} = \boxed{\frac{3 \sqrt{7}}{7}}.$
From the angle addition formula, the expression is equal to $\sin ((x - y) + y) = \boxed{\sin x}.$
We have that
\[\sec 120^\circ = \frac{1}{\cos 120^\circ}.\]Then $\cos 120^\circ = -\cos (120^\circ - 180^\circ) = -\cos (-60^\circ) = -\cos 60^\circ = -\frac{1}{2},$ so
\[\frac{1}{\cos 120^\circ} = \boxed{-2}.\]
For $\arccos (x^2)$ to be defined, we must have $-1 \le x^2 \le 1,$ which is satisfied only for $-1 \le x \le 1.$  Then $\arccos (x^2)$ will always return an angle between 0 and $\frac{\pi}{2}.$  Then $\tan (\arccos(x^2))$ is defined, unless $\arccos(x^2) = \frac{\pi}{2}.$  This occurs only when $x = 0.$
Therefore, the domain of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{[-1,0) \cup (0,1]}.$
From $r = \frac{1}{1 - \cos \theta},$
\[r - r \cos \theta = 1.\]Then $r = 1 + r \cos \theta = x + 1,$ so
\[r^2 = (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1.\]Hence, $x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1,$ so
\[y^2 = 2x + 1.\]This represents the graph of a parabola, so the answer is $\boxed{\text{(C)}}.$

From $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{b}\| = 2 \|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{a}\|,$
\[\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{b}\|^2 = 4 \|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{a}\|^2.\]This expands as
\[\|\mathbf{p}\|^2 - 2 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{p} + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 = 4 \|\mathbf{p}\|^2 - 8 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{p} + 4 \|\mathbf{a}\|^2,\]which simplifies to $3 \|\mathbf{p}\|^2 = 8 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{p} - 2 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{p} - 4 \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2.$  Hence,
\[\|\mathbf{p}\|^2 = \frac{8}{3} \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{p} - \frac{2}{3} \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{p} - \frac{4}{3} \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + \frac{1}{3} \|\mathbf{b}\|^2.\]We want $\|\mathbf{p} - (t \mathbf{a} + u \mathbf{b})\|$ to be constant, which means $\|\mathbf{p} - t \mathbf{a} - u \mathbf{b}\|^2$ is constant
This expands as
\begin{align*}
\|\mathbf{p} - t \mathbf{a} - u \mathbf{b}\|^2 &= \|\mathbf{p}\|^2 + t^2 \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + u^2 \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 - 2t \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{p} - 2u \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{p} + 2tu \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} \\
&= \frac{8}{3} \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{p} - \frac{2}{3} \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{p} - \frac{4}{3} \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + \frac{1}{3} \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 \\
&\quad + t^2 \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + u^2 \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 - 2t \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{p} - 2u \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{p} + 2tu \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} \\
&= \left( \frac{8}{3} - 2t \right) \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{p} - \left( \frac{2}{3} + 2u \right) \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{p} \\
&\quad + \left( t^2 - \frac{4}{3} \right) \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + \left( u^2 + \frac{1}{3} \right) \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 + 2tu \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}.
\end{align*}The only non-constant terms in this expression are $\left( \frac{8}{3} - 2t \right) \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{p}$ and $\left( \frac{2}{3} + 2u \right) \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{p}.$  We can them make them equal 0 by setting $2t = \frac{8}{3}$ and $2u = -\frac{2}{3}.$  These lead to $t = \frac{4}{3}$ and $u = -\frac{1}{3},$ so $(t,u) = \boxed{\left( \frac{4}{3}, -\frac{1}{3} \right)}.$

By SSS congruence, triangle $BAD_1$ and $BAD_2$ are congruent, so $\angle BAD_1 = \angle BAD_2.$  Let $\theta = \angle BAD_1 = \angle BAD_2.$  Let $s = \sqrt{111}$ and $r = \sqrt{11}.$
By the Law of Cosines on triangle $ACE_1,$
\[r^2 = CE_1^2 = 2s^2 - 2s^2 \cos \theta.\]By the Law of Cosines on triangle $ACE_2,$
\begin{align*}
CE_2^2 &= 2s^2 - 2s^2 \cos (120^\circ - \theta) \\
&= 2s^2 - 2s^2 \cos (240^\circ + \theta).
\end{align*}By the Law of Cosines on triangle $ACE_3,$
\[CE_3^2 = 2s^2 - 2s^2 \cos \theta.\]By the Law of Cosines on triangle $ACE_4,$
\[CE_2^2 = 2s^2 - 2s^2 \cos (120^\circ + \theta).\]Note that
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta + \cos (120^\circ + \theta) + \cos (240^\circ + \theta) &= \cos \theta + \cos 120^\circ \cos \theta - \sin 120^\circ \sin \theta + \cos 240^\circ \cos \theta - \sin 240^\circ \sin \theta \\
&= \cos \theta - \frac{1}{2} \cos \theta - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin \theta - \frac{1}{2} \cos \theta + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin \theta \\
\end{align*}so
\begin{align*}
CE_1^2 + CE_2^2 + CE_3^2 + CE_4^2 &= 2s^2 - 2s^2 \cos \theta + 2s^2 - 2s^2 \cos (240^\circ + \theta) \\
&\quad + 2s^2 - 2s^2 \cos \theta + 2s^2 - 2s^2 \cos (120^\circ + \theta) \\
&= 8s^2 - 2s^2 \cos \theta.
\end{align*}Since $2s^2 \cos^2 \theta = 2s^2 - r^2,$
\[8s^2 - 2s^2 \cos \theta = 8s^2 - (2s^2 - r^2) = r^2 + 6s^2 = \boxed{677}.\]
Use the two trigonometric Pythagorean identities $1 + \tan^2 x = \sec^2 x$ and $1 + \cot^2 x = \csc^2 x$.
If we square the given $\sec x = \frac{22}{7} - \tan x$, we find that
\begin{align*} \sec^2 x &= \left(\frac{22}7\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{22}7\right)\tan x + \tan^2 x \\ 1 &= \left(\frac{22}7\right)^2 - \frac{44}7 \tan x \end{align*}
This yields $\tan x = \frac{435}{308}$.
Let $y = \frac mn$
Then squaring,
\[\csc^2 x = (y - \cot x)^2 \Longrightarrow 1 = y^2 - 2y\cot x.\]
Substituting $\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x} = \frac{308}{435}$ yields a quadratic equation: $0 = 435y^2 - 616y - 435 = (15y - 29)(29y + 15)$
It turns out that only the positive root will work, so the value of $y = \frac{29}{15}$ and $m + n = \boxed{44}$.
From the givens, $2\sin t \cos t + 2 \sin t + 2 \cos t = \frac{1}{2}$, and adding $\sin^2 t + \cos^2t = 1$ to both sides gives $(\sin t + \cos t)^2 + 2(\sin t + \cos t) = \frac{3}{2}$
Completing the square on the left in the variable $(\sin t + \cos t)$ gives $\sin t + \cos t = -1 \pm \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}$
Since $|\sin t + \cos t| \leq \sqrt 2 < 1 + \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}$, we have $\sin t + \cos t = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} - 1$
Subtracting twice this from our original equation gives $(\sin t - 1)(\cos t - 1) = \sin t \cos t - \sin t - \cos t + 1 = \frac{13}{4} - \sqrt{10}$, so the answer is $13 + 4 + 10 = \boxed{27}$.
Note that $\frac{\sum_{n=1}^{44} \cos n}{\sum_{n=1}^{44} \sin n} = \frac {\cos 1 + \cos 2 + \dots + \cos 44}{\cos 89 + \cos 88 + \dots + \cos 46}$
Now use the sum-product formula $\cos x + \cos y = 2\cos(\frac{x+y}{2})\cos(\frac{x-y}{2})$ We want to pair up $[1, 44]$, $[2, 43]$, $[3, 42]$, etc
from the numerator and $[46, 89]$, $[47, 88]$, $[48, 87]$ etc
from the denominator
Then we get:\[\frac{\sum_{n=1}^{44} \cos n}{\sum_{n=1}^{44} \sin n} = \frac{2\cos(\frac{45}{2})[\cos(\frac{43}{2})+\cos(\frac{41}{2})+\dots+\cos(\frac{1}{2})}{2\cos(\frac{135}{2})[\cos(\frac{43}{2})+\cos(\frac{41}{2})+\dots+\cos(\frac{1}{2})} \Rightarrow \frac{\cos(\frac{45}{2})}{\cos(\frac{135}{2})}\]
To calculate this number, use the half angle formula
Since $\cos(\frac{x}{2}) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{\cos x + 1}{2}}$, then our number becomes:\[\frac{\sqrt{\frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + 1}{2}}}{\sqrt{\frac{\frac{-\sqrt{2}}{2} + 1}{2}}}\]in which we drop the negative roots (as it is clear cosine of $22.5$ and $67.5$ are positive)
We can easily simplify this:
\begin{eqnarray*} \frac{\sqrt{\frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + 1}{2}}}{\sqrt{\frac{\frac{-\sqrt{2}}{2} + 1}{2}}} &=& \sqrt{\frac{\frac{2+\sqrt{2}}{4}}{\frac{2-\sqrt{2}}{4}}} \\ &=& \sqrt{\frac{2+\sqrt{2}}{2-\sqrt{2}}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2+\sqrt{2}}{2+\sqrt{2}}} \\ &=& \sqrt{\frac{(2+\sqrt{2})^2}{2}} \\ &=& \frac{2+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{2} \\ &=& \sqrt{2}+1 \end{eqnarray*}
And hence our answer is $\lfloor 100x \rfloor =  \lfloor 100(1 + \sqrt {2}) \rfloor = \boxed{241}$.
Let $s = \sum_{k=1}^{35}\sin 5k  = \sin 5 + \sin 10 + \ldots + \sin 175$
We could try to manipulate this sum by wrapping the terms around (since the first half is equal to the second half), but it quickly becomes apparent that this way is difficult to pull off
Instead, we look to telescope the sum
Using the identity $\sin a \sin b = \frac 12(\cos (a-b) - \cos (a+b))$, we can rewrite $s$ as
\begin{align*} s \cdot \sin 5 = \sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k \sin 5 &= \sum_{k=1}^{35} \frac{1}{2}(\cos (5k - 5)- \cos (5k + 5))\\ &= \frac{0.5(\cos 0 - \cos 10 + \cos 5 - \cos 15 + \cos 10 \ldots + \cos 165 - \cos 175+ \cos 170 - \cos 180)}{\sin 5}\end{align*}
This telescopes to\[s = \frac{\cos 0 + \cos 5 - \cos 175 - \cos 180}{2 \sin 5} = \frac{1 + \cos 5}{\sin 5}.\]Manipulating this to use the identity $\tan x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{\sin 2x}$, we get\[s = \frac{1 - \cos 175}{\sin 175} \Longrightarrow s = \tan \frac{175}{2},\]and our answer is $\boxed{177}$.
Using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify the first equation to $\log_{10} \sin x + \log_{10} \cos x = \log_{10}(\sin x \cos x) = -1$
Therefore,\[\sin x \cos x = \frac{1}{10}.\qquad (*)\]
Now, manipulate the second equation.\begin{align*} \log_{10} (\sin x + \cos x) &= \frac{1}{2}(\log_{10} n - \log_{10} 10) \\ \log_{10} (\sin x + \cos x) &= \left(\log_{10} \sqrt{\frac{n}{10}}\right) \\ \sin x + \cos x &= \sqrt{\frac{n}{10}} \\ (\sin x + \cos x)^{2} &= \left(\sqrt{\frac{n}{10}}\right)^2 \\ \sin^2 x + \cos^2 x +2 \sin x \cos x &= \frac{n}{10} \\ \end{align*}
By the Pythagorean identities, $\sin ^2 x + \cos ^2 x = 1$, and we can substitute the value for $\sin x \cos x$ from $(*)$
$1 + 2\left(\frac{1}{10}\right) = \frac{n}{10} \Longrightarrow n = \boxed{12}$.
Observe that $2\cos 4x\cos x = \cos 5x + \cos 3x$ by the sum-to-product formulas
Defining $a = \cos 3x$ and $b = \cos 5x$, we have $a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)^3 \rightarrow ab(a+b) = 0$
But $a+b = 2\cos 4x\cos x$, so we require $\cos x = 0$, $\cos 3x = 0$, $\cos 4x = 0$, or $\cos 5x = 0$.
Hence we see by careful analysis of the cases that the solution set is $A = \{150, 126, 162, 198, 112.5, 157.5\}$ and thus $\sum_{x \in A} x = \boxed{906}$.
By the product-to-sum identities, we have that $2\cos a \sin b = \sin (a+b) - \sin (a-b)$
Therefore, this reduces to a telescoping series:\begin{align*} \sum_{k=1}^{n} 2\cos(k^2a)\sin(ka) &= \sum_{k=1}^{n} [\sin(k(k+1)a) - \sin((k-1)ka)]\\ &= -\sin(0) + \sin(2a)- \sin(2a) + \sin(6a) - \cdots - \sin((n-1)na) + \sin(n(n+1)a)\\ &= -\sin(0) + \sin(n(n+1)a) = \sin(n(n+1)a) \end{align*}
Thus, we need $\sin \left(\frac{n(n+1)\pi}{2008}\right)$ to be an integer; this can be only $\{-1,0,1\}$, which occur when $2 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2008}$ is an integer
Thus $1004 = 2^2 \cdot 251 | n(n+1) \Longrightarrow 251 | n, n+1$
It easily follows that $n = \boxed{251}$ is the smallest such integer.
By the product-to-sum identities, we know that $2\sin a \sin b = \cos(a-b) - \cos(a+b)$, so $2\sin{x}\sin{1} = \cos(x-1)-\cos(x+1)$: $\sum_{x=2}^{44} [\cos(x-1) - \cos(x+1)][1 + \sec (x-1) \sec (x+1)]\\ =\sum_{x=2}^{44} \cos(x-1) - \cos(x+1) + \frac{1}{\cos(x+1)} - \frac{1}{\cos(x-1)}\\ =\sum_{x=2}^{44} \frac{\cos^2(x-1)-1}{\cos(x-1)} - \frac{\cos^2(x+1)-1}{\cos(x+1)}\\ =\sum_{x=2}^{44} \left(\frac{\sin^2(x+1)}{\cos(x+1)}\right) - \left(\frac{\sin^2(x-1)}{\cos(x-1)}\right)$
This sum telescopes (in other words, when we expand the sum, all of the intermediate terms will cancel) to $-\frac{\sin^2(1)}{\cos(1)} -\frac{\sin^2(2)}{\cos(2)} + \frac{\sin^2(44)}{\cos(44)} + \frac{\sin^2(45)}{\cos(45)}$
We now have the desired four terms
There are a couple of ways to express $\Phi,\,\Psi$ as primitive trigonometric functions; for example, if we move a $\sin$ to the denominator, we could express it as $\Phi(x) = \sin(x),\, \Psi(x) = \cot(x)$
Either way, we have $\{\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3,\theta_4\} = \{1^{\circ},2^{\circ},44^{\circ},45^{\circ}\}$, and the answer is $1+2+44+45 = \boxed{92}$.
If the product is $0$, then one of the factors $(1 + e^{2 \pi i k / n})^n + 1$ is $0$
This means that
\[(1 + e^{2 \pi i k / n})^n = -1,\]which tells us that $  1 + e^{2 \pi i k / n} $ has magnitude $1$, meaning it is on the unit circle
If we translate it to the left by subtracting $1$, we get $e^{2 \pi i k / n} $ which will also be on the unit circle, and hence have magnitude $1$.
We can visualize this as the three complex numbers $-1$, $0$, and $e^{2 \pi i k / n}$ forming the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length $1$
So $e^{2 \pi i k / n}$ is either $e^{2 \pi i / 3}$ or its conjugate
This means that $  1 + e^{2 \pi i k / n} $ is either $ e^{ \pi i / 3} $ or its conjugate, which tells us that $( 1 + e^{2 \pi i k / n})^n$ is either $ e^{ n \pi i / 3} $ or its conjugate
The only way this can be $-1$ is if $n$ is an odd multiple of $3$, and in this case, the factor corresponding to $k=n/3$ will be zero.
So the problem becomes counting the odd multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $2012$
Since $2010 = 3\cdot 670$ there are $670$ multiples of $3$ in this interval, half of which must be odd
Our answer is $\boxed{335}$.
The cross product of $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 2 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ is
\[\begin{pmatrix} (2)(3) - (1)(-6) \\ (-6)(1) - (3)(5) \\ (5)(1) - (1)(2) \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 12 \\ -21 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
From the double angle formula,
\[\sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cdot (1 + \cos \theta) = \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \left( 2 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} \right) = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \left( 1 - \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} \right).\]Let $x = \sin \frac{\theta}{2}.$  We want to maximize
\[y = 2x (1 - x^2).\]Note that
\[y^2 = 4x^2 (1 - x^2)(1 - x^2).\]By AM-GM,
\[2x^2 (1 - x^2)(1 - x^2) \le \left( \frac{2x^2 + (1 - x^2) + (1 - x^2)}{3} \right)^3 = \frac{8}{27},\]so
\[y^2 = 2 \cdot 2x^2 (1 - x^2)(1 - x^2) \le \frac{16}{27}.\]Then $y \le \sqrt{\frac{16}{27}} = \frac{4 \sqrt{3}}{9}.$
Equality occurs when $2x^2 = 1 - x^2,$ or $x = \frac{1}{3},$ which means $\theta = 2 \arcsin \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.$  Hence, the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{4 \sqrt{3}}{9}}.$
Since the projection of $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ is $\begin{pmatrix} \frac{3}{2} \\ -\frac{3}{2} \end{pmatrix},$ the vector being projected onto is a scalar multiple of $\begin{pmatrix} \frac{3}{2} \\ -\frac{3}{2} \end{pmatrix}.$  Thus, we can assume that the vector being projected onto is $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.$

Thus, the projection of $\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is
\[\operatorname{proj}_{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{-5}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -5/2 \\ 5/2 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We see that
\[1 - i \sqrt{3} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i \right) = 2e^{5 \pi i/3},\]so $\theta = \boxed{\frac{5\pi}{3}}$.
We know that $\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=\|\mathbf{a}\|\cdot\|\mathbf{b}\|\cdot\cos \theta =7\cdot 11\cdot\cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$
The range of values of $\cos \theta$ is $[-1,1]$, so the range of values of $\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}$ is $\boxed{[-77,77]}$.
Since the determinant is $(6)(2) - (-4)(-3) = 0,$ the inverse does not exist, so the answer is the zero matrix $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}}.$
From the equation $\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{b}\|,$ $\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{b}\|^2,$ so
\[(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}.\]Expanding, we get $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b},$ so
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0.\]We can write this as $\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{b}) = 0.$  Thus, the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{b}$ are orthogonal, and the angle between them is $\boxed{90^\circ}.$
Let $r$ be the common ratio
Since $0 < \alpha < \frac{\pi}{2},$ both $\arcsin (\sin \alpha)$ and $\arcsin (\sin 2 \alpha)$ are positive, so $r$ is positive
The positive portions of the graphs of $y = \arcsin (\sin x),$ $y = \arcsin (2 \sin x),$ and $y = \arcsin (7 \sin x)$ are shown below
(Note that each graph is piece-wise linear.)

Note that $\arcsin (\sin x) = x.$  If $0 < x \le \frac{\pi}{4},$ then
\[\arcsin (\sin 2x) = 2x,\]and if $\frac{\pi}{4} \le x < \frac{\pi}{2},$ then
\[\arcsin (\sin 2x) = \pi - 2x.\]If $0 < x \le \frac{\pi}{14},$ then
\[\arcsin (\sin 7x) = 7x.\]The first three terms become $x,$ $2x,$ $7x,$ which cannot form a geometric progression.
If $\frac{\pi}{14} \le x \le \frac{\pi}{7},$ then
\[\arcsin (\sin 7x) = \pi - 7x.\]The first three terms become $x,$ $2x,$ $\pi - 7x.$  If these form a geometric progression, then
\[(2x)^2 = x(\pi - 7x).\]Solving, we find $x = \frac{\pi}{11}.$  The common ratio $r$ is then 2, and the fourth term is
\[2^3 \cdot \frac{\pi}{11} = \frac{8 \pi}{11}.\]But this is greater than $\frac{\pi}{2},$ so this case is not possible.
If $\frac{2 \pi}{7} \le x \le \frac{5 \pi}{14},$ then
\[\arcsin (\sin 7x) = 7 \left( x - \frac{2 \pi}{7} \right) = 7x - 2 \pi.\]The first three terms become $x,$ $\pi - 2x,$ $7x - 2 \pi.$  If these form a geometric progression, then
\[(\pi - 2x)^2 = x(7x - 2 \pi).\]This simplifies to $3x^2 + 2 \pi x - \pi^2 = 0,$ which factors as $(3x - \pi)(x + \pi) = 0.$  Hence, $x = \frac{\pi}{3}.$  The common ratio $r$ is then 1, and the smallest $t$ such that $\arcsin \left( \sin \left( t \cdot \frac{\pi}{3} \right) \right) = \frac{\pi}{3}$ is 1.
Finally, if $\frac{5 \pi}{14} \le x \le \frac{3 \pi}{7},$ then
\[\arcsin (\sin 7x) = -7 \left( x - \frac{3 \pi}{7} \right) = -7x + 3 \pi.\]The first three terms become $x,$ $\pi - 2x,$ $-7x + 3 \pi.$  If these form a geometric progression, then
\[(\pi - 2x)^2 = x (-7x + 3 \pi).\]This simplifies to $11x^2 - 7 \pi x + \pi^2 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,
\[x = \frac{(7 \pm \sqrt{5}) \pi}{22}.\]For $x = \frac{(7 - \sqrt{5}) \pi}{22},$ both the second and third term are greater than $\frac{\pi}{2}.$  For $x = \frac{(7 + \sqrt{5}) \pi}{22},$ the common ratio $r$ is
\[\frac{\pi - 2x}{x} = \frac{\pi}{x} - 2 = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2},\]so the fourth term is
\[x \cdot r^3 = x \cdot \left( \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^3 = (9 - 4 \sqrt{5}) x.\]The smallest $t$ such that $\arcsin (\sin tx) = (9 - 4 \sqrt{5}) x$ is $t = \boxed{9 - 4 \sqrt{5}},$ and this is the smallest possible value of $t.$
We start with the addition formula for tangent:
\[\tan (a + b) = \frac{\tan a + \tan b}{1 - \tan a \tan b}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\cot (a + b) &= \frac{1}{\tan (a + b)} \\
&= \frac{1 - \tan a \tan b}{\tan a + \tan b} \\
&= \frac{\frac{1}{\tan a \tan b} - 1}{\frac{1}{\tan a} + \frac{1}{\tan b}} \\
&= \frac{\cot a \cot b - 1}{\cot a + \cot b}.
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
\cot (a + b + c) &= \cot ((a + b) + c) \\
&= \frac{\cot (a + b) \cot c - 1}{\cot (a + b) + \cot c} \\
&= \frac{\frac{\cot a \cot b - 1}{\cot a + \cot b} \cdot \cot c - 1}{\frac{\cot a \cot b - 1}{\cot a + \cot b} + \cot c} \\
&= \frac{\cot a \cot b \cot c - (\cot a + \cot b + \cot c)}{(\cot a \cot b + \cot a \cot c + \cot b \cot c) - 1}.
\end{align*}More generally, we can prove that
\[\cot (a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n) = \frac{s_n - s_{n - 2} + \dotsb}{s_{n - 1} - s_{n - 3} + \dotsb},\]where $s_k$ is the sum of the products of the $\cot a_i,$ taken $k$ at a time
(In the numerator, the terms are $s_n,$ $s_{n - 2},$ $s_{n - 4},$ $s_{n - 6},$ $\dots,$ and the signs alternate
The numerator ends at $s_0 = 1$ or $s_1,$ depending on whether $n$ is even or odd
The terms in the denominator are similarly described.)
Let $a_i = \operatorname{arccot} z_i.$  Then
\[\cot (a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{20}) = \frac{s_{20} - s_{18} + \dots - s_2 + 1}{s_{19} - s_{17} + \dots + s_3 - s_1}.\]By Vieta's formulas, $s_1 = 2^2,$ $s_2 = 3^2,$ $s_3 = 4^2,$ $\dots,$ $s_{19} = 20^2,$ and $s_{20} = 21^2.$  Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\cot (a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{20}) &= \frac{s_{20} - s_{18} + \dots - s_2 + 1}{s_{19} - s_{17} + \dots + s_3 - s_1} \\
&= \frac{21^2 - 19^2 + 17^2 - 15^2 + \dots + 5^2 - 3^2 + 1}{20^2 - 18^2 + 16^2 - 14^2 + \dots + 4^2 - 2^2} \\
&= \frac{(21 - 19)(21 + 19) + (17 - 15)(17 + 15) + \dots + (5 - 3)(5 + 3) + 1}{(20 - 18)(20 + 18) + (16 - 14)(16 + 14) + \dots + (4 - 2)(4 + 2)} \\
&= \frac{2(21 + 19 + 17 + 15 + \dots + 5 + 3) + 1}{2(20 + 18 + 16 + 14 + \dots + 4 + 2)} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{241}{220}}.
\end{align*}
Since $\mathbf{a}$ and $-\mathbf{a}$ point in opposite directions, the angle between them is $180^\circ.$  Then the angle between $-\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is $180^\circ - 43^\circ = \boxed{137^\circ}.$

Then $AC_k = |2 - 2 \omega^k| = 2 |1 - \omega^k|$ and
\[BC_k = |-2 - 2 \omega_k| = 2 |1 + \omega^k|.\]Since $\omega^7 = -1,$ we can also write this as
\[BC_k = 2 |1 - \omega^{k + 7}|.\]Therefore,
\[AC_1 \cdot AC_2 \dotsm AC_6 = 2^6 |(1 - \omega)(1 - \omega^2) \dotsm (1 - \omega^6)|\]and
\[BC_1 \cdot BC_2 \dotsm BC_6 = 2^6 |(1 - \omega^8)(1 - \omega^9) \dotsm (1 - \omega^{13})|.\]Note that 1, $\omega,$ $\omega^2,$ $\dots,$ $\omega^{13}$ are all roots of $z^{14} - 1 = 0.$  Thus
\[z^{14} - 1 = (z - 1)(z - \omega)(z - \omega^2) \dotsm (z - \omega^{13}).\]One factor on the right is $z - 1,$ and another factor on the right is $z - \omega^7 = z + 1.$  Thus,
\[z^{14} - 1 = (z - 1)(z + 1) \cdot (z - \omega)(z - \omega^2) \dotsm (z - \omega^6)(z - \omega^8)(z - \omega^9) \dotsm (z - \omega^{13}).\]Since $z^{14} - 1 = (z^2 - 1)(z^{12} + z^{10} + z^8 + \dots + 1),$ we can write
\[z^{12} + z^{10} + z^8 + \dots + 1 = (z - \omega)(z - \omega^2) \dotsm (z - \omega^6)(z - \omega^8)(z - \omega^9) \dotsm (z - \omega^{13}).\]Setting $z = 1,$ we get
\[7 = (1 - \omega)(1 - \omega^2) \dotsm (1 - \omega^6)(1 - \omega^8)(1 - \omega^9) \dotsm (1 - \omega^{13}).\]Therefore,
\begin{align*}
&AC_1 \cdot AC_2 \dotsm AC_6 \cdot BC_1 \cdot BC_2 \dotsm BC_6 \\
&= 2^6 |(1 - \omega)(1 - \omega^2) \dotsm (1 - \omega^6)| \cdot 2^6 |(1 - \omega^8)(1 - \omega^9) \dotsm (1 - \omega^{13})| \\
&= 2^{12} |(1 - \omega)(1 - \omega^2) \dotsm (1 - \omega^6)(1 - \omega^8)(1 - \omega^9) \dotsm (1 - \omega^{13})| \\
&= 7 \cdot 2^{12} \\
&= \boxed{28672}.

Note that right triangles $OQP$ and $OPV$ are similar, so

The volume of the parallelepiped generated by $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix},$ $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ k \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ k \end{pmatrix}$ is given by the absolute value of the determinant
\[\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 \\ 3 & k & 2 \\ 4 & 2 & k \end{vmatrix}.\]We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 \\ 3 & k & 2 \\ 4 & 2 & k \end{vmatrix} &= 2 \begin{vmatrix} k & 2 \\ 2 & k \end{vmatrix} - \begin{vmatrix} 3 & 2 \\ 4 & k \end{vmatrix} + \begin{vmatrix} 3 & k \\ 4 & 2 \end{vmatrix} \\
&= 2(k^2 - 4) - (3k - 8) + (6 - 4k) \\
&= 2k^2 - 7k + 6.
\end{align*}Thus, the volume of the parallelepiped is $|2k^2 - 7k + 6| = 15.$  The solutions to $2k^2 - 7k + 6 = 15$ are $k = -1$ and $k = \frac{9}{2}.$  The equation $2k^2 - 7k + 6 = -15$ has no real solutions
Since $k > 0,$ $k = \boxed{\frac{9}{2}}.$
Let $\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix}.$  Then

Let $z_n = a_n + b_n i.$  Then
\begin{align*}
z_{n + 1} &= (a_n \sqrt{3} - b_n) + (b_n \sqrt{3} + a_n) i \\
&= a_n (\sqrt{3} + i) + b_n (i \sqrt{3} - 1) \\
&= a_n (\sqrt{3} + i) + b_n i (\sqrt{3} + i) \\
&= (\sqrt{3} + i)(a_n + b_n i) \\\
&= (\sqrt{3} + i) z_n.
\end{align*}Hence, $z_{100} = (\sqrt{3} + i)^{99} z_1.$  To evaluate this expression, we write
\[\sqrt{3} + i = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} i \right) = 2 \operatorname{cis} 30^\circ.\]Then
\[(\sqrt{3} + i)^{99} = 2^{99} \operatorname{cis} 2970^\circ = 2^{99} \operatorname{cis} 90^\circ = 2^{99} i.\]Since $z_{100} = 2 + 4i,$
\[z_1 = \frac{2 + 4i}{2^{99} i} = \frac{4 - 2i}{2^{99}} = \frac{2 - i}{2^{98}},\]so
\[a_1 + b_1 = \frac{2}{2^{98}} - \frac{1}{2^{98}} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2^{98}}}.\]
We can distribute, to get
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{M} (\mathbf{v} + 3 \mathbf{w}) &= \mathbf{M} \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{M} (3 \mathbf{w}) \\
&= \mathbf{M} \mathbf{v} + 3 \mathbf{M} \mathbf{w} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} + 3 \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -12 \end{pmatrix}}.
\end{align*}
Since $AP:PB = 3:2,$ we can write
\[\frac{\overrightarrow{P} - \overrightarrow{A}}{3} = \frac{\overrightarrow{B} - \overrightarrow{P}}{2}.\]Isolating $\overrightarrow{P},$ we find
\[\overrightarrow{P} = \frac{2}{5} \overrightarrow{A} + \frac{3}{5} \overrightarrow{B}.\]Thus, $(t,u) = \boxed{\left( \frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \right)}.$
We see that
\[\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 8 \end{pmatrix} = (-4) \cdot 6 + (-1) \cdot 8 = \boxed{-32}.\]
Let $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}.$  Then the equation $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 11$ gives us $2x + y + 5z = 11.$  Also,
\[\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5y + z \\ 5x - 2z \\ -x + 2y \end{pmatrix}.\]Comparing entries, we obtain
\begin{align*}
-5y + z &= -13, \\
5x - 2z &= -9, \\
-x + 2y &= 7.
\end{align*}Solving this system, along with the equation $2x + y + z = 5z = 11,$ we find $x = -1,$ $y = 3,$ and $z = 2.$  Hence, $\mathbf{b} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}.$
The functions $\sin x,$ $\cos x,$ $\tan x$ are one-to-one on the interval $(0^\circ,90^\circ).$  Since Malvina could deduce her function, the value of $x$ can also be deduced
In particular, $\sin x,$ $\cos x,$ and $\tan x$ are all known
Since they cannot deduce Paulina's function and Georgina's function, their values must be equal.
If $\sin x = \cos x,$ then $\tan x = 1,$ so $x = 45^\circ.$  Then Malvina's value is 1.
If $\sin x = \tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x},$ then $\cos x = 1.$  But $\cos x$ cannot achieve 1 on the interval $(0^\circ,90^\circ).$
If $\cos x = \tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x},$ then $\sin x = \cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x.$  Then
\[\sin^2 x + \sin x - 1 = 0.\]By the quadratic formula,
\[\sin x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]Since $-1 \le \sin x \le 1,$
\[\sin x = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]This is the case where $\cos x = \tan x,$ so Malvina's value is $\sin x = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.$
Therefore, the sum of the possible numbers on Malvina's card is
\[1 + \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}.\]
Let $P = (a,b,c).$  If the point $(x,y,z)$ is equidistant to $(1,2,-5)$ and $(a,b,c),$ then
\[(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z + 5)^2 = (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2.\]Expanding, we get
\[x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 - 4y + 4 + z^2 + 10z + 25 = x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 + z^2 - 2cz + c^2,\]which simplifies to
\[(2a - 2) x + (2b - 4) y + (2c + 10) z = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 30.\]We want this to coincide with the equation
\[10x - 4y + 24z = 55.\]If we set $2a - 2 = 10,$ $2b - 4 = -4,$ and $2c + 10 = 24,$ then $a = 6,$ $b = 0,$ and $c = 7.$  Note that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 30 = 55,$ so these values work
Thus, $(a,b,c) = \boxed{(6,0,7)}.$
We have that $\rho = \sqrt{0^2 + (-3 \sqrt{3})^2 + 3^2} = 6.$  We want $\phi$ to satisfy
\[3 = 6 \cos \phi,\]so $\phi = \frac{\pi}{3}.$
We want $\theta$ to satisfy
\begin{align*}
0 &= 6 \sin \frac{\pi}{3} \cos \theta, \\
-3 \sqrt{3} &= 6 \sin \frac{\pi}{3} \sin \theta.
\end{align*}Thus, $\theta = \frac{3 \pi}{2},$ so the spherical coordinates are $\boxed{\left( 6, \frac{3 \pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{3} \right)}.$
Note that $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 9 \end{pmatrix}$ are two points on this line, so a possible direction vector is
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 9 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.\]Then any nonzero scalar multiple of $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$ can also be a direction vector.
The form
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{v} + t \mathbf{d}\]parameterizes a line if and only if $\mathbf{v}$ lies on the line, and $\mathbf{d}$ is a possible direction vector for the line
Checking, we find that the possible parameterizations are $\boxed{\text{B,E}}.$
We can factor the numerator, and write the denominator in terms of $\sin A$ and $\cos A,$ to get
\begin{align*}
f(A) &= \frac{\sin A (3 \cos^2 A + \cos^4 A + 3 \sin^2 A + \sin^2 A \cos^2 A)}{\tan A (\sec A - \sin A \tan A)} \\
&= \frac{\sin A (\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A)(\cos^2 A + 3)}{\frac{\sin A}{\cos A} (\frac{1}{\cos A} - \frac{\sin^2 A}{\cos A})} \\
&= \frac{\sin A (\cos^2 A + 3)}{\frac{\sin A}{\cos A} \cdot \frac{1 - \sin^2 A}{\cos A}} \\
&= \frac{\sin A (\cos^2 A + 3)}{\frac{\sin A}{\cos A} \cdot \frac{\cos^2 A}{\cos A}} \\
&= \cos^2 A + 3.
\end{align*}The range of $\cos^2 A$ is $(0,1).$  (Note that 0 and 1 are not included, since $A$ cannot be an integer multiple of $\frac{\pi}{2}.$)  Hence, the range of $f(A) = \cos^2 A + 3$ is $\boxed{(3,4)}.$
Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, the midpoints of diagonals $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ coincide.

The midpoint of $\overline{AC}$ is
\[\left( \frac{3 + (-1)}{2}, \frac{(-1) + 1}{2}, \frac{2 + 2}{2} \right) = (1,0,2).\]This is also the midpoint of $\overline{BD},$ so the coordinates of $D$ are
\[(2 \cdot 1 - 1, 2 \cdot 0 - 2, 2 \cdot 2 - (-4)) = \boxed{(1,-2,8)}.\]
The second equation is equivalent to $\frac1{\tan x} + \frac1{\tan y} = 30,$ or $\frac{\tan x + \tan y}{\tan x \tan y} = 30.$ Thus, $\frac{25}{\tan x \tan y} = 30,$ so $\tan x \tan y = \frac{25}{30} = \frac{5}{6}.$ Then from the angle addition formula,
\[\tan(x+y) = \frac{\tan x+ \tan y}{1 - \tan x \tan y} = \frac{25}{1 - \frac{5}{6}} = \boxed{150}.\]
We have that $\cot 45^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 45^\circ} = \boxed{1}.$
The maximum value of $a \sin bx$ is $|a|,$ so $a = \boxed{-2}.$
Taking the sine of both sides, we get
\[\sin (\arcsin x + \arcsin (1 - x)) = \sin (\arccos x).\]Then from the angle addition formula,
\[\sin (\arcsin x) \cos (\arcsin (1 - x)) + \cos (\arcsin x) \sin (\arcsin (1 - x)) = \sin (\arccos x),\]or
\[x \sqrt{1 - (1 - x)^2} + \sqrt{1 - x^2} (1 - x) = \sqrt{1 - x^2}.\]Then
\[x \sqrt{1 - (1 - x)^2} = x \sqrt{1 - x^2}.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[x^2 (1 - (1 - x)^2) = x^2 (1 - x^2).\]This simplifies to $2x^3 - x^2 = x^2 (2x - 1) = 0.$  Thus, $x = 0$ or $x = \frac{1}{2}.$
Checking, we find both solutions work, so the solutions are $\boxed{0, \frac{1}{2}}.$
We have that
\begin{align*}
k &= (\sin \alpha + \csc \alpha)^2 + (\cos \alpha + \sec \alpha)^2 - \tan^2 \alpha - \cot^2 \alpha \\
&= \left( \sin \alpha + \frac{1}{\sin \alpha} \right)^2 + \left( \cos \alpha + \frac{1}{\cos \alpha} \right)^2 - \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\cos^2 \alpha} - \frac{\cos^2 \alpha}{\sin^2 \alpha} \\
&= \sin^2 \alpha + 2 + \frac{1}{\sin^2 \alpha} + \cos^2 \alpha + 2 + \frac{1}{\cos^2 \alpha} - \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\cos^2 \alpha} - \frac{\cos^2 \alpha}{\sin^2 \alpha} \\
&= 5 + \frac{1 - \sin^2 \alpha}{\cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1 - \cos^2 \alpha}{\sin^2 \alpha} \\
&= 5 + \frac{\cos^2 \alpha}{\cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\sin^2 \alpha} \\
&= \boxed{7}.
\end{align*}
In general, $\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is the first column of $\mathbf{M}$, and $\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is the second column of $\mathbf{M}.$
Taking $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},$ we get
\[-5 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.\]Taking $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},$ we get
\[-5 \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}.\]Therefore,
\[\mathbf{M} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -5 & 0 \\ 0 & -5 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Since the matrix is not invertible, its determinant is 0, i.e.
\[\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c \\ b & c & a \\ c & a & b \end{vmatrix} = 0.\]The determinant expands as
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c \\ b & c & a \\ c & a & b \end{vmatrix} &= a \begin{vmatrix} c & a \\ a & b \end{vmatrix} - b \begin{vmatrix} b & a \\ c & b \end{vmatrix} + c \begin{vmatrix} b & c \\ c & a \end{vmatrix} \\
&= a(bc - a^2) - b(b^2 - ac) + c(ab - c^2) \\
&= 3abc - a^3 - b^3 - c^3.
\end{align*}This factors as
\[3abc - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = -(a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc),\]so either $a + b + c = 0$ or $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc = 0.$
If $a + b + c = 0,$ then
\[\frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{a + c} + \frac{c}{a + b} = \frac{a}{-a} + \frac{b}{-b} + \frac{c}{-c} = -3.\]Now, suppose $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc = 0.$  Then
\begin{align*}
(a - b)^2 + (a - c)^2 + (b - c)^2 &= (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) + (a^2 - 2ac + c^2) + (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) \\
&= 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) \\
\end{align*}This forces $a = b = c,$ so
\[\frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{a + c} + \frac{c}{a + b} = \frac{3}{2}.\]Thus, the possible values of
\[\frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{a + c} + \frac{c}{a + b}\]are $\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$ and $\boxed{-3}.$
For a given angle of $\theta,$ the projectile lands when $y = 0,$ or
\[vt \sin \theta - \frac{1}{2} gt^2 = 0.\]The solutions are $t = 0$ and $t = \frac{2v \sin \theta}{g}.$  The top of the arch occurs at the half-way point, or
\[t = \frac{v \sin \theta}{g}.\]Then the highest point of the arch is given by
\begin{align*}
x &= tv \cos \theta = \frac{v^2}{g} \sin \theta \cos \theta, \\
y &= vt \sin \theta - \frac{1}{2} gt^2 = \frac{v^2}{2g} \sin^2 \theta.
\end{align*}By the double-angle formulas,
\[x = \frac{v^2}{2g} \sin 2 \theta,\]and
\[y = \frac{v^2}{2g} \cdot \frac{1 - \cos 2 \theta}{2} = \frac{v^2}{4g} - \frac{v^2}{4g} \cos 2 \theta.\]Hence, $x$ and $y$ satisfy
\[\frac{x^2}{(\frac{v^2}{2g})^2} + \frac{(y - \frac{v^2}{4g})^2}{(\frac{v^2}{4g})^2} = 1.\]Thus, the highest point of the arch traces an ellipse, with semi-axes $\frac{v^2}{2g}$ and $\frac{v^2}{4g}.$

Then the area of the ellipse is
\[\pi \cdot \frac{v^2}{2g} \cdot \frac{v^2}{4g} = \frac{\pi}{8} \cdot \frac{v^4}{g^2}.\]Thus, $c = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{8}}.$
Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers
If $a \ge b,$ then
\[|a + b| + |a - b| = (a + b) + (a - b) = 2a.\]If $a \le b,$ then
\[|a + b| + |a - b| = (a + b) + (b - a) = 2b.\]In either case, $|a + b| + |a - b| = 2 \max\{a,b\}.$
Thus, the condition $|x + y + z| + |x + y - z| \le 8$ is equivalent to
\[2 \max \{x + y, z\} \le 8,\]or $\max \{x + y, z\} \le 4.$  This is the intersection of the conditions $x + y \le 4$ and $z \le 4,$ so the region is as below.

This is a triangular prism with base $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 8,$ and height 4, so its volume is $8 \cdot 4 = \boxed{32}.$
To find a unit vector that is orthogonal to both $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},$ we take their cross product:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.\]This vector has magnitude 3, so we divide by 3 to get a unit vector: $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 2/3 \\ -2/3 \\ -1/3 \end{pmatrix}}.$
We could also divide by $-3$ to get $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -2/3 \\ 2/3 \\ 1/3 \end{pmatrix}}.$
We know that
\[\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{w}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|^2} \mathbf{w},\]so
\[\|\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{w}} \mathbf{v}\| = \left| \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|^2} \right| \|\mathbf{w}\| = \frac{|\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}|}{\|\mathbf{w}\|} = \boxed{\frac{3}{5}}.\]
Two angles have the same tangent if and only if they differ by a multiple of $\pi.$  This means $\tan x - x$ is a multiple of $\pi.$  Let
\[T(x) = \tan x - x.\]First, we prove that the function $T(x)$ is strictly increasing on the interval $\left[ 0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right).$  Let $0 \le x < y < \frac{\pi}{2}.$  Then
\[y - x < \tan (y - x) = \frac{\tan y - \tan x}{1 + \tan x \tan y} \le \tan y - \tan x.\]Re-arranging, we get $\tan x - x < \tan y - y,$ or $T(x) < T(y).$
Note that as $x$ approaches $\frac{\pi}{2},$ $T(x)$ approaches infinity
This means for every nonnegative integer $n,$ there exists a unique value of $x$ such that $T(x) = n \pi.$
We have the estimate $300 \pi \approx 942.48.$  Hence,
\[T(\tan^{-1} 942) = 942 - \tan^{-1} 942 < 942 < 300 \pi.\]Also,
\[T(\tan^{-1} 924) = 942 - \tan^{-1} 942 > 942 - \frac{\pi}{2} > 299 \pi.\]Since $299 \pi < T(\tan^{-1} 942) < 300 \pi,$ the equation $T(x) = n \pi$ has a solution on the interval $[0, \tan^{-1} 942]$ if and only if $0 \le n < 300,$ so there are $\boxed{300}$ solutions.
From the given information, $r \cos \theta = 10$ and $r \sin \theta = 3.$  Then for $(r^2, 2 \theta),$ the $x$-coordinate is
\begin{align*}
r^2 \cos 2 \theta &= r^2 (\cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta) \\
&= r^2 \cos^2 \theta - r^2 \sin^2 \theta \\
&= 10^2 - 3^2 \\
&= 91,
\end{align*}and the $y$-coordinate is
\begin{align*}
r^2 \sin 2 \theta &= r^2 (2 \sin \theta \cos \theta) \\
&= 2(r \cos \theta)(r \sin \theta) \\
&= 2 \cdot 10 \cdot 3 \\
&= 60.
\end{align*}Thus, the rectangular coordinates are $\boxed{(91,60)}.$
Suppose $\mathbf{P}$ is the matrix for projecting onto the vector $\mathbf{p}.$  Then for any vector $\mathbf{v},$ $\mathbf{P} \mathbf{v}$ is a scalar multiple of $\mathbf{p}.$  So when we apply the projection again to $\mathbf{P} \mathbf{v},$ the result is still $\mathbf{P} \mathbf{v}.$  This means
\[\mathbf{P} (\mathbf{P} \mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{P} \mathbf{v}.\]In other words, $\mathbf{P}^2 \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{P} \mathbf{v}.$  Since this holds for all vectors $\mathbf{v},$
\[\mathbf{P}^2 = \mathbf{P}.\]Here,
\[\mathbf{P}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & \frac{15}{34} \\ c & \frac{25}{34} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & \frac{15}{34} \\ c & \frac{25}{34} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + \frac{15}{34} c & \frac{15}{34} a + \frac{375}{1156} \\ ac + \frac{25}{34} c & \frac{15}{34} c + \frac{625}{1156} \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, $\frac{15}{34} a + \frac{375}{1156} = \frac{15}{34}$ and $\frac{15}{34} c + \frac{625}{1156} = \frac{25}{34}.$  Solving, we find $(a,c) = \boxed{\left( \frac{9}{34}, \frac{15}{34} \right)}.$
Since the sine function has period $360^\circ,$
\[\sin 604^\circ = \sin (604^\circ - 2 \cdot 360^\circ) = \sin (-116^\circ).\]Since sine is an odd function,
\[\sin (-116^\circ) = -\sin 116^\circ.\]Since $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ for all angles $x,$
\[-\sin 116^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 116^\circ) = -\sin 64^\circ.\]Then $-\sin 64^\circ = \sin (-64^\circ),$ so $n = \boxed{-64}.$
We have that
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 1 & -3 \end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \frac{1}{(2)(-3) - (0)(1)} \begin{pmatrix} -3 & 0 \\ -1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ \frac{1}{6} & -\frac{1}{3} \end{pmatrix}.\]Also,
\[a \mathbf{M} + b \mathbf{I} = a \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 1 & -3 \end{pmatrix} + b \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2a + b & 0 \\ a & -3a + b \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, $2a + b = \frac{1}{2},$ $a = \frac{1}{6},$ and $-3a + b = -\frac{1}{3}.$  Solving, we find $(a,b) = \boxed{\left( \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{6} \right)}.$
By the Law of Sines on triangle $ABC,$
\[\frac{BD}{\sin \angle BAD} = \frac{AD}{\sin 60^\circ} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \quad \sin \angle BAD = \frac{BD \sqrt{3}}{2 AD}.\]By the Law of Sines on triangle $ACD,$
\[\frac{CD}{\sin \angle CAD} = \frac{AD}{\sin 45^\circ} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \quad \sin \angle CAD = \frac{CD}{AD \sqrt{2}}.\][asy]

Let $z_0 = 5,$ and let $z_n$ be the position of the point after $n$ steps
\[z_n = \omega z_{n - 1} + 10,\]where $\omega = \operatorname{cis} \frac{\pi}{4}.$  Then
\begin{align*}
z_1 &= 5 \omega + 10, \\
z_2 &= \omega (5 \omega + 10) = 5 \omega^2 + 10 \omega + 10, \\
z_3 &= \omega (5 \omega^2 + 10 \omega + 10) + 10 = 5 \omega^3 + 10 \omega^2 + 10 \omega + 10,
\end{align*}and so on
In general, we can prove by induction that
\[z_n = 5 \omega^n + 10 (\omega^{n - 1} + \omega^{n - 2} + \dots + 1).\]In particular,
\[z_{150} = 5 \omega^{150} + 10 (\omega^{149} + \omega^{148} + \dots + 1).\]Note that $\omega^4 = \operatorname{cis} \pi = -1$ and $\omega^8 = 1.$  Then by the formula for a geometric series,
\begin{align*}
z_{150} &= 5 \omega^{150} + 10 (\omega^{149} + \omega^{148} + \dots + 1) \\
&= 5 \omega^{150} + 10 \cdot \frac{1 - \omega^{150}}{1 - \omega} \\
&= 5 (\omega^8)^{18} \cdot \omega^6 + 10 \cdot \frac{1 - (\omega^8)^{18} \cdot \omega^6}{1 - \omega} \\
&= 5 \omega^6 + 10 \cdot \frac{1 - \omega^6}{1 - \omega} \\
&= 5 \omega^6 + 10 (\omega^5 + \omega^4 + \omega^3 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1) \\
&= -5 \omega^2 + 10 (-\omega - 1 + \omega^3 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1) \\
&= 10 \omega^3 + 5 \omega^2 \\
&= 10 \operatorname{cis} \frac{3 \pi}{4} + 5i \\
&= 10 \cos \frac{3 \pi}{4} + 10i \sin \frac{3 \pi}{4} + 5i \\
&= -5 \sqrt{2} + (5 + 5 \sqrt{2}) i.
\end{align*}Thus, the final point is $\boxed{(-5 \sqrt{2}, 5 + 5 \sqrt{2})}.$
Let $z$ be the image of $-1 - i$ under the dilation.

dot("$2 + 3i$", (2,3), NE);
dot("$-1 - i$", (-1,-1), NW);
dot("$-7 - 9i$", (-7,-9), SW);
[/asy]
Since the dilation is centered at $2 + 3i,$ with scale factor 3,
\[z - (2 + 3i) = 3((-1 - i) - (2 + 3i)).\]Solving, we find $z = \boxed{-7 - 9i}.$
We can write the equation of the line as
\[\frac{x}{3} = \frac{y}{-2} = \frac{z}{6}.\]Thus, the direction vector of the line is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.$  The projection of $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ onto the line is then
\[\frac{\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{14}{49} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 6/7 \\ -4/7 \\ 12/7 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Let $\mathbf{a}$ denote $\overrightarrow{A},$ etc
Then from the given information,
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{d} &= \frac{2}{3} \mathbf{b} + \frac{1}{3} \mathbf{c}, \\
\mathbf{e} &= \frac{1}{3} \mathbf{a} + \frac{2}{3} \mathbf{c}, \\
\mathbf{f} &= \frac{2}{3} \mathbf{a} + \frac{1}{3} \mathbf{b}.
\end{align*}From the first and third equations,
\[\mathbf{b} = \frac{3 \mathbf{d} - \mathbf{c}}{2} = 3 \mathbf{f} - 2 \mathbf{a}.\]Then $3 \mathbf{d} - \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{f} - 4 \mathbf{a},$ or $3 \mathbf{d} + 4 \mathbf{a} = 6 \mathbf{f} + \mathbf{c},$ or
\[\frac{3}{7} \mathbf{d} + \frac{4}{7} \mathbf{a} = \frac{6}{7} \mathbf{f} + \frac{1}{7} \mathbf{c}.\]Since the coefficients on both sides of the equation add up to 1, the vector on the left side lies on line $AD,$ and the vector on the right side lies on line $CF.$  Therefore, this common vector is $\mathbf{p}.$  Furthermore, $\frac{AP}{PD} = \frac{3}{4}$ and $\frac{FP}{PC} = \frac{1}{6}.$
Similarly, we can show that
\[\frac{BQ}{QE} = \frac{CR}{RF} = \frac{3}{4} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{DQ}{QA} = \frac{ER}{RB} = \frac{1}{6}.\]In other words, $AP:PQ:QD = BQ:QR:RE = CR:RP:PF = 3:3:1.$
Remember that for triangles that share the same height, the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases
Hence,
\[\frac{[ACD]}{[ABC]} = \frac{CD}{BC} = \frac{2}{3}.\]Then
\[\frac{[PCD]}{[ACD]} = \frac{PD}{AD} = \frac{4}{7}.\]Finally,
\begin{align*}
\frac{[PQR]}{[PCD]} &= \frac{\frac{1}{2} PQ \cdot PR \cdot \sin \angle RPQ}{\frac{1}{2} PD \cdot PC \cdot \sin \angle CPD} \\
&= \frac{PQ}{PD} \cdot \frac{PR}{PC} \\
&= \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{8}.
\end{align*}Multiplying all these equations, we get
\[\frac{[ACD]}{[ABC]} \cdot \frac{[PCD]}{[ACD]} \cdot \frac{[PQR]}{[PCD]} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{7} \cdot \frac{3}{8},\]which gives us
\[\frac{[PQR]}{[ABC]} = \boxed{\frac{1}{7}}.\]

Then $\tan \theta = x,$ so $\theta = \arctan x.$  Then
\[\cos (\arctan x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}},\]so
\[\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = x.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[\frac{1}{x^2 + 1} = x^2,\]so $x^4 + x^2 - 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,
\[x^2 = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]Since $x^2$ is positive,
\[x^2 = \boxed{\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}.\]
By the Law of Cosines,
\[\cos A = \frac{3^2 + 6^2 - 8^2}{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 6} = -\frac{19}{36}.\][asy]

As usual, we start by graphing these lines
An easy way to go about it is to plot some points
Let's plug in $t =0$ and $t = 1$ for line $l$, getting the points $(1, 4)$ and $(5, 7)$
Here's our line:
size(200);
import TrigMacros;
import olympiad;
//Gives the maximum line that fits in the box
path maxLine(pair A, pair B, real xmin, real xmax, real ymin, real ymax)
path[] endpoints;
endpoints = intersectionpoints(A+10(B-A) -- A-10(B-A), (xmin, ymin)--(xmin, ymax)--(xmax, ymax)--(xmax, ymin)--cycle);
return endpoints[1]--endpoints[0];
pair A= (1,4);
pair B = (-5, 6);
//Direction vector of the parallel lines
pair dir = (4,3);
//Foot of the perpendicular from A to the other line
pair P = foot(A, B-dir, B+dir);
rr_cartesian_axes(-8,8,-5,12,complexplane=false,usegrid=true);
draw(maxLine(A,A+dir, -8,8,-5,12));
label("$l$", A-1.8dir, SE);
dot("$t = 0$", A, SE);
dot("$t = 1$", A + dir, SE);
[/asy]
Similarly, we plug in $s = 0$ and $s = 1$ for line $m$, getting the points $(-5, 6)$ and $(-1, 9)$:
size(200);
import TrigMacros;
import olympiad;
//Gives the maximum line that fits in the box
path maxLine(pair A, pair B, real xmin, real xmax, real ymin, real ymax)
path[] endpoints;
endpoints = intersectionpoints(A+10(B-A) -- A-10(B-A), (xmin, ymin)--(xmin, ymax)--(xmax, ymax)--(xmax, ymin)--cycle);
return endpoints[1]--endpoints[0];
pair A = (1,4);
pair B = (-5, 6);
//Direction vector of the parallel lines
pair dir = (4,3);
//Foot of the perpendicular from A to the other line
pair P = foot(A, B-dir, B+dir);
rr_cartesian_axes(-8,8,-5,12,complexplane=false,usegrid=true);
draw(maxLine(A,A+dir, -8,8,-5,12));
draw(maxLine(B,B+dir, -8,8,-5,12));
label("$l$", A+dir, SE);
label("$m$",P+dir, NW);
dot("$s = 0$", B, NW);
dot("$s = 1$", B + dir,NW);
[/asy]
Now we label some points $A$ and $B$, as well as point $P$, and we draw in our vectors:
size(200);
import TrigMacros;
import olympiad;
//Gives the maximum line that fits in the box
path maxLine(pair A, pair B, real xmin, real xmax, real ymin, real ymax)
path[] endpoints;
endpoints = intersectionpoints(A+10(B-A) -- A-10(B-A), (xmin, ymin)--(xmin, ymax)--(xmax, ymax)--(xmax, ymin)--cycle);
return endpoints[1]--endpoints[0];
pair A = (1,4);
pair B= (-5, 6);
//Direction vector of the parallel lines
pair dir = (4,3);
//Foot of the perpendicular from A to the other line
pair P = foot(A, B-dir, B+dir);
rr_cartesian_axes(-8,8,-5,12,complexplane=false,usegrid=true);
draw(maxLine(A,A+dir, -8,8,-5,12));
draw(maxLine(B,B+dir, -8,8,-5,12));
draw(P--A, red, Arrow(size = 0.3cm));
draw(B--A, blue, Arrow(size = 0.3cm));
draw(rightanglemark(A, P, P + (P-B), 15));

label("$m$", P+dir, NW);
dot("$A$", A, SE);
dot("$P$", P, NW);
dot("$B$", B, NW);

Recall that when we project $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\mathbf{u}$, we place the tail of $\mathbf{v}$ onto a line with direction $\mathbf{u}$, then we drop a perpendicular and draw the vector from the tail of $\mathbf{v}$ to the foot of the perpendicular.
This picture actually doesn't look like our usual projection picture! The vector we're projecting and the projection aren't tail to tail, which makes things harder to visualize
Let's shift the vector over and see if it helps, choosing $Q$ such that
\[\overrightarrow{BQ} = \overrightarrow{PA}.\]Here's the picture:
size(200);
import TrigMacros;
import olympiad;
//Gives the maximum line that fits in the box
path maxLine(pair A, pair B, real xmin, real xmax, real ymin, real ymax)
path[] endpoints;
endpoints = intersectionpoints(A+10(B-A) -- A-10(B-A), (xmin, ymin)--(xmin, ymax)--(xmax, ymax)--(xmax, ymin)--cycle);
return endpoints[1]--endpoints[0];
pair A = (1,4);
pair B= (-5, 6);
//Direction vector of the parallel lines
pair dir = (4,3);
//Foot of the perpendicular from A to the other line
pair P = foot(A, B-dir, B+dir);
//End of the shifted vector PA:
pair Q = B+A-P;
rr_cartesian_axes(-8,8,-5,12,complexplane=false,usegrid=true);
draw(maxLine(A,A+dir, -8,8,-5,12));
draw(maxLine(B,B+dir, -8,8,-5,12));
draw(P--A, red, Arrow(size = 0.3cm));
draw(B--A, blue, Arrow(size = 0.3cm));
draw(rightanglemark(A, P, P + (P-B), 15));
draw(B--Q, red, Arrow(size = 0.3cm));
draw(rightanglemark(B,Q, A-2*dir, 15));
label("$l$", A+dir, SE);
label("$m$", P+dir, NW);
dot("$A$", A, SE);
dot("$P$", P, NW);
dot("$Q$",Q, SE);
dot("$B$", B, NW);
[/asy]
That looks better! Our shifted vector $\overrightarrow{BQ}$ is tail to tail with the vector being projected
In fact, since this vector is perpendicular to lines $l$ and $m$, we know that it lies along a line with direction
Define a coordinate system with $D$ at the origin and $C,$ $A,$ and $H$ on the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes respectively
Then $D=(0,0,0),$ $M=\left(\frac{1}{2},1,0\right),$ and $N=\left(1,0,\frac{1}{2}\right).$ The plane going through $D,$ $M,$ and $N$ has equation
\[2x-y-4z=0.\]This plane intersects $\overline{BF}$ at $Q = \left(1,1,\frac{1}{4}\right).$  Let $P = (1,2,0).$ Since $2(1) - 1(2) - 4(0) = 0,$ $P$ is on the plane
Also, $P$ lies on the extensions of segments $\overline{DM},$ $\overline{NQ},$ and $\overline{CB}$.

We can then decompose pyramid $PCDN$ into pyramid $PBMQ$ and frustum $BMQCDN$
Pyramid $PCDN$ has base 1 and height $\frac{1}{2},$ so its volume is $[PCDN] = \frac{1}{6}.$  Note that pyramid $PBMQ$ is similar to pyramid $PCDN,$ with similarity $\frac{1}{2},$ so
\[[PBMQ] = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{48}.\]Then
\[[BMQCDN] = \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{48} = \frac{7}{48},\]so the volume of the larger solid, cut by plane $DMQN,$ is $1 - \frac{7}{48} = \boxed{\frac{41}{48}}.$
Setting $t = 0,$ we get
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{v}.\]But the distance between $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is $t = 0,$ so $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  Thus,
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \mathbf{d}.\]Then for $x \ge 3,$
\[\left\| \begin{pmatrix} x - 3 \\ y - 1 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \left\| \begin{pmatrix} x - 3 \\ \frac{3x - 9}{4} \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \left\| \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{3}{4} \end{pmatrix} \right\| (x - 3) = \frac{5}{4} (x - 3).\]We want this to be $t,$ so $t = \frac{5}{4} (x - 3).$  Then $x = \frac{4}{5} t + 3,$ and $y = \frac{3x - 5}{4} = \frac{3}{5} t + 1,$ so
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4}{5} t + 3 \\ \frac{3}{5} t + 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 4/5 \\ 3/5 \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, $\mathbf{d} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 4/5 \\ 3/5 \end{pmatrix}}.$
By sum-to-product,
\[\sin 4x + \sin 6x = \boxed{2 \sin 5x \cos x}.\]
Let $y = 15t - 7.$  Then
\[15t - 7 = \frac{3}{2} x - 25.\]Solving for $x,$ we find $x = \boxed{10t + 12}.$
To obtain the point $\left( -2, \frac{3 \pi}{8} \right),$ we move counter-clockwise from the positive $x$-axis by an angle of $\frac{3 \pi}{8},$ then take the point with $r = -2$ at this angle
Since $-2$ is negative, we end up reflecting through the origin
Thus, we arrive at the point $\boxed{\left( 2, \frac{11 \pi}{8} \right)}.$

Without loss of generality, let the triangle be $ABC,$ where $AB = 9,$ $AC = 15,$ and $\angle B = 2 \angle C.$  Let $a = BC.$  Then by the Law of Cosines,
\[\cos C = \frac{a^2 + 15^2 - 9^2}{2 \cdot a \cdot 15} = \frac{a^2 + 144}{30a}.\]By the Law of Sines,
\[\frac{9}{\sin C} = \frac{15}{\sin B} = \frac{15}{\sin 2C} = \frac{15}{2 \sin C \cos C},\]so $\cos C = \frac{5}{6}.$  Hence,
\[\frac{a^2 + 144}{30a} = \frac{5}{6}.\]This gives us $a^2 + 144 = 25a,$ or $a^2 - 25a + 144 = 0.$  This factors as $(a - 9)(a - 16) = 0.$
If $a = 9,$ then $\angle A = \angle C,$ which implies $A + B + C = 4C = 180^\circ.$  Then $B = 2C = 90^\circ,$ contradiction, because a triangle with sides 9, 9, and 15 is not a right triangle
Therefore, $a = \boxed{16}.$
First, we can write
\begin{align*}
&\cos^2 x + \cos^2 (x + y) - 2 \cos x \cos y \cos (x + y) \\
&= \cos^2 x + \cos (x + y) (\cos (x + y) - 2 \cos x \cos y).
\end{align*}From the angle addition formula, $\cos (x + y) = \cos x \cos y - \sin x \sin y,$ so
\begin{align*}
&\cos^2 x + \cos (x + y) (\cos (x + y) - 2 \cos x \cos y) \\
&= \cos^2 x + \cos (x + y) (-\cos x \cos y - \sin x \sin y).
\end{align*}From the angle subtraction formula, $\cos (x - y) = \cos x \cos y + \sin x \sin y,$ so
\begin{align*}
&\cos^2 x + \cos (x + y) (-\cos x \cos y - \sin x \sin y) \\
&= \cos^2 x - \cos (x + y) \cos (x - y).
\end{align*}From the product-to-sum formula,
\begin{align*}
\cos^2 x - \cos (x + y) \cos (x - y) &= \cos^2 x - \frac{1}{2} (\cos 2x + \cos 2y) \\
&= \cos^2 x - \frac{1}{2} \cos 2x - \frac{1}{2} \cos 2y.
\end{align*}Finally, from the double-angle formula,
\begin{align*}
\cos^2 x - \frac{1}{2} \cos 2x - \frac{1}{2} \cos 2y &= \cos^2 x - \frac{1}{2} \cdot (2 \cos^2 x - 1) - \frac{1}{2} (2 \cos^2 y - 1) \\
&= 1 - \cos^2 y = \boxed{\sin^2 y}.
\end{align*}

On each interval of the form $(2 \pi n, 2 \pi n + \pi),$ where $n$ is a nonnegative integer, the two graphs intersect twice
On each interval of the form $(2 \pi n + \pi, 2 \pi n + 2 \pi),$ the two graphs do not intersect
Thus, on the interval $(0, 100 \pi),$ the two graphs intersect $\boxed{100}$ times.
We can write
\[(3 \operatorname{cis} 18^\circ)(-2\operatorname{cis} 37^\circ) = (3)(-2) \operatorname{cis}(18^\circ + 37^\circ) = -6 \operatorname{cis} 55^\circ.\]Since we want $r > 0,$ we can write $-6 \operatorname{cis} 55^\circ = 6 \operatorname{cis} (55^\circ + 180^\circ) = 6 \operatorname{cis} 235^\circ.$  Hence, $(r,\theta) = \boxed{(6,235^\circ)}.$
We can try solving for the matrix $\mathbf{M}.$  Alternatively, we can try to express $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ as a linear combination of $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.$  Let
\[\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = a \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + b \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2a - 3b \\ -a + 5b \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, $5 = 2a - 3b$ and $1 = -a + 5b.$  Solving, we find $a = 4$ and $b = 1,$ so
\[\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = 4 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.\]Therefore,
\[\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = 4 \mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + \mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} = 4 \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 11 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Since the graph of $y = 2 \sin \left( 2x + \frac{\pi}{3} \right)$ is the same as the graph of $y = 2 \sin 2x$ shifted $\frac{\pi}{6}$ units to the left, the phase shift is $\boxed{-\frac{\pi}{6}}.$

Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}.$  From the formula for a projection,
\[\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{w}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}} \mathbf{w} = \frac{2x - y + 2z}{9} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.\]Hence, we must have $\frac{2x - y + 2z}{9} = 2,$ or $\boxed{2x - y + 2z - 18 = 0},$ which gives us the equation of the plane.
If $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{a} & \frac{1}{b} \\ \frac{1}{c} & \frac{1}{d} \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1},$ then
\[\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{a} & \frac{1}{b} \\ \frac{1}{c} & \frac{1}{d} \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1} = \mathbf{I}.\]This becomes
\[\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \frac{b}{c} & \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{d} \\ \frac{c}{a} + \frac{d}{c} & \frac{c}{b} + 1 \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1} = \mathbf{I}.\]Then $1 + \frac{b}{c} = 1,$ so $\frac{b}{c} = 0,$ which means $b = 0.$  But then $\frac{1}{b}$ is undefined, so there are $\boxed{0}$ solutions.
Let $H$ be the orthocenter of triangle $ABC.$  Since

Since $\angle AEB = 90^\circ,$ $\angle ABE = 90^\circ - A.$  But $\angle BFH = 90^\circ,$ so $\angle BHF = A.$  Since $\overline{PR}$ is parallel to $\overline{CF}$ and $\overline{QR}$ is parallel to $\overline{BE},$ $\angle PRQ = A.$
Similarly, we can show that $\angle AHF = B.$  Since $\overline{PQ}$ is parallel to $\overline{AD},$ and $\overline{PR}$ is parallel to $\overline{CF},$ $\angle QPR = B.$  Hence, triangles $ABC$ and $RPQ$ are similar
This means
\[\frac{PQ}{BC} = \frac{QR}{AC} = \frac{PR}{AB}.\]Then
\[\frac{9AD}{BC} = \frac{4BE}{AC} = \frac{7CF}{AB}.\]But $AD = \frac{2K}{BC},$ $BE = \frac{2K}{AC},$ and $CF = \frac{2K}{AB},$ where $K$ is the area of triangle $ABC,$ so
\[\frac{18K}{BC^2} = \frac{8K}{AC^2} = \frac{14K}{AB^2}.\]Hence,
\[\frac{BC^2}{9} = \frac{AC^2}{4} = \frac{AB^2}{7},\]so $BC:AC:AB = 3:2:\sqrt{7}.$
Finally, by the Law of Cosines,
\[\cos C = \frac{3^2 + 2^2 - 7}{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2},\]so $C = \boxed{60^\circ}.$
Let $x = \cos \frac{2 \pi}{13} + \cos \frac{6 \pi}{13} + \cos \frac{8 \pi}{13},$ and let $\omega = e^{2 \pi i/13}.$  Then $\omega^{13} = e^{2 \pi i} = 1.$  We see that $x$ is the real part of
\[\omega + \omega^3 + \omega^4.\]Since $|\omega| = 1,$ $\overline{\omega} = \frac{1}{\omega}.$  Thus, $x$ is also the real part of
\begin{align*}
\overline{\omega + \omega^3 + \omega^4} &= \overline{\omega} + \overline{\omega^3} + \overline{\omega^4} \\
&= \frac{1}{\omega} + \frac{1}{\omega^3} + \frac{1}{\omega^4} \\
&= \omega^{12} + \omega^{10} + \omega^9.
\end{align*}Hence,
\[x = \frac{\omega + \omega^3 + \omega^4 + \omega^9 + \omega^{10} + \omega^{12}}{2}.\]From the equation $\omega^{13} = 1,$ $\omega^{13} - 1 = 0,$ which factors as
\[(\omega - 1)(\omega^{12} + \omega^{11} + \omega^{10} + \dots + 1) = 0.\]Since $\omega \neq 1,$
\[1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \dots + \omega^{12} = 0.\]Let
\begin{align*}
\alpha &= \omega + \omega^3 + \omega^4 + \omega^9 + \omega^{10} + \omega^{12}, \\
\beta &= \omega^2 + \omega^5 + \omega^6 + \omega^7 + \omega^8 + \omega^{11}.
\end{align*}Then $\alpha + \beta = \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 + \dots + \omega^{12} = -1.$
Also, using the fact that $\omega^{13} = 1,$ the product $\alpha \beta$ simplifies to
\[\alpha \beta = 3 \omega + 3 \omega^2 + \dots + 3 \omega^{12} = -3.\]Hence, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the roots of $z^2 + z - 3 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,
\[z = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2}.\]Thus, $x = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{4}$ or $x = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{13}}{4}.$
Note that
\[\cos \frac{8 \pi}{13} = -\cos \left( \pi - \frac{8 \pi}{13} \right) = -\cos \frac{5 \pi}{13},\]so
\[x = \cos \frac{2 \pi}{13} + \cos \frac{6 \pi}{13} + \cos \frac{8 \pi}{13} = \left( \cos \frac{2 \pi}{13} - \cos \frac{5 \pi}{13} \right) + \cos \frac{6 \pi}{13} > 0.\]Therefore,
\[x = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{13} - 1}{4}}.\]
Let $a = \sin^{-1} \frac{3}{5}$ and $b = \tan^{-1} 2.$  Then $\sin a = \frac{3}{5}$ and $\tan b = 2.$  With the usual technique of constructing right triangles, we can find that $\cos a = \frac{4}{5},$ $\cos b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}},$ and $\sin b = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.$  Therefore, from the angle addition formula,
\begin{align*}
\sin (a + b) &= \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b \\
&= \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} + \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \\
&= \frac{11}{5 \sqrt{5}} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{11 \sqrt{5}}{25}}.
\end{align*}
The transformation that rotates about the origin by an angle of $120^\circ$ counter-clockwise takes $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ to $\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ \sqrt{3}/2 \end{pmatrix},$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ to $\begin{pmatrix} -\sqrt{3}/2 \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix},$ so the matrix is
\[\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & -\sqrt{3}/2 \\ \sqrt{3}/2 & -1/2 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We can compute that the side length of the hexagon is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.$  Then one side of the hexagon is parameterized by
\[\frac{1}{2} + ti,\]where $-\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{3}} \le t \le \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{3}}.$

Let $a + bi$ be a point on this side
\[x + yi = \frac{1}{a + bi} = \frac{a - bi}{a^2 + b^2} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} - ti}{\frac{1}{4} + t^2},\]so $x = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4} + t^2}$ and $y = -\frac{t}{\frac{1}{4} + t^2}.$
We eliminate $t,$ to see what this point traces as $t$ varies
Dividing these equations, we get
\[\frac{y}{x} = -2t,\]so $t = -\frac{y}{2x}.$  Substituting into the first equation, we get
\[x = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{y^2}{4x^2}}.\]This simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 = 2x.$  Completing the square in $x,$ we get
\[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1.\]This represents the circle centered at 1 with radius 1.
Hence, as $t$ varies over $-\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{3}} \le t \le \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{3}},$ $x + yi$ traces an arc of this circle
Its endpoints are $\frac{3}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i$ and $\frac{3}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i.$  We can check that this arc is $120^\circ.$

We can divide $S$ into 12 equilateral triangles with side length 1, and six $120^\circ$-sectors with radius 1, so the area of $S$ is
\[12 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + 6 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \pi = \boxed{3 \sqrt{3} + 2 \pi}.\]Here are some alternative ways to derive the arc of the circle:
Alternative 1: Let $w = \frac{1}{z},$ where the real part of $z$ is $\frac{1}{2}.$  Write $w = r \operatorname{cis} \theta.$  Then
\[\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{w} = \frac{1}{r \operatorname{cis} \theta} = \frac{1}{r} \operatorname{cis} (-\theta) = \frac{\cos \theta - i \sin \theta}{r},\]so $\frac{\cos \theta}{r} = \frac{1}{2},$ or $r = 2 \cos \theta.$
If $x + yi = w = r \operatorname{cis} \theta = r \cos \theta + i \sin \theta,$ then
\[x^2 + y^2 = r^2 = 2r \cos \theta = 2x,\]so $(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1.$
Alternative 2: Let $w = \frac{1}{z},$ where the real part of $z$ is $\frac{1}{2}.$  Then $z$ is equidistant from 0 and 1 (the line $x = \frac{1}{2}$ is the perpendicular bisector of 0 and 1), so
For $r = \sin 2 \theta,$
\begin{align*}
y &= r \sin \theta \\
&= \sin 2 \theta \sin \theta \\
&= 2 \sin^2 \theta \cos \theta \\
&= 2 (1 - \cos^2 \theta) \cos \theta.
\end{align*}Let $k = \cos \theta.$  Then $y = 2 (1 - k^2) k,$ and
\[y^2 = 4k^2 (1 - k^2)^2 = 4k^2 (1 - k^2)(1 - k^2).\]By AM-GM,
\[2k^2 (1 - k^2)(1 - k^2) \le \left( \frac{(2k^2) + (1 - k^2) + (1 - k^2)}{3} \right)^3 = \frac{8}{27},\]so
\[y^2 \le \frac{16}{27}.\]Hence,
\[|y| \le \sqrt{\frac{16}{27}} = \frac{4 \sqrt{3}}{9}.\]We get $y = \boxed{\frac{4 \sqrt{3}}{9}}$ when $k^2 = \cos^2 \theta = \frac{1}{3},$ so this is the maximum $y$-coordinate.

Let $t = \cos^2 x.$  Then $\sin^2 x = 1 - t,$ so
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin^6 x + \cos^6 x + 1}{\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x + 1} &= \frac{t^3 + (1 - t)^3 + 1}{t^2 + (1 - t)^2 + 1} \\
&= \frac{3t^2 - 3t + 2}{2t^2 - 2t + 2}.
\end{align*}Dividing the denominator into the numerator, we obtain
\[\frac{3t^2 - 3t + 2}{2t^2 - 2t + 2} = \frac{3}{2} - \frac{1}{2(t^2 - t + 1)}.\]Minimizing this expression is equivalent to maximizing $\frac{1}{2(t^2 - t + 1)},$ which in turn is equivalent to minimizing $t^2 - t + 1.$  The minimum occurs when $t = \frac{1}{2}$ (which is in the range of $\cos^2 x$), so the minimum value is
\[\frac{3}{2} - \frac{1}{2((1/2)^2 - 1/2 + 1)} = \boxed{\frac{5}{6}}.\]
In cylindrical coordinates, $\theta$ denotes the angle a point makes with the positive $x$-axis
Thus, for a fixed angle $\theta = c,$ all the points lie on a plane
The answer is $\boxed{\text{(C)}}.$  Note that we can obtain all points in this plane by taking $r$ negative.

We have that

We can compute that $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.$  From the given equation,
\[(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = p ((\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \cdot  \mathbf{a}) + q
((\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{b}) + r ((\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})).\]Since $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is orthogonal to both $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b},$ $(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \cdot  \mathbf{a} = (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \cdot  \mathbf{b} = 0,$ so this reduces to
\[-9 = 54r.\]Hence, $r = \boxed{-\frac{1}{6}}.$
For $x = \frac{t + 1}{t}$ and $y = \frac{t - 1}{t},$
\[x + y = \frac{t + 1}{t} + \frac{t - 1}{t} = \frac{2t}{t} = 2.\]Thus, all the plotted points lie on a line
The answer is $\boxed{\text{(A)}}.$
From the triple angle formula,
\[\cos 3 \theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^3 - 3 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{-\frac{11}{16}}.\]

Since $-90^\circ < x < 90^\circ$, we have that $0 < \cos x \le 1$
Thus, $0 < \sqrt{\cos x} \le 1$
Since the range of $\log_2 x$ for $0<x\le1$ is all non-positive numbers, the range of the entire function is all non-positive numbers, or $\boxed{(-\infty,0]}.$
Since $\sin x,$ $\cos x,$ $\tan x$ is a geometric sequence,
\[\cos^2 x = \sin x \tan x.\]Then
\[\cot^2 x = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin ^2 x} = \frac{\sin x \tan x}{\sin^2 x} = \frac{1}{\cos x},\]so
\[\cot^4 x = \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x}{\cos^2 x} = \tan^2 x + 1.\]Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\cot^6 x - \cot^2 x &= \cot^2 x (\cot^4 x - 1) \\
&= \cot^2 x \tan^2 x = \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}
We have that
\[\csc 225^\circ = \frac{1}{\sin 225^\circ}.\]Then $\sin 225^\circ = -\sin (225^\circ - 180^\circ) = -\sin 45^\circ = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ so
\[\frac{1}{\sin 225^\circ} = \boxed{-\sqrt{2}}.\]
To find the spherical coordinates of a point $P,$ we measure the angle that $\overline{OP}$ makes with the positive $x$-axis, which is $\theta,$ and the angle that $\overline{OP}$ makes with the positive $z$-axis, which is $\phi,$ where $O$ is the origin.

The normal ranges for $\theta$ and $\phi$ are $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi$ and $0 \le \phi \le \pi.$  Since $\phi = \frac{8 \pi}{5}$ is greater than $\pi,$ we end up wrapping past the negative $z$-axis
Thus, $\phi$ becomes $2 \pi - \frac{8 \pi}{5} = \frac{2 \pi}{5},$ and $\theta$ becomes $\frac{2 \pi}{7} + \pi = \frac{9 \pi}{7}.$  Thus, the standard spherical coordinates are $\boxed{\left( 3, \frac{9 \pi}{7}, \frac{2 \pi}{5} \right)}.$
Multiplying the given equations, we obtain
\[e^{i (\alpha + \beta)} = \left( \frac{3}{5}  +\frac{4}{5} i \right) \left( -\frac{12}{13} + \frac{5}{13} i \right) = -\frac{56}{65} - \frac{33}{65} i.\]But $e^{i (\alpha + \beta)} = \cos (\alpha + \beta) + i \sin (\alpha + \beta),$ so $\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \boxed{-\frac{33}{65}}.$
Let $\mathbf{v}$ be an arbitrary vector, and let $\mathbf{r}$ be the reflection of $\mathbf{v}$ over $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},$ so $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{R} \mathbf{v}.$

Then the reflection of $\mathbf{r}$ is $\mathbf{v},$ so $\mathbf{R} \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{v}.$  Thus,
\[\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{R} \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{R}^2 \mathbf{v}.\]Since this holds for all vectors $\mathbf{v},$ $\mathbf{R}^2 = \mathbf{I} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}}.$
Note that angle $x$ must be acute.
If we drop an altitude from the vertex of the isosceles triangle, then we obtain two right triangles, where one of the angles is $x,$ the opposite side is $\frac{\cos 7x}{2},$ and the hypotenuse is $\cos x.$  Hence,
\[\sin x = \frac{\frac{\cos 7x}{2}}{\cos x} = \frac{\cos 7x}{2 \cos x}.\]Then $\cos 7x = 2 \sin x \cos x = \sin 2x.$  We can write this as $\cos 7x = \cos (90^\circ - 2x).$  Then the angles $7x$ and $90^\circ - 2x$ must either add up to a multiple of $180^\circ,$ or differ by a multiple of $90^\circ.$
In the first case,
\[7x + 90^\circ - 2x = 180^\circ k\]for some integer $k.$  Then
\[x = 36^\circ k - 18^\circ.\]The only acute angles of this form are $18^\circ$ and $54^\circ.$  Furthermore, if $x = 18^\circ,$ then $\cos 7x = \cos 126^\circ < 0.$  We check that $x = 54^\circ$ works.
In the second case,
\[7x - (90^\circ - 2x) = 180^\circ k\]for some integer $k.$  Then
\[x = 20^\circ k + 10^\circ.\]The only acute angles of this form are $10^\circ,$ $30^\circ,$ $50^\circ,$ and $70^\circ.$  Again, $\cos 7x < 0$ for $x = 30^\circ$ and $70^\circ.$  We check that $10^\circ$ and $50^\circ$ work.
Thus, the possible values of $x$ are $\boxed{10^\circ, 50^\circ, 54^\circ}.$
From the angle addition formula,
\begin{align*}
\tan x + \tan y &= \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} + \frac{\sin y}{\cos y} \\
&= \frac{\sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y}{\cos x \cos y} \\
&= \frac{\sin (x + y)}{\cos x \cos y} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin (x + y)}{\cos (x + y) + \cos (x - y)}.
\end{align*}Squaring the given equations and adding them, we get
\[\sin^2 x + 2 \sin x \sin y + \sin^2 y + \cos^2 x + 2 \cos x \cos y + \cos^2 y = \frac{576}{169},\]so
\[\sin x \sin y + \cos x \cos y = \frac{\frac{576}{169} - 2}{2} = \frac{119}{169}.\]Hence,
\[\cos (x - y) = \cos x \cos y + \sin x \sin y = \frac{119}{169}.\]By sum-to-product, we can write the equations given in the problem as
\begin{align*}
2 \sin \left( \frac{x + y}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{x - y}{2} \right) &= \frac{96}{65}, \\
2 \cos \left( \frac{x + y}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{x - y}{2} \right) &= \frac{72}{65}.
\end{align*}If we divide these equations, we get
\[\tan \left( \frac{x + y}{2} \right) = \frac{4}{3}.\]Since $\frac{4}{3}$ is greater than 1, this tells us
\[\frac{\pi}{4} + \pi k < \frac{x + y}{2} < \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi k\]for some integer $k.$  Then
\[\frac{\pi}{2} + 2 \pi k < x + y < \pi + 2 \pi k.\]Hence, $\sin (x + y)$ is positive.
By the double-angle formula,
\[\tan (x + y) = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{4}{3}}{1 - (\frac{4}{3})^2} = -\frac{24}{7}.\]Then $\tan^2 (x + y) = \frac{576}{49},$ so $\frac{\sin^2 (x + y)}{\cos^2 (x + y)} = \frac{576}{49},$ or
\[\frac{\sin^2 (x + y)}{1 - \sin^2 (x + y)} = \frac{576}{49}.\]Solving, we find
\[\sin^2 (x + y) = \frac{576}{625}.\]Since $\sin (x + y)$ is positive, $\sin (x + y) = \frac{24}{25}.$  Then
\[\cos (x + y) = \frac{\sin (x + y)}{\tan (x + y)} = \frac{\frac{24}{25}}{-\frac{24}{7}} = -\frac{7}{25},\]so
\[\frac{2 \sin (x + y)}{\cos (x + y) + \cos (x - y)} = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{24}{25}}{-\frac{7}{25} + \frac{119}{169}} = \boxed{\frac{507}{112}}.\]
Note that $F(n)$ is the number of points at which the graphs of $y=\sin x$ and $y=\sin nx$ intersect on $[0,\pi]$
For each $n$, $\sin nx \geq 0$ on each interval $\left[ \frac{(2k-2) \pi}{n}, \frac{(2k-1) \pi}{n} \right]$ where $k $ is a positive integer and $2k-1 \leq n$
The number of such intervals is $\frac{n}{2}$ if $n$ is even and $\frac{n + 1}{2}$ if $n$ is odd.
The graphs intersect twice on each interval unless $\sin x = 1 = \sin nx$ at some point in the interval, in which case the graphs intersect once
This last equation is satisfied if and only if $n \equiv 1\pmod 4$ and the interval contains $\frac{\pi}{2}$
If $n$ is even, this count does not include the point of intersection at $(\pi,0)$.
Therefore $F(n)= 2 \cdot \frac{n}{2} + 1=n+1$ if $n$ is even, $F(n)=\frac{2(n+1)}{2}=n+1$ if $n \equiv 3\pmod 4$, and $F(n)=n$ if $n \equiv 1\pmod 4$
Hence,
\[\sum_{n=2}^{2007} F(n)=\left(\sum_{n=2}^{2007} (n+1)\right) - \left\lfloor \frac{2007-1}{4}\right\rfloor = \frac{(2006)(3+2008)}{2}-501 = \boxed{2{,}016{,}532}.\]
The product of the matrices is
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -8 \\ a & 11 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 11 & b \\ 4 & 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3b - 24 \\ 11a + 44 & ab + 33 \end{pmatrix}.\]We want this to be the identity matrix, so $3b - 24 = 0,$ $11a + 44 = 0,$ and $ab + 33 = 1.$  Solving, we find $(a,b) = \boxed{(-4,8)}.$
From $\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|,$ $\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\|^2.$  Then
\[(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) = (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}).\]We can expand this as
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} - 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}.\]Then $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0,$ so the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is $\boxed{90^\circ}.$
Let $D,$ $E,$ $F$ be the midpoints of $\overline{BC},$ $\overline{AC},$ $\overline{AB},$ respectively
Then geometrically, $AEDF$ is a parallelogram
This means the midpoints of $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{EF}$ coincide.

The midpoint of $\overline{EF}$ is
\[\left( \frac{0 + 2}{2}, \frac{4 + 3}{2}, \frac{4 - 2}{2} \right) = \left( 1, \frac{7}{2}, 1\right).\]This is also the midpoint of $\overline{AD},$ so we can find the coordinates of $A$ by doubling the coordinates of this midpoint, and subtracting the coordinates of $D$:
\[\left( 2 \cdot 1 - 1, 2 \cdot \frac{7}{2} - 5, 2 \cdot 1 - (-1) \right) = \boxed{(1, 2, 3)}.\]
We have that $\mathbf{D} = \begin{pmatrix} k & 0 \\ 0 & k \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{R} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\ \sin \theta & \cos \theta \end{pmatrix},$ so
\[\mathbf{R} \mathbf{D} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\ \sin \theta & \cos \theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} k & 0 \\ 0 & k \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} k \cos \theta & -k \sin \theta \\ k \sin \theta & k \cos \theta \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, $k \cos \theta = 8$ and $k \sin \theta = 4.$  Dividing these equations, we find $\tan \theta = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$
We can write the system as
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k & 3 \\ 3 & k & -2 \\ 2 & 4 & -3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.\]This system has a nontrivial system exactly when the determinant of the matrix is 0
This determinant is
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} 1 & k & 3 \\ 3 & k & -2 \\ 2 & 4 & -3 \end{vmatrix} &= \begin{vmatrix} k & -2 \\ 4 & -3 \end{vmatrix} - k \begin{vmatrix} 3 & -2 \\ 2 & -3 \end{vmatrix} + 3 \begin{vmatrix} 3 & k \\ 2 & 4 \end{vmatrix} \\
&= ((k)(-3) - (-2)(4)) - k((3)(-3) - (-2)(2)) + 3((3)(4) - (k)(2)) \\
&= 44 - 4k.
\end{align*}Hence, $k = 11.$
The system becomes
\begin{align*}
x + 11y + 3z &= 0, \\
3x + 11y - 2z &= 0, \\
2x + 4y - 3z &= 0
\end{align*}Subtracting the first two equations, we get $2x - 5z = 0,$ so $z = \frac{2}{5} x.$  Substituting into the third equation, we get
\[2x + 4y - \frac{6}{5} x = 0.\]This simplifies to $y = -\frac{1}{5} x.$  Therefore,
\[\frac{xz}{y^2} = \frac{x \cdot \frac{2}{5} x}{\left( -\frac{1}{5} x \right)^2} = \boxed{10}.\]
We want $a$ to satisfy
\[\cos a + \cos 3a = 2 \cos 2a.\]By the double-angle and triple-angle formula, this becomes
\[\cos a + (4 \cos^3 a - 3 \cos a) = 2 \cdot (2 \cos^2 a - 1).\]This simplifies to
\[4 \cos^3 a - 4 \cos^2 a - 2 \cos a + 2 = 0,\]which factors as $2 (\cos a - 1)(2 \cos^2 a - 1) = 0.$  Hence, $\cos a = 1,$ $\cos a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ or $\cos a = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.$
The equation $\cos a = 1$ has no solutions for $0^\circ < a < 360^\circ.$
The equation $\cos a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ has solutions $45^\circ$ and $315^\circ.$
The equation $\cos a = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ has solutions $135^\circ$ and $225^\circ.$
Thus, the solutions are $\boxed{45^\circ, 135^\circ, 225^\circ, 315^\circ}.$
Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}.$
From the formula of a projection,
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{proj}_{\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}} \mathbf{v} &= \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \right\|^2} \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}{29} \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{5x + 2y}{29} \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{5}{2} \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}Then
\[\frac{5x + 2y}{29} = -\frac{1}{2},\]so $5x + 2y = -\frac{29}{2}.$  Solving for $y,$ we find
\[\boxed{y = -\frac{5}{2} x - \frac{29}{4}}.\]
Note that $(\mathbf{A}^{-1})^2 \mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I},$ so the inverse of $\mathbf{A}^2$ is
\[(\mathbf{A}^{-1})^2 = \begin{pmatrix} -4 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}^2 = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix}16 & -2 \\ 0 & 4 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Let $a = AP,$ $b = BP,$ $c = CP,$ and $d = DP.$  Let $\alpha = \angle APC,$ $\beta = \angle BPD,$ $\gamma = \angle BPC,$ and $\delta = \angle APD.$  Then $\cos \alpha = \frac{4}{5}$ and $\cos \beta = \frac{3}{5}.$  Since
\[\cos^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \beta = 1,\]and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are acute, these angles must satisfy $\alpha + \beta = 90^\circ.$  Also, $\sin \angle APC = \frac{3}{5}$ and $\sin \angle BPD = \frac{4}{5}.$

Note that triangles $ABP,$ $BCP,$ and $CDP$ have the same base and height, so their areas are equal
Let $K = [ABP] = [BCP] = [CDP].$
We have that
\[[APC] = \frac{1}{2} ac \sin \angle APC = \frac{3}{10} ac,\]so $K = \frac{1}{2} [APC] = \frac{3}{20} ac.$
\[[BPD] = \frac{1}{2} bd \sin \angle BPD = \frac{2}{5} bd,\]so $K = \frac{1}{2} [BPD] = \frac{1}{5} bd.$  Hence,
\[K^2 = \frac{3}{100} abcd.\]Also,
\[[APD] = \frac{1}{2} ad \sin \delta,\]so $K = \frac{1}{3} [APD] = \frac{1}{6} ad \sin \delta.$  Since $K = [BPC] = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin \gamma,$
\[K^2 = \frac{1}{12} abcd \sin \gamma \sin \delta.\]It follows that
\[\sin \gamma \sin \delta = \frac{9}{25}.\]Note that $\gamma + \delta = \alpha + \beta = 90^\circ,$ so $\delta = 90^\circ - \gamma.$  Then $\sin \delta = \sin (90^\circ - \gamma) = \cos \gamma,$ and
\[\sin \gamma \cos \gamma = \frac{9}{25}.\]Therefore, $\sin 2 \gamma = 2 \sin \gamma \cos \gamma = \boxed{\frac{18}{25}}.$
By Heron's formula, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $30 \sqrt{2}.$  Then
\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 \cdot 11 \sin A = 30 \sqrt{2},\]so $\sin A = \frac{20 \sqrt{2}}{33}.$  Therefore,
\[[ADE] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 \cdot 7 \cdot \frac{20 \sqrt{2}}{33} = \boxed{\frac{280 \sqrt{2}}{33}}.\]
Since the two lines are perpendicular, their direction vectors are orthogonal
This means that the dot product of the direction vectors is 0:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} a \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = 0.\]Then $3a - 14 = 0,$ so $a = \boxed{\frac{14}{3}}.$
The matrix
\[\begin{pmatrix} \cos 170^\circ & -\sin 170^\circ \\ \sin 170^\circ & \cos 170^\circ \end{pmatrix}\]corresponds to rotating the origin by an angle of $170^\circ$ counter-clockwise.

draw((0,0)--dir(40 + 170),Arrow(6));
label("$170^\circ$", (-0.6,0.8));
[/asy]
Thus, we seek the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $170^\circ \cdot n$ is a multiple of $360^\circ.$  In other words, we want
\[170n = 360m\]for some positive integer $m.$  This reduces to
\[17n = 36m,\]so the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{36}.$
The direction vector the line is $\begin{pmatrix} 5 - 3 \\ 1 - 4 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix},$ so the line is paramaterized by
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 + 2t \\ 4 - 3t \\ 1 + 5t \end{pmatrix}.\]We want the $z$-coordinate to be 0, so $1 + 5t = 0.$  Then $t = -\frac{1}{5},$ so the point of intersection is $\boxed{\left( \frac{13}{5}, \frac{23}{5}, 0 \right)}.$
By the vector triple product identity,
\[\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) \mathbf{c},\]so
\[(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}) \mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) \mathbf{c} = \frac{\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}}{\sqrt{2}}.\]Hence,
\[\left( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \mathbf{b} = \left( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \mathbf{c}.\]If neither side represents the zero vector, then this means one of $\mathbf{b},$ $\mathbf{c}$ is a scalar multiple of the other, which means that the set $\{\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}\}$ is linearly dependent
Therefore, both sides must be equal to the zero vector
Furthermore, we must have
\[\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.\]If $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b},$ then
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\|} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.\]Hence, $\theta = \boxed{135^\circ}.$
Note that
\[\mathbf{A}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 3 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 3 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix} = 3 \mathbf{I}.\]Then $\mathbf{A}^4 = 9 \mathbf{I},$ $\mathbf{A}^6 = 27 \mathbf{I},$ and $\mathbf{A}^8 = 81 \mathbf{I},$ so
\[\mathbf{A}^8 + \mathbf{A}^6 + \mathbf{A}^4 + \mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{I} = 81 \mathbf{I} + 27 \mathbf{I} + 9 \mathbf{I} + 3 \mathbf{I} + \mathbf{I} = 121 \mathbf{I}.\]Thus, the given equation becomes
\[121 \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 11 \end{pmatrix},\]so
\[\mathbf{v} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1/11 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
Converting to degrees,
\[-\frac{3 \pi}{4} = \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \cdot \left( -\frac{3 \pi}{4} \right) = -135^\circ.\]Since the tangent function has period $180^\circ,$ $\tan (-135^\circ) = \tan (-135^\circ + 180^\circ) = \tan 45^\circ = \boxed{1}.$
We have that $\det (\mathbf{M}^4) = (\det \mathbf{M})^4 = \boxed{16}.$
We write
\[9 - 8 \sin 50^\circ = \frac{9 \sin^2 50^\circ - 8 \sin^3 50^\circ}{\sin^2 50^\circ} = \frac{9 \sin^2 50^\circ - 6 \sin 50^\circ + 6 \sin 50^\circ - 8 \sin^3 50^\circ}{\sin^2 50^\circ}.\]By the triple angle identity,
\begin{align*}
6 \sin 50^\circ - 8 \sin^3 50^\circ &= 2 \sin (3 \cdot 50^\circ) \\
&= 2 \sin 150^\circ \\
\end{align*}so
\[9 - 8 \sin 50^\circ = \frac{9 \sin^2 50^\circ - 6 \sin 50^\circ + 1}{\sin^2 50^\circ} = \left( \frac{3 \sin 50^\circ - 1}{\sin 50^\circ} \right)^2.\]Since $3 \sin 50^\circ > 3 \sin 30^\circ = \frac{3}{2} > 1,$ $3 \sin 50^\circ - 1 > 0.$  Therefore,
\[\sqrt{9 - 8 \sin 50^\circ} = \frac{3 \sin 50^\circ - 1}{\sin 50^\circ} = 3 - \csc 50^\circ,\]so $(a,b) = \boxed{(3,-1)}.$
We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} 1 & x & y \\ 1 & x + y & y \\ 1 & x & x + y \end{vmatrix} &= \begin{vmatrix} x + y & y \\ x & x + y \end{vmatrix} - x \begin{vmatrix} 1 & y \\ 1 & x + y \end{vmatrix} + y \begin{vmatrix} 1 & x + y \\ 1 & x \end{vmatrix} \\
&= ((x +  y)^2 - xy) - x((x + y) - y) + y(x - (x + y)) \\
&= \boxed{xy}.
\end{align*}
Let $a = \cos 36^\circ$ and $b = \cos 72^\circ.$  Then by the double angle formula,
\[b = 2a^2 - 1.\]Also, $\cos (2 \cdot 72^\circ) = \cos 144^\circ = -\cos 36^\circ,$ so
\[-a = 2b^2 - 1.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[a + b = 2a^2 - 2b^2 = 2(a - b)(a + b).\]Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $a + b$ is nonzero
Hence, we can divide both sides by $2(a + b),$ to get
\[a - b = \frac{1}{2}.\]Then $a = b + \frac{1}{2}.$  Substituting into $-a = 2b^2 - 1,$ we get
\[-b - \frac{1}{2} = 2b^2 - 1.\]Then $-2b - 1 = 4b^2 - 2,$ or $4b^2 + 2b - 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,
\[b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{4}.\]Since $b = \cos 72^\circ$ is positive, $b = \boxed{\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}}.$
For $\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 5 & d \end{pmatrix},$
\[\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \frac{1}{2d - 15} \begin{pmatrix} d & -3 \\ -5 & 2 \end{pmatrix}\]Comparing entries to $k \mathbf{A},$ we get
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{2d - 15} &= 2k, \\
\frac{-3}{2d - 15} &= 3k, \\
\frac{-5}{2d - 15} &= 5k, \\
\frac{2}{2d - 15} &= dk.
\end{align*}If $k = 0,$ then $\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{0},$ which is not possible, so $k \neq 0.$  Thus, we can divide the equations $\frac{d}{2d - 15} = 2k$ and $\frac{-3}{2d - 15} = 3k$ to get
\[\frac{d}{-3} = \frac{2}{3}.\]Then $d = -2.$  Substituting into the first equation, we get
\[2k = \frac{-2}{2(-2) - 15} = \frac{2}{19},\]so $k = \frac{1}{19}.$  Thus, $(d,k) = \boxed{\left( -2, \frac{1}{19} \right)}.$
Since the projection of $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ onto $\mathbf{w}$ is $\begin{pmatrix} -9/10 \\ 3/10 \end{pmatrix},$ $\mathbf{w}$ must be a scalar multiple of $\begin{pmatrix} -9/10 \\ 3/10 \end{pmatrix}.$  Furthermore, the projection of a vector onto $\mathbf{w}$ is the same as the projection of the same vector onto any nonzero scalar multiple of $\mathbf{w}$ (because this projection depends only on the direction of $\mathbf{w}$).
Thus, the projection of $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ onto $\mathbf{w}$ is the same as the projection of $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ onto $-\frac{10}{3} \begin{pmatrix} -9/10 \\ 3/10 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix},$ which is
\[\frac{\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{11}{10} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 33/10 \\ -11/10 \end{pmatrix}}.\]
We can express the vector as
\[\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} + s \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.\]Thus, the plane is generated by $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},$ so we can find the normal vector of the plane by taking their cross product:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.\]Scaling, we can take $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector
Thus, the equation of the plane is of the form
\[2x + z + D = 0.\]Substituting the coordinates of $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix},$ we find that the equation of the plane is
\[\boxed{2x + z - 5 = 0}.\]
First, we factor the given polynomial
The polynomial has almost all the powers of $z$ from 1 to $z^6,$ which we can fill in by adding and subtracting $z^2$ and $z^3.$  This allows us to factor as follows:
\begin{align*}
z^{10} + z^9 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z + 1 &= (z^{10} - z^3) + (z^9 - z^2) + (z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) \\
&= z^3 (z^7 - 1) + z^2 (z^7 - 1) + (z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) \\
&= z^3 (z - 1)(z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) \\
&\quad + z^2 (z - 1)(z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) \\
&\quad + (z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) \\
&= (z^4 - z^2 + 1)(z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1).
\end{align*}Viewing $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ as a quadratic in $z^2,$ we can solve to get
\[z^2 = \frac{1 \pm i \sqrt{3}}{2},\]or $\operatorname{cis} \frac{\pi}{3}$ and $\operatorname{cis} \frac{5 \pi}{3}.$  Therefore, the roots of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ are
\[\operatorname{cis} \frac{\pi}{6}, \ \operatorname{cis} \frac{7 \pi}{6}, \ \operatorname{cis} \frac{5 \pi}{6}, \ \operatorname{cis} \frac{11 \pi}{6}.\]We write these as
\[\operatorname{cis} \frac{2 \pi}{12}, \ \operatorname{cis} \frac{14 \pi}{12}, \ \operatorname{cis} \frac{10 \pi}{12}, \ \operatorname{cis} \frac{22 \pi}{12}.\]If $z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0,$ then
\[(z - 1)(z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0,\]which simplifies to $z^7 = 1.$  Thus, the roots of $z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$ are of the form
\[\operatorname{cis} \frac{2 \pi j}{7},\]where $1 \le j \le 6.$
The roots of $z^k - 1 = 0$ are of the form
\[\operatorname{cis} \frac{2 \pi j}{k}.\]Thus, we need $k$ to be a multiple of both 12 and 7
The smallest such $k$ is $\boxed{84}.$
Expressing everything in terms of $\sin x$ and $\cos x,$ we get
\[\sin x + \cos x + \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} + \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} + \frac{1}{\sin x} + \frac{1}{\cos x} = 7.\]Then
\[\sin x + \cos x + \frac{\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x}{\sin x \cos x} + \frac{\sin x + \cos x}{\sin x \cos x} = 7,\]which becomes
\[\sin x + \cos x + \frac{\sin x + \cos x}{\sin x \cos x} = 7 - \frac{1}{\sin x \cos x}.\]We can factor the left-hand side, and replace $\sin x \cos x$ with $\frac{1}{2} \sin 2x$:
\[(\sin x + \cos x) \left( 1 + \frac{2}{\sin 2x} \right) = 7 - \frac{2}{\sin 2x}.\]Hence,
\[(\sin x + \cos x)(\sin 2x + 2) = 7 \sin 2x - 2.\]Squaring both sides, we get
\[(\sin^2 x + 2 \sin x \cos + \cos^2 x)(\sin^2 2x + 4 \sin 2x + 4) = 49 \sin^2 x - 28 \sin x + 4.\]We can write this as
\[(\sin 2x + 1)(\sin^2 2x + 4 \sin 2x + 4) = 49 \sin^2 x - 28 \sin x + 4.\]This simplifies to
\[\sin^3 2x - 44 \sin^2 2x + 36 \sin 2x = 0,\]so $\sin 2x (\sin^2 2x - 44 \sin 2x + 36) = 0.$
If $\sin 2x = 2 \sin x \cos x = 0,$ then the expression in the problem becomes undefined
Otherwise,
\[\sin^2 2x - 44 \sin 2x + 36 = 0.\]By the quadratic formula,
\[\sin 2x = 22 \pm 8 \sqrt{7}.\]Since $22 + 8 \sqrt{7} > 1,$ we must have $\sin 2x = \boxed{22 - 8 \sqrt{7}}.$
Since the graph of $y = \sin (3x - \pi)$ is the same as the graph of $y = \sin 3x$ shifted $\frac{\pi}{3}$ units to the right, the phase shift is $\boxed{\frac{\pi}{3}}.$
[asy]import TrigMacros;
size(400);
real g(real x)
return sin(3*x - pi);
real f(real x)
return sin(3*x);
draw(graph(g,-2*pi,2*pi,n=700,join=operator ..),red);
draw(graph(f,-2*pi,2*pi,n=700,join=operator ..));
trig_axes(-2*pi,2*pi,-2,2,pi/2,1);
layer();
rm_trig_labels(-4,4, 2);
[/asy]
Note that we can also shift the graph of $y = \sin 3x$ $\frac{\pi}{3}$ units to the left, so an answer of $\boxed{-\frac{\pi}{3}}$ is also acceptable.
By the product-to-sum formula,
\[\sin \frac{1}{2} \sin k = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \cos \left( k - \frac{1}{2} \right) - \cos \left( k + \frac{1}{2} \right) \right].\]Thus, we can make the sum in the problem telescope:
\begin{align*}
a_n &= \sum_{k = 1}^n \sin k \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{\sin \frac{1}{2} \sin k}{\sin \frac{1}{2}} \\
&= \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{\cos (k - \frac{1}{2}) - \cos (k + \frac{1}{2})}{2 \sin \frac{1}{2}} \\
&= \frac{(\cos \frac{1}{2} - \cos \frac{3}{2}) + (\cos \frac{3}{2} - \cos \frac{5}{2}) + \dots + (\cos \frac{2n - 1}{2} - \cos \frac{2n + 1}{2})}{2 \sin \frac{1}{2}} \\
&= \frac{\cos \frac{1}{2} - \cos \frac{2n + 1}{2}}{2 \sin \frac{1}{2}}.
\end{align*}Then $a_n < 0$ when $\cos \frac{1}{2} < \cos \frac{2n + 1}{2}.$  This occurs if and only if
\[2 \pi k - \frac{1}{2} < \frac{2n + 1}{2} < 2 \pi k + \frac{1}{2}\]for some integer $k.$  Equivalently,
\[2 \pi k - 1 < n < 2 \pi k.\]In other words, $n = \lfloor 2 \pi k \rfloor.$  The 100th index of this form is then $\lfloor 2 \pi \cdot 100 \rfloor = \boxed{628}.$
Since $-1 \le \sin x \le 1,$ all solutions must lie in the interval $[-100,100].$

Note that $\frac{100}{\pi} \approx 31.83.$  This means that when the graph of $y = \sin x$ reaches 1 at $x = \left( 30 + \frac{1}{2} \right) \pi,$ this point lies above the line $y = \frac{x}{100},$ and that this is the last crest of the sine function that intersects the line $y = \frac{x}{100}.$
We see that on the interval $[2 \pi k, 2 \pi (k + 1)],$ where $0 \le k \le 15,$ the graphs of $y = \frac{x}{100}$ and $y = \sin x$ intersect twice
Thus, there are $2 \cdot 16 = 32$ solutions for $0 \le x \le 100.$  By symmetry, there are also 32 solutions for $-100 \le x \le 0,$ but this double-counts the solution $x = 0.$  Thus, there are a total of $32 + 32 - 1 = \boxed{63}$ solutions.
We can expand the determinant as follows:
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} \sin^2 A & \cot A & 1 \\ \sin^2 B & \cot B & 1 \\ \sin^2 C & \cot C & 1 \end{vmatrix} &= \sin^2 A \begin{vmatrix} \cot B & 1 \\ \cot C & 1 \end{vmatrix} - \cot A \begin{vmatrix} \sin^2 B & 1 \\ \sin^2 C & 1 \end{vmatrix} + \begin{vmatrix} \sin^2 B & \cot B \\ \sin^2 C & \cot C \end{vmatrix} \\
&= \sin^2 A (\cot B - \cot C) - \cot A (\sin^2 B - \sin^2 C) + (\sin^2 B \cot C - \cot B \sin^2 C) \\
&= \sin^2 A (\cot B - \cot C) + \sin^2 B (\cot C - \cot A) + \sin^2 C (\cot A - \cot B).
\end{align*}In general,
\begin{align*}
\cot x - \cot y &= \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} - \frac{\cos y}{\sin y} \\
&= \frac{\cos x \sin y - \sin x \cos y}{\sin x \sin y} \\
&= \frac{\sin (y - x)}{\sin x \sin y}.
\end{align*}Then the determinant is equal to
\begin{align*}
&\sin^2 A (\cot B - \cot C) + \sin^2 B (\cot C - \cot A) + \sin^2 C (\cot A - \cot B) \\
&= \sin^2 A \cdot \frac{\sin (C - B)}{\sin B \sin C} + \sin^2 B \cdot \frac{\sin (A - C)}{\sin A \sin C} + \sin^2 C \cdot \frac{\sin (B - A)}{\sin A \sin B} \\
&= \frac{\sin^3 A \sin (C - B) + \sin^3 B \sin (A - C) + \sin^3 C \sin (B - A)}{\sin A \sin B \sin C}.
\end{align*}Now,
\begin{align*}
\sin^3 A &= \sin A \sin^2 A \\
&= \sin (180^\circ - B - C) \sin^2 A \\
&= \sin (B + C) \sin^2 A,
\end{align*}so $\sin^3 A \sin (C - B) = \sin^2 A \sin (C - B) \sin (B + C).$  Then
\begin{align*}
\sin (C - B) \sin (B + C) &= (\sin C \cos B - \cos C \sin B)(\sin B \cos C + \cos B \sin C) \\
&= \cos B \sin B \cos C \sin C + \cos^2 B \sin^2 C - \sin^2 B \cos^2 C - \cos B \sin B \cos C \sin C \\
&= \cos^2 B \sin^2 C - \sin^2 B \cos^2 C \\
&= (1 - \sin^2 B) \sin^2 C - \sin^2 B (1 - \sin^2 C) \\
&= \sin^2 C - \sin^2 B \sin^2 C - \sin^2 B + \sin^2 B \sin^2 C \\
&= \sin^2 C - \sin^2 B,
\end{align*}so
\[\sin^3  A \sin (C - B) = \sin^2 A (\sin^2 C - \sin^2 B).\]Similarly,
\begin{align*}
\sin^3 B \sin (A - C) &= \sin^2 B (\sin^2 A - \sin^2 C), \\
\sin^3 C \sin (B - A) &= \sin^2 C (\sin^2 B - \sin^2 A).
\end{align*}Therefore,
\begin{align*}
&\sin^3 A \sin (C - B) + \sin^3 B \sin (A - C) + \sin^3 C \sin (B - A) \\
&= \sin^2 A (\sin^2 C - \sin^2 B) + \sin^2 B (\sin^2 A - \sin^2 C) + \sin^2 C (\sin^2 B - \sin^2 A) \\
\end{align*}which means the determinant is equal to $\boxed{0}.$
Let $\mathbf{a}$ denote $\overrightarrow{A},$ etc
\begin{align*}
PA^2 &= \|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{a}\|^2 = \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{p} - 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a}, \\
PB^2 &= \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{p} - 2 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}, \\
PC^2 &= \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{p} - 2 \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{c}.
\end{align*}Also, $\mathbf{g} = \frac{\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}}{3},$ so
\begin{align*}
GA^2 &= \|\mathbf{g} - \mathbf{a}\|^2 \\
&= \left\| \frac{\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}}{3} - \mathbf{a} \right\|^2 \\
&= \frac{1}{9} \|\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a}\|^2 \\
&= \frac{1}{9} (4 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{c} - 4 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} - 4 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}).
\end{align*}Similarly,
\begin{align*}
GB^2 &= \frac{1}{9} (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 4 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{c} - 4 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} - 4 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}), \\
GC^2 &= \frac{1}{9} (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 4 \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} - 4 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} - 4 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}),
\end{align*}so
\begin{align*}
&PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 - GA^2 - GB^2 - GC^2 \\
&= \frac{1}{9} (3 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 3 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 3 \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{c} + 27 \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{p} \\
&\quad + 6 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 6 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 6 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} - 18 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{p} - 18 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{p} - 18 \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{p}).
\end{align*}Also,
\begin{align*}
PG^2 &= \left\| \mathbf{p} - \frac{\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}}{3} \right\|^2 \\
&= \frac{1}{9} \|3 \mathbf{p} - (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c})\|^2 \\
&= \frac{1}{9} (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{c} + 9 \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{p} \\
&\quad + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 2 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} - 6 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{p} - 6 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{p} - 6 \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{p}).
\end{align*}Therefore, $k = \boxed{3}.$
Since angle $A$ lies in the second quadrant, $\cos A$ is negative
\[\cos^2 A = 1 - \sin^2 A = 1 - \frac{9}{16} = \frac{7}{16},\]so $\cos A = \boxed{-\frac{\sqrt{7}}{4}}.$
In general, $\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0}$ if and only if the vectors $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ are proportional
Thus, the vectors $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ a \\ -7 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 4 \\ b \end{pmatrix}$ are proportional
\[\frac{5}{2} = \frac{4}{a} = \frac{b}{-7}.\]Solving, we find $(a,b) = \boxed{\left( \frac{8}{5}, -\frac{35}{2} \right)}.$
